The first night we hung out it was obvious he wanted to have sex. I only had one boyfriend before him so I didn't want to fuck on the first night. I told him no but he continued to touch me over my pants (and mentioned blue balls). However, I didn't tell him no about touching me. The next night he came over again and I was still unsure. He didn't manipulate me but I would feel bad if I said no. I figured it was the only thing I could provide to him, technically it's my fault (he knew I was on the fence though). Another time he forced my head during oral. I told him no and he stopped so I don't think that counts. Lastly, one time we had sex but I wasn't quite wet enough. It started to hurt and I told him but he didn't stop. He also might not have heard me because I wasn't facing him.

2,GreySoviet,1614178384,"It happened 5 years ago or so. I've used my dogs as a crutch and never confronted it. Every night, I lock my door and put my laundry hamper in front of it so no-one can get in, and I snuggle with my big Australian Shepherd-Catahoula mix. 

I am always paranoid. I break down pretty often and my family just thinks I'm a loser, because they don't know. I am a man, but I am very small. I weigh 120 lbs (\~54 Kgs) and I am very insecure. I don't know how my family would react. I don't want them to think I am weak.

It happened a bit after my first sexual encounter with a beautiful young lady. I was confident, I was happy, I was really handsome. After it happened, I began balding, I stay inside as often as possible, I am very pale and I'm always very, very tired and bored. I have a tremor, I usually can't stop shaking. 

Now I spend hours just sitting down, sweating, thinking about it, I feel numb and anxious, and before I know it it's been several hours. My family thinks I'm just lazy and don't shower, but I shower every day, I just sweat so much from anxiety. I get nauseous, and I only feel ""normal"" when I'm on sleeping medicine to calm me down.

My nails are bitten to the nub and have been for years. The inside of my mouth is full of bites, and I almost always taste the blood. 

My dog is now beginning to pass away. She is very sick and I won't have her for much longer. I feel scared laying in bed, alone. I have nightmares of it. I physically feel the pain in my dreams. It hurts. I also have a recurring dream of being forcibly operated on in a Hospital while held down. It's violation, I feel violated.

The thought, the feeling, the pain, the violation, it pops into my head randomly and I just break down.  I mumble to myself and when I'm home alone, when it pops into my head. I say bad things about myself. One of the rapist's friends called me a wh\*re. I say that to myself, because I hate myself, but I need to start not doing that. It's been years of this. I've begun fighting back, though -- I mumble, but I don't insult myself. I say ""Even a person who has absolutely nothing, still has hope, and life, and these can be used for wonderful things,"" and ""Non Sibi, Sed Aliis,"" which basically means ""Do not live for yourself, live for others."" I love my family and friends.

3,Constant-Original961,1614176577,"My stalker/harasser/rapist is free and I work with him.

Let me set the scene, there’s quite a lot to get through so hold tight and please bear with me. 

I work for a big international company with thousands of employees, there’s a shuttle bus between the staff car park and the entrance of my work place. 

A little over 18 months ago I met a man on the bus, he started speaking to me and we had a pleasant chat about work, the weather and other mundane small talk. I got off the bus and I never saw him again. 

That is until 3 weeks later when I received a message request on instagram from the same man. The message went something like “Hey, hope you don’t mind me messaging you. I found you on tinder and realised I never got your name on the bus. Would you like to go out for a drink sometime?”

I thought it was a little creepy that he managed to find me but upon speaking to my friends and parents about it I decided to meet up with him. After all he seemed nice enough and we both work for the same company so he has to be decent right?

Fast forward a few weeks, we’ve been talking, dating and we had even slept together. However I quickly realised this man is quite intense and clingy and definitely not for me. I politely told him that I wasn’t interested in a relationship but I liked him as a person so no offence but I’d like to draw a line under this and hopefully we can be friends. I didn’t want to be rude as we do work together and may bump into one another in the future. 

He agreed and decided to remain friends. We’d sometimes meet up for coffee or bump into one another at work and have a chat. Things seemed to be fine until he started calling me non stop asking what I was up to, turning up at my house uninvited (I live alone) and bringing me flowers. It all seemed very sweet and attentive, like he was trying to woo me but I felt threatened and trapped. 

He eventually started tracking my location and sending me screen shots of my tinder profile asking why I was still looking to date other men. He turned up at my house most days asking to come in and begging and pleading with me to have sex with him. Things took a turn when he began forcing me to have sex with him, like begging and begging me until breaking point where I’d eventually agree just to shut him up. I felt dirty and used but too scared to say anything because how could I prove it what was happening? It felt like rape but I hadn’t actually been physically forced or hurt. To everyone else he seemed like a sweet man who just wanted my affection but I was scared.

Then lock down in the UK happened, this is when he really began to show his true colours. Unfortunately I live two roads away from him and he’d turn up every day to check up on me and try and force me into sex. I had no one to turn to or any reasonable excuse not to be in the house. I couldn’t say I was at work because he knew people who could view my work timetable and tell him if I was there or not. He was ALWAYS outside my house just lingering or near by or just letting himself into my garden to say hello. He would call 3-5 times a day and tell me he loved me even when I told him I hated it when he said that. 

Things eventually came to a head when lock down was eased a bit in July because I could go out and see people, I started going on dates with other men and kept him at a distance. This angered him as he no longer had such a tight grip on me. This prompted him to start logging into my whatsapp on his laptop and read all my messages to check what I was up to. 

He saw that I had been out and met a guy and that’s when he flew off the handle. He rang me 40 times in an hour, texted me non stop begging me one minute and calling me a slut the next. He even messaged my friends to get a message to me and came to my front door shouting through the glass that he knew I was in. 
He let himself into my house with a key that I had not given him or knew that he has possession of, shouting that he knew I was in there because he had driven round the block to see if my car was parked anywhere. Thankfully I had the chain on the door and all the blinds closed. (I dread to think what he would have done if I hadn’t put the chain on) That’s when I rang the police and told them everything.

After a lengthy statement and 5 months of investigation they eventually told me there’s nothing they can do because there’s a lack of evidence. I sent them CCTV footage of him turning up at my house every day and footage of him letting himself into my house with a key he shouldn’t have had. I showed them message exchanges where he calls me horrible things and threatens me. Even other woman that he has stalked and harassed came forward and told the police of their experiences and still nothing came of it. Work is aware of the situation but they’ve been told by police to drop their investigation also. 

He is free. 

And I feel so let down and afraid. 

He drove past me a few days ago, wound down his car window and laughed at me before driving off. 

Now I have to go back to work and I am so scared of seeing him there and what he will say. He thinks he is untouchable and I don’t want this to happen to anyone else.

6,anon_9426,1614165063,"Let me preface this to say I am 19 now. So like the title says, I have never spoke of this in my life to anyone. This is mostly because I think I have suppressed what happened or didn’t even really understand what happened for a while. I’m not even sure if anything technically wrong happened, but I am posting this here because I can’t talk about this to anyone and I am still confused.

Around 12 years ago (I was about 7 or 8 if my memory serves me correctly) my brother and his best friend at the time who was a guy we’re all playing it in the pool. My brother is 4 years older than me so he was around 11 or 12 years old at the time. I learned how to swim quite well from a young age so it was not unusual for me to swim in the pool (supervised by an adult who was home or in the vicinity of the pool or watching from the window or with someone like my brother) by myself with no aid of any kind. Our pool was pretty deep, the deep end was 10 feet deep and the shallow end was 3. We also had a diving board and a lot of pool floats. My brother and I used to make forts out of the pool floats and noodles and other pool toys in the deep end of our pool, using the diving board as support. No one could see into the fort constructed around the diving board from the outside and the only way in or out of this fort was by swimming under the water into this fort. While you may be thinking how could you stand in 10 feet of water, we didn’t need to as we would hold on to the edge of the pool in the fort or on the actual diving board itself.

One summer afternoon my brother and his best friend and I were all playing in the pool and my grandma was “supervising” us sitting at our outside table reading a book. My brother and his friend swam into the fort and being the annoying little sister that I was, I wanted to be included and finally was able to fight and push my way into the fort. When I was finally in there with them I asked what they were doing. My brother and his friend were apprehensive at first because they said I was a girl but when I begged to know they eventually told me. They were pulling their bathing suits down and showing each other their penises. As a very young little girl I was confused and did not understand until his friend pulled his pants down and showed me his penis. My brother was also present and proceeded to do the same thing. I was confused and scared but they discussed why their penises as if I was not there. I came to find out that my brothers best friend was adopted from a foreign country where circumcising was not standard procedure and as such he still had his foreskin on. My brother, on the other hand, was circumcised as he was born in an American hospital. 

After they showed me their penises, they insisted I pull my pants down and let them look at my vagina. I was confused and didn’t understand or want to do it but went along with it because I was only around 7 and they said I had to. They made me to swim around with my bathing suit bottoms off and watched as I did so. His friend also put swimming goggles on and went underwater to watch me swim with my bathing suit bottoms off to get a better look. He also touched me, rubbing my vagina and looking all around it. Then my brothers friend grabbed my hand and put it on his penis, so I could “feel the difference” as he explained between him and my brothers penis. After forcing me to touch his and making me feel him hard and erect, he told me to feel my brothers also. My brothers friend then said that this was so that I could “feel the foreskin” and the differences. They also made me remove my top to see my chest, even though I had none. After about 45 mins of it they stopped and made me swear not to say a word. 

After this I think I became what I now understand to be hyper sexualized. I thought this behavior was normal and played games like House with my friend who was a girl and my age  that had explicit plot lines for someone who was that young. We would show each other our vaginas and other things that I feel like now as an adult I underhand was not normal behavior for a child. 

My brother and I never once have talked about it, so much so that sometimes I even will start to believe that it couldn’t have been true because when I think of my brother that is not at all what I think of. However, the memory of the pool incident is so vivid in my mind that I can’t imagine it not being true. 

The reason I am posting this here is because I don’t think I could ever talk about what happened out loud. Furthermore, because my brother and his friend were only 11 or 12 at the time, was what happened to me even what someone would consider molestation or sexual assault?? Is what happened even illegal?? I’m confused because I don’t know if I have a right to be haunted by something like that or if anything that occurred was illegal or even just wrong in any way. 

Also, I love my brother because he is my brother and I don’t even know if he remembers what happened or if he just blocked it out like I did or just doesn’t want to talk about it? Anyway, I was hoping someone could help provide insight on the situation or even just express their opinion because I have never mentioned this to a soul.",rape,[TRIGGER WARNING] Question / Opinion.

12,apparentlyaslut2,1614146085,"I don't know exactly where to start because I'm hurting a lot and I feel so betrayed, but here goes.

A backstory to this whole thing that will be important later: My boyfriend and I have dated before and in our previous relationship he cheated on me five times with two different girls.  My other ex knew about this.

I struggle with alcoholism and have for a few years.  My mother struggles as well, and has my entire life.  She gave me access to alcohol at just 13 years old and since my mental health wasn't the greatest, and I was suffering from undiagnosed BPD at the time I also developed a dependency.

I've been going through a really tough time recently, my boyfriend is extremely controlling and it's been wearing me down, but I suck at ending relationships because of past trauma.  I've been harassed by exes for the sole reason that I dumped them and I've developed a sense of obligation to stay in relationships even if I'm not happy.

So, my ex invited me to drink with him, and since I had nothing here at home I obliged.  Before anything I assured him that I wasn't interested in engaging in any sexual activity, just as a precaution because he's an ex. he agreed and I left to drink with him.

I had four shots of whiskey, a mix of coca cola and whiskey, and a glass of sourpuss, so it's safe to say I was not sober by any means. we were watching TV and eating snacks when he asked me if I wanted to play a game upstairs in his room on his PC.  I obliged again because I trusted him and I trusted that what I said beforehand would be taken seriously.  

I played for a bit, but then I got too dizzy to sit up, so I flopped over to lay down.  I went on my phone and saw that he changed the internet password so I asked him what it was and he told me while groping me.  I asked him what he was doing and he said he was touching me because I looked attractive.  I kinda just froze, I had this happen to me before and I relived it in that moment. 

He started to kiss me, and I didn't kiss back.  I was still frozen thinking about what i could do.  He took my clothes off and pulled his pants down.  I purposely fell off the bed to get away, but he pulled me up by my arms and said ""ready to cheat on that motherfucker."" I shook my head and then he said ""why? he cheated on you."" and I said something along the lines of ""It's still wrong.""  He ignored me.  He raped me, and afterwards it hurt so bad, I was bleeding and I had to crawl to his bathroom to throw up.  I passed out on the bathroom floor, and then woke up in his bed again with my pants completely off, bleeding again.

I called my mom shaking, I didn't tell her what happened but I did tell her I was plastered and needed a ride home.

The next morning, I pretended to have blacked out and asked my ex if anything significant happened the night before, to which he replied that I just fell all over the place and passed out on his bathroom floor.  Nothing about having sex or anything at all related to what happened. I called my boyfriend and told him everything, and by the time I was done he just said ""I don't know what the fuck you expected honestly.""  Then told me I practically offered myself up as bait, called me a stupid whore and hung up.  And to add insult to injury I found out that he told his friends that I cheated on him, thus getting them to gang up on me.

I'm so lost.  I don't know what to do.  Someone who is supposed to love, trust and support me blamed me for my own rape and is now slandering my name.

From the time I looked at my watch the first time to the time I heard his car leaving the driveway was a whole four minutes. “Down there” hurt for days after that.
 My friends say it’s not rape cause I technically didn’t say no. My rapist (I call him that cause he’s done it before) at first said he thought I said it was okay but when I insisted I never said it was okay, he said I wanted to before then so he thought I was just scared and that he could do it anyway. 
 
 I feel uncomfortable calling this rape even though a couple of people have told me it is. What exactly is this? Should I not call it rape? I don’t wanna be making it out to be worse than it was by calling it something it’s not, but it felt so forced and unexpected. I think I’m seeking validation but I don’t want it if it’s not true. What is this? I’m not letting it happen in the future. Situations like these have happened to me numerous and I mean wayyy to many times in the past. Everyone faults me for never using the word “no” but I was raised in a home where compliance always meant safety so I get scared and try to get out of the situation politely. I’m going to say no for now on so it’ll be more black and white. But I feel guilty enough for beating around the bush about what I didn’t want so please don’t fault me too much for it.",rape,"Got Raped(?)

21,Ace_Queen003,1614121013,So I had this guy friend and we had been friends with benefits for a while. Imma call my guy best friend Jamir. I lost my virginity to him. And I started liking him. He knew I did but kept rejecting me while still coming over and fucking me. Eventually we stopped talking for a while and I started liking someone I met online. Imma call him CJ. Me and CJ started dating and Jamir found out and started making me feel bad about dating CJ. One time he told me that dating someone online is fucking stupid. All I’m doing is having a friend who I call my boyfriend. And at the time some other dude imma call Dion started trying to get me to agree. I felt bad like I was cheating on my boyfriend somehow by letting these guys touch me and shit. Dion came over once and rubbed his dick on me and shit and kept trying to touch my butt. And felt horrible about it so I broke up with CJ. I thought to myself that maybe I just need to keep my mind off of the breaking up so then I just called up Jamir and we had sex again. Then stupid Dion kepted bugging me so then I eventually gave in. I let him fuck me too. And afterwards I felt stupid. I cried and shit in Jamirs arms because me and Jamir have a weird ass relationship. We’re close friends but sometimes he’s kinda toxic. He made me feel better....but then I got another relationship and I didn’t tell Jamir about it because I’m scared on how he’ll respond. If it will be like last time... and then he came over again today and kepted asking me to have sex with him. Initially I kept saying no. Then he started getting touchy and asked to finger me. I said no several times but then I just let him cause he said he would leave me alone afterwards. I feel fucking stupid agreeing now. Cause he didn’t stop. My dumbass body betrayed me. Cause I was wet. And he noticed and said to me that I should just let him cause my body obviously wanted his dick. I then said no again that I didn’t want to have sex. I said so several times. But he kepted asking while fingering me. And I thought to myself maybe he’s right maybe I’m just being stupid. While also thinking to myself that I really don’t want to do this. I have a god damn boyfriend! But after a while of saying no I finally fucking agreed. And god I’ve never felt stupider. What should I do?

We have a child together, and I feel like I've had to spend years ""playing nice"". I do everything I can for our kid, I never want them to know what happened. But he and his wife have it in their mind that we should be best friends, that I'm a literal monster trying to ruin his life, or I'm a terrible mom. His dad treats me terribly, and has definitely tried to use the legal system to keep abusing me. I still maintained primary custody, but it doesn't change the fact that all I see is someone who not only did things that if I had done, I would never be able to live with myself, but also that his actions state that he believes I deserved it. 

He wants to go to co-parenting therapy, and I just can't. This isn't an issue of parenting decisions, I don't want to be friends with the man that ruined my life or his wife. I just want him to take part in making logical decisions for our kid, and to love him. That's literally it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what happened:

Last year, when I was still 18 I met this older guy at a party. He was in his mid 30s, in a polygamous relationship (he was there with his girlfriend) and they immediately became interested in me. I ended up giving them my number and setting up a date with this guy. I knew beforehand that he probably just wanted to have sex with me (which I didn't want, I'm Asexual), but I decided to meet up anyways (Which was probably stupid and I keep blaming myself for it).

At first it was going pretty well, we had some drinks and talked a lot about interesting stuff. At some point he tried to kiss me, which I declined. I told him I didn't want anything romantic/sexual and that I was Asexual. After that, he kept pushing me to get more drunk; every time I wanted to stop drinking he kept telling me to just have one more drink, over and over. I told him beforehand that I didn't smoke weed anymore because it gives me major anxiety, but he pressured me into smoking with him. I got really drunk and high at that point, but I don't think I was incapacitated, because I could still walk and stuff? Also, when I get really drunk I become extremely submissive and just do anything the other person tells me to. I just zone out and dissociate when anyone tries to kiss me, etc.

So then he told me to take off my clothes, which I did. I didn't know how to say no anymore. He put a leash on me and walked me around like that. He spanked me with a whip over and over. I couldn't object, I didn't make a sound, I just laid there. Then he started to have sex with me. I never said no because I was so zoned out. I felt like I wasn't in my body. He just positioned my body however he wanted, I couldn't move.

At some point I suddenly became aware of what was happening and turned away from him. He stopped then and didn't pressure me to keep having sex. He still kept holding me tight and cuddled me while sleeping. When I woke up, I tried to free myself from his grasp but that woke him up. I was so scared. I couldn't find my clothes, so he had to help me look for them. He acted like nothing happened. I had to act like that too because I was so scared he would hurt me if I did/said anything wrong. He even hugged me goodbye and kept texting me afterwards, asking how I was feeling as if we had had a completely normal date.

From his perspective he probably didn't rape me, because I never said no. I don't know anymore. I can't stop thinking about it. So many people remind me of him now, he keeps popping back into my head. At this point I just want to know whether I was raped or not, so I can clear it up a bit in my mind and blame myself a little less.",rape,Was I raped?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lqknlq/was_i_raped/,1614064415.0

29,Throwawayacct1029385,1614083017," 

So my gf likes rough sex. I like to give her rough sex. We both get off on it. Spanking, choking, biting, hair pulling calling each other dirty names etc etc. Recently she opened up to me that she was sexually abused (rape and some other stuff).. ever since then I've struggled with wondering whether or not the reason she likes rough sex is because she was abused and if it's a way for her to ""own"" her abuse. I want to give her what she wants but I'm pretty sure if I knew that the abuse was the reason she wanted to rough sex, that I just couldn't be into it. I don't want to hurt her or make her relive trauma. She told me she likes it rough because that's just what she likes (and believe me, she gets really really wet) but I still wonder if she actually likes rough sex or if it's like a copeing mechanism. I'm probably over thinking this but like I said, I really don't want to hurt or encourage behavior that's harmful to the person I love and care about. What should I do? Should I just accept the fact that the abuse happened in the past, and that if she wants to talk about it or needs help with it that she'll tell me, and give her the rough sex that she loves? I want to give her what she needs and I like it too, but if I knew for sure that this was just a coping mechanism then it would go from being a turn on to a turn off. If there are any ladies that can chime in or give advice I would really appreciate it. Especially any ladies with a history of sexual abuse. Thank you.

Oh and for the record I've asked my gf if this was why she liked rough sex and she said she's always liked it and this wasn't why, but I just worry about hurting her because I care about her. I would like to know what other women think.

31,femexceptboy,1614065127,"So a few weeks ago I (M19) met a friend of a friend: a 26 yr old woman who later texted saying I was cute and she wanted to take me out on a date. I'm really shy and inexperienced with this stuff so I was shocked but went along with it. I was really intimidated because of how much older she is and how straightforward she has been, but I felt like we were hitting it off on our first few dates.

But then last night we were making out at her place when she suddenly groped my privates. I know I'm a boy so I should be happy about that but like I said I'm really inexperienced so I freaked out and asked her to stop. She just laughed and teased me for being shy and kept going. She took off her clothes and she took off mine. I tried to get her to stop but she wouldn't listen. I told her she was moving too fast for me and she got mad saying that if I'm gonna keep her waiting she'll stop going out with me so I guess I stopped ""resisting?"" but idk if that's too strong of a word. Like I assumed I should just do it because she probably knows how many dates to go on until you have sex?

So anyway she got me hard, put a condom on me and rode me. I didn't know what to do but just lay there. I was scared to do anything else. She took my hand and made me touch her breast many times. Stuff like that. I kind of just felt numb and empty after that but after I got home I hid in my room and started crying. like I guess I felt sort of violated after my mind processed things?

I had sex with him a couple times before but I’d gotten to the point where I didn’t want anything else. I was hurting and didn’t want anything I was trying to fill a void in my life that just was hurting me. 

He became I think almost obsessed with me. I felt he had this possessiveness that just was just insane. To show some examples of it. I was just out of a relationship he knew that. Yet he became very concerned with what I was doing and who I was doing it with. He told me he loved me. He quit his job to try spend more time with me. I know I guess that sounds nice but I’d told him I wanted space and that he was too intense for me and that I’m going through a lot and even tho at one point we had a week of fun I didn’t feel that anymore and I was just going through it. He would send me 10min long videos of him crying saying he hated the thought of me with someone else and that he’s only been good to me.  Anyway, you get the jist of that. 

The night it happened it was the last time I stayed over in his. I woke up. Immediately I had a panic attack. I was so upset with my decisions and I wanted to go home. He tried to get me to stay but I texted my dad, it was like 5/6 am. I suffer with very bad anxiety that has affected every aspect of my life. I was not in a good state. I think he knew it was the end for him and I think he was upset I wanted to see my ex bf. At that moment he raped me. It wasn’t what I thought rape was. It wasn’t violent. I didn’t struggle. I just did nothing. I was emotionless. I felt shocked and stunned. I felt so worthless. When I think back on this moment, I think maybe it wasn’t rape and if I’d just said something but I remember his face the way he looked at me, the way he said, should I stop? And I couldn’t answer barely able to speak and he finished and came on my stomach. 

I felt like something was taken from me that morning but I also feel such guilt about it. I feel like I didn’t fight the way I should have. I don’t understand why I froze or even when he asked me will I stop,  that I couldn’t speak. 

I feel as though he must have known it was wrong. He saw how broken I was and I feel like he just wanted to lay claim over me in that moment?? I don’t know. This next part is... disgusting but when I had had sex with him before he always took a good while to cum, this time it was 2 minutes. I think he got offf on the obvious fact that his actions were not wanted.

I thought I was very cool but obviously knew people would think it was weird (because it clearly was.) one day I told my mom I was going to the mall and he picked me up and took me to his house. His dad was downstairs watching TV and we went up to his bedroom. He turned a record player on really loudly and asked me to dance with him. Then he started kissing me hard, like he never had before (and I had never made out with someone). I started to push him away to tell him I was uncomfortable and he started using force and telling me that it was okay and that this stuff happens to everyone and we all have to grow up at some point. I don’t want to type out any more details other than it was penetrative rape &amp; he did not finish inside me because I started screaming as loud as I could and eventually was able to run out of the room. I ran downstairs and his dad was still sitting on the couch watching tv. I looked at him for a second, waiting for him to react or ask me what was wrong or acknowledge anything. He didn’t even look at me so I just kept running out and ran down the street and hid somewhere and called me sister to pick me up. I never told anyone about it because I thought my mom would be mad at me for having a secret boyfriend, and I also just wanted to pretend like it didn’t happen and move on with my middle school life. 
Why did his dad not look at me? Did his dad know what was happening? Had this happened before with another girl? Had the dad done a similar thing to someone? I never understood that brief moment.

The group inevitably fell apart over the summer and when I tried to bring up publicly that he had been predatory, he asked to FaceTime, telling me it had hurt his feelings, that everything he had ever done was consensual, and that he and my female friend had spoken before this call and basically chalked up my complaints to me having ""a different approach to sex"". I felt a horrible sense of guilt about it all summer, like I had thrown him under the bus. 

Fast forward to last month. Emotionally I felt like I hadn't been able to leave that time in my life behind even though I had already cut this guy off. I reconnected with an old friend from that group and all of a sudden I started having horrible anxiety and these feelings like I had lost my innocence. I tried to think back and remember anything and I started putting together a pattern that began one night last February. My female friend had offered me some melatonin before we went to meet this guy and the rest of our friends in his room. I started falling asleep. I wasn't fully asleep but I was so exhausted I couldn't move or speak. I remember my friend asking if I could sleep there. The guy said yes. The next day, I made out with the guy at a party, more intentionally this time. I got this feeling in the pit of my stomach that night, like I was empty. After that day, I didn't want to be around my friends anymore. I had dealt with some mild disordered eating habits before that night but they really picked up. I told my therapist at the time it wasn't like I was trying to look a certain way with it anymore; it was as if I was just hurting myself. I started getting these feelings of worthlessness over the next few months that led me to self-harming. I felt really stuck because I wasn't sure why I went so far and got so self-destructive. 

I started to feel panicked about that night, wondering if something had happened. The smell of the room, the way it felt, everything started coming back to me. I tried hard to remember anything and I did get some images that felt strong but I wasn't sure if I was just coming up with something to fill in the gaps. I felt so sure afterwards. I just felt like I knew I was right. I felt horribly anxious and like the world was ugly and I was angry, but I felt some sense of closure. But after those few days, everything just felt hazy again, like I can't imagine anything clearly. I told a few close friends and told them I was unsure and they were supportive but now I just feel like a liar because I can't remember anything that happened that night. Still, it gives me horrible anxiety some nights and it keeps coming up in my poetry even if I don't mean for it to. 

Could I be lying? The feelings are real and it adds up but the memories just aren't there.  I hate the idea that I could even energetically be pinning something on this guy that just didn't happen.",rape,Very confused??

The feeling of loss of control. Like your body is not your own, for far too many bodies have groped and taken it as if it is their property. Losing trust in yourself, losing trust in the world. 
Maybe if I wasn’t at that party, I wasn’t supposed to be there anyways. Maybe if i wouldn’t have worn such a short skirt. Maybe if I would have ended the conversation a minute sooner. Maybe if I would have walked away. Maybe if I didn’t get so drunk...maybe if I didn’t exist, you wouldn’t have taken advantage of my kindness. You wouldn’t have stolen my happiness away from me. You wouldn’t have flipped my life upside down, having me searching for the pieces that once were whole. You shattered me without a second thought and left me to figure it out all alone. No matter how many people fill a crowded room, I still feel empty. The pain of walking around with a smile on my face, just so no one would ask if I was okay. You didn’t think of anyone but yourself, you didn’t even know my name. You didn’t even care what my name was...it took me over a week to realize what you did was wrong. You probably don’t even remember me, but I sure remember you. I fear being left in a room alone with any man I don’t know because of you. I fear dating. I fear sex. I fear the thought of love. I feel dirty. I feel used. I feel like an object. I was never me, I was just an item for your use. I was 15. I was 23. I was 24. Guess she doesn’t matter, neither does my unconscious body on the couch, or the fact that I’d been drinking for 12 hours straight. Guess it didn’t matter that I hadn’t even spoken a word to you. Guess it didn’t matter that I was your friend. I thought saying no was enough, but I guess not. I replay it all in my mind, carrying the guilt of something that was out of my control. Keeping it to myself because “I was probably asking for it”. The thoughts that consumed my mind, that still consume my mind every day, making me lose track of my life. The scars you left on my mind and on my body, those don’t heal. They open back up and bleed each and every day, leaving me in a puddle of tears and I’m beginning to drown, looks like you win. Guess I was just a passing thought, and there you all are, engrained in my brain forever.

45,shoulditell2424,1614022442,"I was raised by loving parents, who were present, supportive and involved. I probably bordered on sheltered, and was particularly guarded when it came to men who were not my father or my grandfather (the only men my mother felt she could trust). I was not allowed to sleep over at people's houses if they had significantly older brothers, or step-dads, or live-in male relatives. I realize this is probably indicative of some kind of trauma of her own, but she insisted, and my dad allowed the sheltering. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has never drank, and has quite strong opinions about people who do, and she has also tried to raise me to take no shit... as in, being verbally aggressive if someone made me uncomfortable, and to never feel obligated to be polite to anyone I didn't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all her best efforts to keep me sheltered from sexual abuse, when I was 23, I was raped. One night out, I went from fairly sober and enjoying the night, to awake in bed the next morning with no recollection of  most of the night, how I got to where I was, who the guy in bed next to me was, or if we had had sex. He told me we had and that I was ""totally into it"". When I talked to my friend later that day to tell her I didn't feel right about what had happened and to ask if I should talk to the police, she assured me he probably didn't realize I was so ""messed up"" and that I shouldn't ""ruin his life"". So I kept quiet, and for a while, even convinced myself it wasn't rape. To this day, I don't remember a single thing from that night, apart from leaving my apartment, arriving to the bar and getting my first drink. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a lot of struggling over the years, I finally went to therapy, and started dealing with the reality of the situation. I had kept that incident a secret from everyone in my life apart from that one friend I had spoken to that day. My coping took many forms during that time; severe depression, drinking, promiscuity... all of the hallmarks. Eventually, I started telling my closest friends, but at that point, the incident had happened years in the past. They were sad, and furious, and very supportive. I didn't tell anyone in my family, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, my dad and I were having a discussion about a sports player that had been accused of raping a woman. My dad said he thought the girl was making up the incident because she was trying to get money from this really famous sports star, and I got extremely defensive, and broke down. I told him everything that had happened to me. He was devastated, and supportive, and did exactly what a dad should do. I begged him not to tell my mom, because I was afraid it would break her heart or that she would blame me for having been out drinking. He told me he didn't think she would blame me, but that it would break her heart, just as it had broken his. He agreed he wouldn't tell her, and the decision to tell anyone was mine alone. He made sure I was getting therapy, and helped to pay for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it's been nearly 10 years since the rape. My mom and I are extremely close, and I recently started feeling that continuing to keep it a secret is starting to feel worse and worse for me. It feels like I'm lying to her now, and most everyone in my life knows it happened, apart from her.

everything he says is different around other people than it is just with me, he says i’m also controlling him and doing everything i suspect he is doing to me and i always end up being in fault before him bc that’s how communicating and my sense of reality losses along with timelines of this situation progressing.

if i stay firm with the no sex thing i have to set a boundary for no masturbating around me too? it’s usually like i feel bad that i decline bc i’m his partner and then  worse that i can’t do anything else without him yelling at me or asking me to stop doing whatever else while he’s jerking off and watching me.

is this still consent or am i not in the right mind to give that? am i just being coerced? does he really keep me around to do this? i’m so torn and broken and i won’t seek help because he will continue to make my life worse than it already is if i try and leave.",rape,Is my boyfriend raping me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lpw0ud/is_my_boyfriend_raping_me/,1613990103.0
47,throwawayacc_woohoo,1614017867,"Hi! I broke up with my girlfriend of two years back in late September as a result of realizing that I'd been getting emotionally abused for the entirety of the relationship. We shared a lot of the same friends and also belonged to the same ""primary"" friend group. Immediately after the breakup, I was sitting there thinking that I'd be able to go back to associating with my ex once things blew over and I had time to heal. Over time, however, I realized that that would never be the case because the more I looked back on our relationship, the more I realized the level of how messed up things had been.

For a long time, I was under the impression that the abuse had been purely emotional (this had been an online relationship and we only met once, so I was convinced that sexual abuse and otherwise were out of the question). During that period, none of the people in my primary friend group reached out to talk to me, instead going to talk with my ex and making sure she was okay. When I confronted them about this in December, they all feigned ignorance about my issues despite the fact that I'd been making it clear to them how bad things had been ever since the breakup happened. After that confrontation, one of the friends (placeholder name Bob) came to me in my DMs and apologized for a lot of stuff. A week or two later, another friend (placeholder name Samantha) came into my DMs and apologized as well, but they acted as though any and all of them not coming to check on me was because of miscommunication more than anything else. For the record, I DID ask Samantha to check on my ex after the breakup because I realized my ex lacked a solid support group beyond our primary friend group, but I never once asked to not be checked on. The last friend (placeholder name Natalie) didn't contact me after the confrontation except for a week or two ago when they sent me a long message about how much they resented me and how that resentment was tainting the good memories they had of me. They blocked me immediately afterwards, not even giving me a chance to reply.

As I said before, I've been doing a lot of reflecting on my old relationship with my ex. This was my first relationship, so I hadn't known how things were supposed to go. More recently, I came to the realization that the abuse had not only been emotional but it had also been sexual. I'm not going to elaborate on this save for the fact that there had been multiple periods where I think I might've actually been assaulted, moreso the one time that she came to visit than anything else. I wasn't sure what to do with this information and sat on it for at least a month, likely more than that. The other day I finally let a handful of my friends know that this had all been a thing that had happened since a good chunk of them still at least somewhat remained in contact with my ex and this is the type of thing that people ordinarily want to know about because of its gravity. Most all of them (that I'm aware of) cut off contact with her immediately. Samantha, however, came into my DMs asking about why I had told people about this, told me the document was ""too personal"" and ""uncomfortable to read"", and told me to get therapy (which... I've been doing for months...). They keep acting as though my ex is still a perfectly good person to be friends with because she apparently realizes that she's done things wrong and Samantha also thinks my ex is in the wrong. But again, this is such a grave situation. I literally sent a hypothetical situation to Samantha last night during our discussion along the lines of what they would do if they saw something similar happening with a group of people they were mutuals with and nothing else: they were all friends and one of them turned out to be heavily abusing another one. Their response was that they wouldn't recommend the friend group do anything because they don't know the situation well enough, to which I asked under what circumstances any kind of abuse would be okay.

I'm at my wit's end and at this point I feel like maybe I did something wrong despite the sheer amount of people thanking me for coming forward. I don't want to hurt others or hurt others' reputations, so that piece of it stings with regards to how this has impacted my ex. Meanwhile, I don't know what to do with Samantha. We've been friends for years at this point and I've respected and looked up to them so much but I can't help but feel betrayed, but maybe that's wrong of me. I just don't know what to make of any of this and don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

TL;DR: My ex was emotionally and sexually abusive. I came forward about the sexual abuse portion of things the other day. A mutual friend is acting as though I'm in the wrong for it and keeps trying to talk to me about it for whatever reason. I don't know what to do or whether I AM in the wrong or if I'm even asking too much.",rape,Friend Won't Break Off a Friendship with my Ex After Having Found Out About Sexual Abuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lpvkqb/friend_wont_break_off_a_friendship_with_my_ex/,1613989067.0

52,Lfantlvr,1614000418,"Sex life advice w/ my bf

Hi guys, I have a question about my sex life... Sorry this is a book but I’m at a loss... 

I have been dating my boyfriend for a few years now (I’m female and in my early 20s he is in his mid 20s), he is the love of my life and he makes me very happy.. we have known each other for 13 years now... I took his virginity, but I have had sex with 2 other people... and one of my biggest issues in our relationship is that our relationship is basically sexless... 

I struggled left and right thinking he must be cheating on me since we aren’t having sex.. but we lived at his parents house, and he was uncircumcised so sex was painful for him, and I have PCOS so my libido is pretty low.. also I was sexually abused by people so I’m not always down for sex... and he is almost never down for sex...

I got a different birth control that helped sex not be so painful for me, he got circumcised to resolve his personal issues and to help sex not hurt him, and then we moved out..... and we have been living on our own for maybe 3 months now... but the sex just isn’t there 

The only times I’m ever down to have sex is if I’m under the influence alcohol or weed, my birth control kills my libido to the point I stopped masturbating and the vagina dryness hurts a lot even with lube... I used to masturbate constantly until I changed birth controls and lost a lot of weight.... 

I always felt like he was hiding something from me and he is honestly disgusted by my vagina... he doesn’t enjoy eating me out, he rarely wants to finger me or anything, he never   Initiates sex, and then if I do it’s like hurry up and get off so that we can be done... he doesn’t like the physical activity put into it, he doesn’t like how smelly sex can be.. and the fluids that go along with it... 

Masturbating for him is more convenient because it’s less mess, less effort, he is in control, he knows what he likes, 

When we have sex he literally has to force himself to cum it takes a lot of work for him and he has a lot of anxiety wrapped up into sex.. being told by all his friends how amazing it is, just to turn around and lose his virginity and find his penis to be so sensitive it hurts him and kills the erection.. was a huge let down and caused a lot of anxiety for him.. 

I’m messed up,  my stepdad groomed me and taught me to always sexually please a man no matter what and that sex was the most important part of a relationship (news flash he did this because he wanted to molest me), then my first boyfriend took my virginity he  was a sex addict and he raped me a lot but because of what my stepdad taught me I thought it was normal for a 15 year old girl to be having sex 13 times every day to please my boyfriend even if I didn’t want to.. and he would force me even if it hurt... then my 2nd serious boyfriend I dated online we met in person and he just wasn’t attracted to how overweight I had become from eating to cope with my issues... so he was not interested in any kind of intimacy with me.. the guy wouldn’t even hold my hand in a dark movie theater. (Mistakes were made and I learned hard lessons about loving myself)... and all my relationships ended in me being cheated on.. and my heart just broken.. 

Then I met my current boyfriend and he is so different from those guys..the love and patience and loyalty... but I am fucked up and struggle trusting people and I still felt like he was cheating since everybody else cheats on me.... 

Well I was secretly going through his phone to make sure he wasn’t cheating (I know it’s wrong) but I found out he is really into trans women (pre-op)... I found dick pics on his phone and only fans of woman and trans woman.... I don’t really consider this cheating especially since he has never had sex with someone else and I don’t mind him fantasizing plus he doesn’t interact with them or have them make him custom content... 

 I’m worried all the time that our lack of sex isn’t normal... maybe his testosterone is low (he is in anti-depressants and overweight), maybe he isn’t attracted to me (like my ex), maybe he just isn’t straight (his family would probably never love him again if he was and he does sometimes show signs of homophobia ).... when I found his secret and I told him I knew and I am really supportive... I will love him no matter his sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.... but it really hurt him because he was finally coming to terms with the fact that he is attracted to trans women, and that doesn’t make him bi or gay and that doesn’t mean there is something wrong with him and the he shouldn’t be ashamed of himself... but he still feels like that... 

We kinda just exist in this relationship and now we have a beautiful happy life, with a lot of ups and downs but we survived him almost leaving me for another girl and some really rocky stuff where I was being really toxic and our relationship was one sided benefiting me and only me... 

He always tells his friends he hates sex except blowjobs.... and I don’t love giving oral I find it painful with my braces and I get lock jaw easily.. but I try my best 

I know he doesn’t cheat on me since I discovered what he was hiding from me wasn’t cheating but a secret about his sexual fantasies.... I know he loves me.. we are very intimate in other ways... kisses, hugs, quality time, deep conversations, and we are pretty much always cuddling each other.... so I know there is love there and we have a connection on these aspects in my life... 

Every time I bring up our sex life he gets mad it makes him feel like something is wrong with him... 

But I’m just afraid one day he will wake up and think, he is settling for a sexless life with this girl who he just don’t have a sexual connection with... he gets me off (and if I have an orgasm I consider that good sex since my exes never did that for me)... but sometimes it just feels awkward and it doesn’t feel like we are connected... it’s not a romantic affair when we have sex... like there is something about him that is making sex uncomfortable for him and this makes sex uncomfortable for me since I rely heavily on my turn ons pleasing the other person involved... 

So I thought well maybe he should sleep with someone else so we know.... 

Either: 
A. Sex just isn’t his thing and that’s fine bc I don’t need it a lot anyways
B. We don’t have that kind of connection and we won’t ever so we can end it now before we get married and stuff 
C. What I do in the bedroom just doesn’t satisfy him and he can teach me what he likes 


He is super apprehensive about that idea because first off I’m not super mentally stable and him having sex with another person goes against my strong monogamous beliefs.. and his.... he doesn’t want to hurt me.. and it would be scary for him as well... but he didn’t give me a yes or no.. just a “you couldn’t handle it”... (honestly right now I couldn’t handle it.. but if it meant making him happy and helping him find himself and helping our relationship by helping us either grow together or part ways to find what’s best then I’ll figure out how to handle it). 

I know this story is crazy and complicated and long... but I need to know is it okay to not have desires for us to have sex? 

He swears up and down he just doesn’t like sex and he would be fine not having sex with another person there is too much anxiety and too little desire wrapped around sex... he loves me.. he appreciates what he has with me.. and I believe him. But there is that part of me that worries... 

I can’t talk to him about this without making him feel bad about himself like he is the problem... he isn’t worried I’ll leave him bc he can’t always sexually satisfy me anymore.. but I’m worried he will leave me one day or he will come out as completely uninterested in women completely... (also he does jack off to women so I don’t think he would be completely gay unless he is trying to force himself to try to be “normal”)... 

Like I said I was groomed and taught men are supposed to be sex machines and I need to comply so encountering this guy and this situation is very foreign and goes against everything I thought to be true.... also I acknowledge what I was taught was probably wrong and I’m taking this all too much to heart (he says that’s what it is)... 

I’m curious what you’re experiences are... is sex as important as everyone makes it seem, or can people be in sexless relationships and still solo masturbate on their own and be happy and intimate in other ways that fulfill us? Should I let him sleep with someone else if he wants to find out? Am I overreacting and need to just stop feeling this way and trust him and what he tells me and what his actions tell me, and accept that we might not have a conventional relationship but it honestly works for us so why mess with it? 

I only complain about my sexual needs not being met when I’m horny then I get off and then I’m good, I stop ovulating and I’m not horny any more or I go on birth control and I lose all desires and I’m fine... the thought of leaving him and being in a relationship with a guy who might want more sex than I want scares me too.... 

I’m happy with the lack of sex, and so is he.. but this doesn’t feel normal at all. To be fair I don’t know what normal regarding sex is... that’s what happens when you are sexually abused.. I’m pretty sure he was sexually abused too.. he has hinted before but never confirmed and refuses to talk about it.

Because I was drunk when this happened, it didn’t even feel real. There were times where I wondered if it really happened. But when the detective told me about the DNA, it turned my suspicion to reality.

As far as I remember, maybe I was six. I am living on an extended family. My uncle has a something like an adopted son. My uncle always calls me to massage him and eveytime he fall asleep, the adopted son would put me in the sofa and touch my private part. He'll grab my hand and let me touch his. He'll stop when he hear a noise. I was six at that time.

No one knows until now.

We moved back to our own house.

I was eleven when my sister got pregnant. We were all together even when sleeping with his husband. One night, I felt someone's touching me, I peeked and saw his husband's face. I panicked and didn't knew what to do. I was just a child. I remained silent which a lot of people woulf blame me for but I was just a child. Years pass and it continue to happen, it keeps getting worser and worser everyday. I cant get any sleep before I go to school then one day, my mom noticed. Its midnight and I was asleep. I didnt knew that he was touching me. My mom suddenly open the lights and saw him. My mom called me and talked to me. I burst into tears not understanding and understanding everything at the same time. She told my sister then everything is history. Guess what? Nothing happened. Guess what again? We're the one who adjusted. Me and my mom moved back to my uncle's house and told me to remain silence so everything could get back to the way things were. 

It affected me in so many ways. After that, my mom treated my sister's husband so good to the point that I can't understand and I wanna scream ""why?"" ""didn't he just raped me?"" My mental health got worser and worser. 

I was 20 when one night, he's drinking with my cousin. When my cousin got drunk, he climb upstairs and touched my vag. I got up shocked and scared. Every bad memories came back rushing. He immediately rushed down but I saw his clothes. I told my mom and still,  ""forget about it"", ""think about your nephews, their family would be wrecked"". They just treated it like it's normal and never cared about what I'm feeling. It still fucked my mind up everytime I remember it like today, I just got up and decided to share my story here.

I’m struggling with being in one of those phases where I don’t know if what happened to me was normal sex or rape, or if any of it was normal and I’m just overreacting?

1. This happened a while ago. I was drinking and 19 and an older guy met me on the street. He was coming on really strong with the compliments and trying to hold my hand and asking me if I had a boyfriend.

2.  He brought me back to his place and began kissing me and he ordered me to take my clothes off. 

3. He suffocated me with his body, didn’t ask consent before any sex acts, he would just order me around and change my positions for me. 

4. He was having trouble penetrating me and he told me to just relax and I was still tense and he kicked my leg and pinned it down with his knee. 

5. He didn’t stop when I told him I was bleeding.

6. He prevented me from leaving and became angry and told me he would take me back in the morning.

7. He kept telling me to tell him if I wanted it harder or deeper and he kept telling me to say it louder.

8. He tried to take photos of me without my consent.

9. I had to sneak away in the night.

60,ladybuglala,1613954551,"When I was 22 I met a guy on MySpace, and we went for a date. I ordered a long island iced tea and left it on the table when I went to the bathroom. I remember taking literally 2 or 3 sips of my drink, and I don't remember anything else until I woke up in my underwear with a tee shirt on in this guy's apartment. I had no idea what had happened. My head was really, really foggy-- I can only explain it like seeing through a streaky windshield in a massive rainstorm, my vision even was distorted. I ran out of the house. 

I never spoke about it to anyone. I thought maybe I'd gotten too drunk, and wondered if I'd just blacked out and if I'd slept with him. But I tried for years to understand how I could have blacked out that quickly. Also, there had been a few times in my life in college that I \*had\* actually blacked out and slept with people and I never woke up scared. I woke up amused. I couldn't reconcile the fear I'd felt waking up that way with the story I was telling myself of maybe I'd taken it too far. 

Over the years whenever I saw a movie of someone being assaulted I would cry. If I heard someone else talk about being roofied I'd get really angry at them for being so careless, even though I rationally understood it wasn't their fault. (Never out loud or to their faces, but internally.) 

Fast forward to now. I'm 36 years old. In the last 3 years, I've developed these sudden intimacy and trust issues that I never had before. They seem to have sprung up overnight. I'm literally scared of sex. I'm afraid of it. Part of me tells myself it's because I'm insecure about my body. But the truth is I look better now than I have at other points in my life when sex seemed fine. 

I don't understand why this is suddenly such a problem for me. Why I'm so deeply anxious about it. And there is this little voice in the back of my head that thinks, ""It has something to do with that night.""

He's a student dentist graduating in May. In summer 2020, I had a viral Instagram post exposing him for sexually assaulting me and for getting his student lawyer friend to serve me fake legal documents that claimed defamation.

Here's a short list of everything he's done to me:

\-Emotional abuse: gaslighting me into going to the doctor for imaginary mental illnesses

\-Cheated on me: I literally walked in on his 2nd date with Girl 2 (I warned her about him during their date). He claimed it was my fault he cheated.

\-Sexually assaulted me. I called the cops to kick him out.

\-When I kicked him out, he wouldn't leave my apartment. Cops escorted him out, but he came back 4 hours later. I called the cops again and they began a stakeout.

\-After blocking him, he made fake accounts to stalk me. It has been more than a year now since he has been making new accounts or asking his new girlfriends to watch my social media presence.

\-Tried to sue me twice for defamation when asking for advice similar to this post.

\-Found my address after I moved countries.

\-Identity theft: He ordered hundreds of dollars worth of food boxes to his house.

\-Hired a hitman on Craigslist.

\-Bought bots to try to report and delete my social media accounts.

He's in Canada, I'm in the USA. I tried getting a restraining order, but sexual assault wasn't considered ""enough physical harm to justify future violent behavior"" according to the police.

The girl he cheated on me with got sexually assaulted by him during their relationship. She made a post about it and it became viral. She shared my experience with him and made it viral as well. The post got out to his school (which I used to attend), but they refused to take action.

Anyway, He cheated on her with Girl 3. Ex-bf broke up with her. Girl 2 warned Girl 3 of his toxicity, but Girl 3 said she thought she could change him. It's been about a year now since this happened.

Girl 3 has recently started stalking my family and my own social media accounts. She didn't even try using a fake account. I never talked to her and never met her. I noticed her friends stalking my accounts as well, and have blocked every one of them. But, she keeps coming. I made my accounts private, but I feel like I shouldn't be the one to hide.

What do I do? How can I get rid of these people? I've thought about suing my ex, but the police said I would need to be present in Canada for about 2 years while he is on trial for sexual assault. The border is closed and I'm not Canadian. I have records of me going to counseling/therapy/sexual assault services to detail emotional distress. I have texts/receipts of him admitting to identity theft and stealing hundreds of dollars from my parents as well.

I'm tired of living in fear and wondering what his next move is. His parents work for Amazon and are extremely wealthy.

63,Toast_Girl420,1613944218,"It feels so unbelievably strange to finally admit to enjoying the time my dad took me. I actually created this account, in order to share my story yet I still feel quite ashamed. 

I'm 19F now but the event I am writing about happened when I was 13. I had been abused previously in my life and I might write another post depending on the attention(if any) this post gets. Being so young and a shy girl, I had never done anything consensual up to this point. 

I had just returned home from a gymnastics class I took with a bunch of my friends. I was super sweaty and felt gross, so I went to take a shower. When I was in there I heard the door open and figured my father was only getting something out of the bathroom. But I was startled when the shower curtain was ripped open, exposing myself to him. I could see the lust and greed on his face. At this time I didn't really know how to feel, I was just confused. 

Despite thinking of myself as unattractive I was actually a pretty successful early bloomer. At that point I already had really large breasts and a decent ass. Looking back I now realize that was the reason boys often stared at me in school. 

At first he just looked at me but eventually told me to continue washing myself, so I did. He removed his pants and underwear and started stroking his cock. I was originally repulsed but than remembered thinking that he was actually quite large. I could feel a tingling sensation in between my thighs that I can now recognize well. But at the time I didn't understand what it was. 

My dad reached into the shower and squeezed my breast. I liked feeling his course hands on them. He pulled me out of the shower, dragging me to my bedroom. Once there he pushed me and pinned me down onto my bed. I knew what sex was but was so confused on why he was doing this to me, that none of it made sense. 

This is when he started whispering things in my ear like how good of a girl I was and that he loved me more than anything else in the world. It didn't mean much to me at the time but now looking back at it always makes me wet. He kissed all over my body and harshly caressed my body. He was a bigger man with rough hands and he hurt me often but I still enjoyed it. 

It hurt the most when he plunged his whole cock inside of me. I screamed out in pain before having my mouth covered. He kept on reminding me that this was a good thing and that I would start enjoying it. He was right. His cock is quite long which allowed him to slowly enter while filling all of me. It hurt so much but it was also the best feeling. 

I had always loved him and had a great relationship with my dad, especially after my mother passed away. And instead of feeling destroyed and betrayed, this first event just made me love him more. While raping me, my own dad gave me my first orgasm. 

I do not know or understand why I enjoyed such a horrible event that would ruin many people's lives but I did. It probably makes me a horrible person but that's part of the reason why I wanted to confess all of this. 

This event, obviously caused me to develop a rape fetish. And I have continued this *unique* relationship with my father from time to time. Its exceptionally odd considering that we have a normal father/daughter relationship most of the time. ",rape,I was raped by my father and enjoyed it,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lp7jj9/i_was_raped_by_my_father_and_enjoyed_it/,1613915418.0

But being a survivor myself, and knowing I want kids someday, it scares me to think I might have a daughter and one day, she could be raped too.

One day I might have a daughter that boys pick on at the playground and some adult might tell her that “they’re only mean to you because they like you.”

One day I might have a daughter and an older man might touch her in a way that makes her uncomfortable, that makes her skin crawl, but she’ll sit there and deal with it because she doesn’t want to seem rude.

One day she’ll start walking to her car with her keys clenched between her knuckles and shine a flashlight under her car before getting in.

I know it’s a little early for me to be worrying about something like this, but it has been weighing on me heavily. How do I protect her? At what age do I tell her that things like this can happen?

One day I was complaining I was out of juul pods and I was and still am a heavy nicotine addict. He offered to buy me a whole pack in exchange for oral sex. I agreed and we met up at a location. This continued for a few months and even when I said I didn’t want to he would beg until I agreed. A few months into this ordeal he had picked me up from a friends house and had bought me alcohol and nicotine and took me over to his house. I gave him oral sex &amp; he had begun to beg me to have sex. I was a virgin at this time and I said I wasn’t comfortable with that and he began to beg and told me if I didn’t have sex with him then I didn’t love him and I wasn’t being a real friend. Again he begged me into doing it. This happened a few more times and I was 15 at this time. In the moment I was heavily depressed and relied on the attention from males. He knew all this and would beg and tell me he loved me and if I didn’t do all this then I didn’t love him. He would tell me I needed him and would provide me nicotine which again I was heavily addicted too. One night I snuck out of my friends house with her and he picked us up. We had weed in which we bought from his bestfriend earlier that night. He stopped by a gas station and got us alcohol and we planned to get cross faded for the first time. We arrived at his house and began smoking and drinking. A few minutes later I blacked out. I began going in and out of consciousness. He then told me how I owed him sex. I told him I could not consent to it and he began yelling at me telling me I owed
It to him. He than kicked me out of his house and speed drove me and my friend home. He continued to yell at him as I’m crying in the back seat going in and out of consciousness still. This was the night I came back to earth and realized how wrong all of the things he was doing to me. I cut him off the next morning.

One night we went out with friends and I got supper emotional drunk and I was tumbling and crying. He was there taking care of me I guess. And I remember waking up at his place completely naked next to him. He dropped me off in the morning. And I was just still getting the emotional drunk, that I didn’t bother to pay attention to what we did. But later that day I had flash backs. One, I pushed him on the bed. Also to note since I was just hooking up with him for my emotional turmoil. I wasn’t sexually adventurous with him. He always wanted to try anal, anal play, and 69. Things I am against trying with him. Because i just also didn’t trust him like that yet. Second flash back, we 69. Which I would never do....it always sat wrong with me. Because im aware of violence against women and rape culture. But I pushed him. But I was also drunk. And idk what other things he did or tried to do in that moment. 

Forward to years later, since it sits off with me as just one of the worst sex of life. I told two friends about it and they looked me sad and disbelief. They were all like I’m really sorry that happened to you. And it threw me off. Until one of them was like, this is not right.

82,lonewolf4201992,1613860161,"So first here is the email:  



I will make sure she reads it. I emailed you only because you reached out on FB and my personal cell phone. I used email because it is the least personal way to communicate with someone who was having an affair with my wife. I stopped emailing you until you sent this lastest one. What do you mean by ""so much for wanting this to end?""
I'll be honest with you...I really wanted to meet in person and this would have gone down SO much differently. I know she hasn't told the 100% truth about everything. It may look like my head is up my ass but it's really the opposite. You had this happen to you ONCE...this is round 3 for me but I am loyal to her to a fault! Everyone makes mistakes. All I want to know is why this can't end? And NO your wallet was NOT in her car she called me and asked me to look for it which set off red flags. I actually could believe ever word of it except the rape part. Liz has a very high sex drive but to rape someone is not something she'd do. I emailed you for closure on this. I knew most of it but you helped fill in some blanks. If I had known almost 2 years ago you thought she'd really leave me for you I'd have told you it wouldn't happen. You willing engaged in an affair with a married woman with children who has cheated on me (more than once) and thought that it would work great with you? You were not the only guy she's been talking to for the past 2 years. You fell in love with someone who could never honestly give you what you wanted. Believe it or not I told her back in June ish to keep talking to you if it makes her feel better just not to keep it sexual and she did. I really don't want you to hurt over my wife. I truly want you to heal and move on. You want me to blindly leave her because you said she did something but I ha e to take her word for it since I can refute her side. Do you not think I don't get sick and disgusted every time I think about it? I worry everyday that your gonna snap and do something stupid! I see the pain this has caused you. You told her that you couldn't see yourself raising someone else's kids and you really thought she'd choose you after that? Do you honestly think your ready to play daddy? I'll give you a shot at it if you want. Just remember it's a 24/7 job. You wanted 1 part of the affair...Liz...but she comes with strings attached. You have known Liz for 2 years and I've known her my entire life. Our parents were best friends. Our bond is unbreakable although we both have weakness. Tell me how to make this end? I am literally and honestly willing to help you! If beer and talking is what it takes then I'll do it. You want me to believe something that I could NEVER see happening. Even if...(which I don't believe she did) but IF she did rape you, then admitting it would be stupid because it would incriminate her. My job is to protect her from anything and everything and that is what I'm doing now. I understand you fell in love with her but you fell in love with a lie. You had to be hidden from EVERYONE she knew. I was in the open. I'll tell you any truth you ask because that's how I am. Liz and I NEVER went more than a week without being intimate. Last May ish when I had enough and ended it with you guys was because it had gone way too sour and she needed help containing the fallout. She was never actually going to meet with you but you could have at least emailed until you gave up. You had it all made. I could have made this way worse instead I took yours and her feelings into account and made the least amount of noise as possible while ensuring it ended. You act like I'm in the wrong. Yes I emailed you but only after you had tried to contact me on MY personal FB and cell phone. What do you expect me to do have her locked up or kick her to the curb? I guess that's the difference between true love and an affair because I will always defend Liz with my life. She truly is the love of my life and honestly I have NEVER cheated on her and never will. Most other things she's said about me are true. I have severe PTSD from the military. I have anger issues and a short temper. That's all true. I didn't realize the pain I was causing her until I pushed her so far away she ran to you. Just look at how different we are...if that in itself didn't throw up red flags...I'm 5'6"" 155lbs soaking wet all muscle no fat. You on the other hand a the far extreme. She has ALWAYS had affairs with guys that she could NEVER actually be with or take in public. It's easier to cut it off if they aren't attractive or socially acceptable. We are the polar opposites as far as body structure. I'm not here to tell you the things I've been told about you and how rude and insulting and mean you were. You emailed me 2 days ago so I responded. Tell me exactly what you need (minus her incriminating herself) and I will do my best to make it happen. 



Ok so yes I did contact him on FB and his phone but that was back on January 9th of this year because it is her birthday that day. I messaged him offering to tell him everything about what happened between the rape and the affair we were having. He said no and threatened to press harassment charges if I ever contacted him or her again and so I never did. He emailed me about 2 weeks ago and we have been emailing back and forth ever since. 

I also never once told him to leave her. I only speculated why would he still want to be with her if she continues to lie to him and me. The more me and the husband Will email, the more lies I uncover about Liz. 

I’m also upset about the remarks about my appearance/physique and putting me down. It hurts so much to hear that I had to be hidden from EVERYONE like he says implying I was such an embarrassment to be around and didn’t want to be seen with because of how I looked or me not being socially acceptable, whatever that means.... those things are just so hurtful. 

Plus where he mentions they never once went a week without having sex. Liz told me they only started having sex like a month before she told me. That would mean they had been having sex since the beginning of our relationship for like 1.5 years. Not ONLY that but he also implies she may have talked to and/or had sex with other men too. This makes me SICK and I’m in so much pain. We always had sex raw because she has an IUD so there wasn’t much risk for her to get pregnant. That would mean I’d have been at such a huge risk for getting an STD as well. HOW could someone do that?

She also told me that her husband Will had a history of cheating on her several times but in this email he states that he NEVER cheated on her. He is also loyal to a fault and is so blinded by her like I was. I don’t even get how he can still be married to someone like that.

90,Throwaway7068661,1613821179,"I have heavy trauma from being sexually assaulted by an ex a few years ago. It eats away at me because I do think of it every day, but I do very well keeping my thoughts contained and I try my damndest not to let it affect me.

On rare days, it's just too hard to keep in, and I start spiraling with one thought after another.
I start thinking about what happened and I turns into me becoming angry and ranting about how my ex treated me, then that makes me think more about what happened. It turns into this feedback loop that I have to let burn out on its own.

My boyfriend and I have been together 1 year now and he's well aware of that I had been raped. The first time I ever talked about what happened with me, it was extremely difficult for me as I had never told anyone else what had happened. He cut me off and said he didn't want to hear me talk about it anymore since he didn't like it, which hurt me so much because I trusted him with something that has ruined me. I was understanding and stopped talking about it because I didn't want to distress him any more than I already had, even if I wished I had someone to talk about it with. I never gave explicit details, just a few sentences on the day it happened.

We talked about it and I explained how I felt alone and like his feelings overrode mine.

I brought the assault up again just recently, during a late night conversation that went on for maybe a little too long. I started explaining how I felt worthless and like I'll always be a victim forever. He didn't believe me when I said I think about the rape every day, and he said he didn't understand why I would want to talk about it all of a sudden and started to shut me down or express slight annoyance when I continued to talk about it.

I kept going until I had an episode where I completely lost any scrap of self esteem I had mustered and I felt so saddened and distraught. I just broke down crying and all he did was gently tell me to stop thinking about it and stop crying.

Amidst all the crying, I tried to explain that isn't how it works and that I can't help thinking about it at all and that I can't just force myself to stop.

I told him that being touched in that moment was slightly triggering me, so I gently asked him to please stop and that I didn't want to be touched. I think he took offense to this and he got up to sleep on the couch.

It hurts me so much that he doesn't get how much the assault affected me and I feel so alone. I know he's trying to listen but it feels like I'm inconveniencing him every time I mention it. I just feel stuck and like no one will ever understand my anger and pain. He tries to comfort me but then says that he feels upset listening to me talk about it. I don't understand why he doesn't believe it affects me everyday.

A couple of years ago I started dating this guy. One night we decided to have sex and he asked if we could do it without protection. I told him absolutely not, but he kept asking and asking. Each time I told him no. He got increasingly annoyed and insistent and then after a while he just entered me. I was so shocked and exhausted from arguing with him that I just let it happen. I think he took my silence as permission and I ended up just laying there until he finished. It was such an awful experience, and to this day I still feel awful about it.
I've really struggled to call it rape (even though deep down I think that's what it is) because I feel like I was somehow complicit in the act (because I couldn't tell him no after he started and kind of 'let it happen') and because I still have some respect for the guy as a friend (even though I cut all connection with him about a year ago). 
I know this is probably really stupid but I have so many mixed feelings about the situation. I haven't told anyone about it and it's really starting to eat me up inside. 
I don't know what to do or even if I'm allowed to call this rape. It definitely didn't feel consensual but calling it rape is really scary.

After speaking to my friend she understands this as abuse and said that she should be charged on statutory grounds and it’s not fair as if it was man everyone would be slating them as a nonce and they’d be in serious shit.
She said if I’m not willing to report this then she will.

In some way I agree she should be punished but the only punishment is very heavy?

All of my previous years of self protection have officially gone down the drain and turned into a bad joke. I was forcibly raped, penetrated, and violated without my consent.

110,ShyAshley,1613756515,"I’m a high school sophomore and about a week and a half ago, my math teachers friends violently raped me.

I’m very shy about this subject, and none of my family members know, nor do my friends. I can’t bear to think about, it hurts sm and I feel changed forever. Sorry about the long post, but I just need to get it out there .. 

I live on the West Coast of the US, and we have half in person, half online school. I was walking back from classes, going to get some coffee before I went to the gym when I saw my Math teacher and im assuming his friends. They were really loud on the street, and I kept walking. I didn’t want him to notice me because he scared me already before this. Nothing happened, I was just scared of him. He’s a white male, about 6 foot 6, and mid 30s. As I kept walking, his friends (on the other side of the street) noticed me. I didn’t know this at the time. I couldn’t hear them being loud anymore so I assumed they were gone. I though I was in the clear so I put my AirPods on and started playing music. As I turned a corner, this is where things started turning for the worst. I remember it very vividly, I was staring at the pavement when I saw a guys shoes in front of me, as I lookd up confused, I saw for a split second my math teachers face. Right as I saw him, one of his friends put a bag, or something on my head and I couldn’t see. I tried yelling, but someone was holding my mouth. I forgot where I was, because they didn’t let me breath at all. After a few minutes I started to loose consciousness. When they took the bag of my head. I was in a basement of some sort, or a dark alley I don’t know. That is when they all had their face covered and I realized I was naked and tied up. This was horrifying, they started fucking my face, fucking my ass and pussy, and I screamed. I screamed so much. Probably for at least 40 minutes this happened. They were about 4 guys, maybe 4, and they ruthlessly fucked me. They hit me, spit on me, grabbed my hair. I remember one part where one of them made me lick his butthole. Then he came in my mouth. They all did. I was tired and in pain. After this I don’t remember exactly. But I know that I fell asleep. When I woke up, I was in a familiar (closed) playground, a printed pic of my nudes on the floor and a note saying “say anything and we post these”. 

I went home, straight to my room, cried, slept and cried again. My parents are both stewards for delta and they’re not home for another week. I’m alone. I don’t go to school anymore. I have no more money and I’m hungry. I want to get a birthday gift for my little baby brother but I’m broke. I sit in my room. I stare at nothingness. I feel broken. I used to enjoy sex, I’m considered a thot and a hoe in my school. Now I feel nothing.

When he told me this I was shocked. That's a five year age gap between minors. He shrugged it off as normal and had no remorse about it. He claims she initiated it. I call bullshit to be honest. After telling him that that's fucked up and probably illegal he got upset at me. He later changed the story and told me that they were both teenagers at the time. He lies and says that he is 25 and she is currently 24. They still have sex with each other to this day.


Although I know that it is morally wrong I wanted to make sure my suspicions on it being illegal was true. After extensive research I found out that it is child-on-child sexual abuse. As a (at the time prepubescent) childhood sexual abuse survivor myself I feel a lot of negative emotions and guilt. I was assulted by both a late teenager and my own father. Still have nightmares about it. I also fear that if my boyfriend and I do have children together it's highly likely that he will sexually abuse them. One part of me wants to chalk it up as him as a kid (he was a teenager) just doing stupid shit. Another part of me is screaming not to let this shit slide and breakup with him.

We had a perfect relationship going. I loved him. He put up with my mental illness and supported me. We were very compatible. We both had the same sexuality. I just can't stand to do it anymore.

I was 15 (F) years old when I had my first “relationship” which lasted about 5 months. I had been sexually assaulted when I was younger, and because of this, I did not want to have sex. When I got into this relationship, (he was 16) he was very manipulative and seemed to really only for my body, but of course I didn’t realize it until we broke up. The whole relationship, I told him that I did not want to have sex. Every time he mentioned it, I told him that I wanted to wait until marriage. 
Well one day, he had been really nice to me and we went to his house where we were alone for about 3 hours. We were laying down and he started kissing me. I notice that he’s developing a b***r. Well after a few minutes of kissing, he told me “I really want to take you there”. I told him that I did not want to have sex and that my opinion had not changed. Well, we started kissing again and the he looked at me and went down on me. After this, he looked at me and then all of a sudden just put it in. I did not say no nor did I try to stop it. I let him take my clothes off. It was not very enjoyable, and afterwards I cried because I didn’t know how to feel about the situation. Did I actually consent because I didn’t technically tell him “no”? 
I am now 21 and I’ve been thinking about it more and more, and I really believe I was either flat out raped or slightly taken advantage of. Am I crazy? Was this actually consensual? 
I am over it and I am not looking to confront him about it nor take legal action, but it would be nice to finally understand exactly what happened?

I realize next day that he first fucks me without condom. Midway thru pulls out. I turn around pull my pants up but i see he’s opening a condom. Turns me around and and fucks me again. Finishes.

His story: i was hitting on him all evening at the bar. I kissed him inside the bar (aka with colleagues around). He wants to go home but i stop him, drag him around the bar to find a place to make out and more. I french kiss him outside the bar when bar is closing. On the walk home I grab his crotch. I french kiss him again against a wall. In the backyard i grab his dick and give him a hand job. I pull my pants down and ask him to fuck me, then I ask him to put on a condom.

138,bean_thoughts,1613673776,"( 14f and this happened around February 2020 when i was 13) 

I had had alot happen so far in 2020. i had just recently came out with a rape regarding my friends two brothers who raped me back in 2018 (real long story they had tons of child porn and tried to convince me to kill my parents and run away with them) the case got canceled and they were never arrested since all the messages between me and them were long gone. my parents were so angry that it happened that they couldnt even help me or give the slightest emotional support. they never wanted to talk about it. around that time i started getting into more drugs i dont mind weed and still dont think its a bad thing. but after that it all went downhill. ever since the first rape i started to talk to older men and became very hypersexual. honestly i just needed my parents more then ever. my dad had a coworker and when she found out about me talking to older men online she was pissed and told my dad that she could help him. my dad took me to her house where i stayed for 2 weeks. worked all day from 6am to 12 at night in her backyard (they were remodeling) and in between if i took breaks she would scream in my face , use her hose on me. hit me with garden tools all well her 12 year old daughter got to sit and laugh and watch me. then she let me go home. that night i ran away because i was so scared to go back. the cops picked me up on my bike and i was back home and driven to my grandparents. around 7am his coworker pulled up really angry with her brother driving. when i saw her i panicked and ran through the house. she chased me through the backyard and then i fell. at this point she was on top of me and i was screaming so she kept trying to close my mouth. i wouldnt stop so she punched me in my jaw (was on other side of pool so family never saw this) they said they thought they were doing the right thing and didnt know how to help my out of control behavior. she dragged me outside and into her brothers car and took me back to her house. and it was the same thing as before. this time when i left she said she didnt want me back. this whole situation has left me with some pretty bad ptsd that i dont talk about. i cant even talk to a middle aged woman who looks like her without having a breakdown. but my parents said it was my fault for being so bad so i cant really do anything about that. skip forward i ran away for almost a mouth and stayed house to house with any person who would let me. during this time i had met someone who took me like 2 hours away from home. when i told them i didnt wanna have sex with them they got really mad and took me back home i kept crying and they kept screaming at me and threatened to drop me off in the middle of some where i didnt know with my phone dead. finally convinced them to drop me off at my friends. this has also gave me pretty bad ptsd that my family doesnt know about either. i have dreams of him trying to rape me( he never did but he could have). and when i see people who look like him i assume there bad people now which ik is not always the case but its hard to see past it. now flash forward to my most recent rape i met this dude on a dating app and just wanted to try some weed. he ended up giving me lsd , cocaine , vodka and rum with who knows what in it. when i woke up he was trying to put it in me and kept rubbing on the outside getting it in a couple times. (i was in so much pain due to a uti at the time) he ended up leaving for work and i panicked and tried to call someone to pick me up but my phone was on 10%. texted him and told him that he raped me and he got mad and said i better not steal any of shit shit. he ended up coming back just to make sure i didnt and i left as fast as i could. now he recorded most of this. and the detective has these videos and pictures.  they arrested him and then within a couple weeks he was out. charged with ""help with the delinquency of a minor"" didnt even get charged with rape , nothing about how he recorded it or the drugs. and only got 2 months community service. and to add on to all that. because i got raped i had to go to the rape place where they take pictures and do a rape test and well i was there i had talked to a lady who apparently was a thearpist and they didnt realize i already had one. that ended up getting all my thearpy canceled. for the whole fucking year. so i have not had any thearpy for any of these events or rapes. and still currently dont cause my dad works to much to take me. im mad. im so mad. life has gotten so much better now but my justice was not served. my voice was not heard. and i will remember that. (also side note all of this has made me so mad at the law. i had reported a boy touching me on school campus and harrassing me daily and they said they couldnt do anything about it because there were no cams in the areas i said he did it.) i feel like no matter what or where i am it will always be like this.",rape,i was drugged recorded and raped. now there only giving him 2 months community service.,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lmtv3x/i_was_drugged_recorded_and_raped_now_there_only/,1613644976.0
139,throwawey_224,1613672239,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I just want him out of my head. I’m still coming to terms with the fact that was rape, and I just idk. I’m not handling it well. I’m shaken up because I don’t know how to feel. I haven’t talked about it to anyone and I don’t even know if I should at this point because it’s over and it shouldn’t be affecting me still this bad even though it was two months ago. I’m struggling because in my head I was telling myself I wanted it so that it wasn’t rape even though I kept saying no and he kept doing it. Idk maybe that’s a coping skill? I keep going from being numb to it, to me wanting to cry and I think it’s because I don’t want to acknowledge it was rape? This happened when I was raped before by a different guy and my then ex fwb at the time told me that because I said yes when he asked if I liked it that I consented even though I was drunk, scared and hurt(his hands hurt really bad because they kept gripping my hips so hard and it hurt, I was still new to sex and he was too big) and very young( over age just to clarify, not disclosing how old I was then or now though) and then years later my friend told me that it was rape because I was almost blackout drunk and because he took away my ability to tell my friend at the time who walked into the bathroom that’s connected to the room that I wanted him to stop by pushing my face down into the bed and answering her for me when she asked if I was having fun. (I had a really rough couple of years after I left home where I partied a lot. I don’t drink anymore though) I struggle with accepting that was rape because I technically said yes but I hated it and I just wanted it stop. I think I was scared of saying no and I’ve gotten better at saying no but it’s still something I need to work on. I just feel like I didn’t get raped and I’m taking away from other peoples actual experiences with rape by calling it rape. Same thing with my rape two months ago even though that rape fucked me up more than my previous one because I actually said no multiple times and it was repeated rape over the course of weeks.

142,11651009,1613662562,"Great strides have been made in openly talking about sexual assault in the past few years. Movements like #metoo or the more recent movement in France concerning incest (#metooincest) have allowed people who have experienced such events to be more open about the issue. 

There is, however, still a type of sexual assault that is overlooked: sexual assault by intimate partners. By this, I refer to unwilling or non-consensual sexual actions committed by a partner or close friend. 

Legally (this might differ per country), it might seem straightforward: non-consensual entering of a body is rape, other non-consensual sexual advances are regarded as sexual assault, yet this black and white seems to go gray when the parties are in a relationship. 

There seems to be a certain perception of sex within a relationship that makes people think that parties in a relationship are allowed to have sex with eachother without getting consent or even ignoring it when a person (verbally) does not consent. 

Some victims or perpetrators do not realise that this is also rape. It took me personally a break-up and two more years before I realised that I had been raped, even whilst showing certain trauma responses, like avoidance of sex or dissociation whilst having sex after the experience. 

When talking about the events to some of my friends and family, they often disregarded the feelings. I have heard: “Oh but that just happens in a relationship sometimes.” or jokingly: “Well, you have got to keep your partner happy!” 

There are other issues surrounding intimate partner rape, besides the social stigma. You (might) love your partner and are not willing to report their crime or even talk about it, since it will harm not only them, but maybe yourself too, especially when you and your partner have family or a home together. You might not have the resources, social safety net or stability to leave or divorce the partner. I personally was in the position to break-up with my partner, but this was very difficult as they were a very manipulative and toxic person.  

Another big thing I noticed is that I, and many others who have experienced this, are reluctant to call the experience “rape”. There is the idea that “rape” is a very violent and harmful experience, committed by a stranger in a dark alleyway, when intimate partner rape can, but does not have to be. This is something I still struggle with, because I feel like I am diminshing the weight of the word ""rape"" by adding my experience to it. 

I personally do not feel the need to persecute the person that violated me, and that is not what this post is about at all. I wanted to share my story and give some additional information, because it helps me process it. I think it is time to open up about these experiences. 

I hope that when something like this is more openly discussed, it might create awareness for all parties involved. Perpetrators might realise that even in a relationship, rape can happen and it bears consequences for their victims, their relationships, and maybe even themselves. Victims might notice that they have been violated and help realise that their experience and feelings are valid.",rape,Sexual assault by intimate partners,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lmpfa9/sexual_assault_by_intimate_partners/,1613633762.0

146,SnowflakeQueen0822,1613652609,"Hey everyone, I posted last summer when a lot of stuff happened with me and my now-ex. This week he opened up to me about the fact that he abused his cousin sexually when they were kids (he was about 13 and she was about 9, he can’t remember exactly). According to him it only happened once but I have a hunch he probably hurt his sisters back then too, and it explains a lot about our sexual relationship and a lot of it was rape/sexual assault, which I used to not let myself believe but I’m finally starting to see him for who he is. I’m having CPS investigate him and his father (the cousin made accusations against the dad and nobody in her family believed her). I’m worried the sisters of my ex might be being abused by him or his dad and I can’t in good conscience let that happen. The signs are there, and they’re still kids.
 
 When I’ve talked about what happened to my friends, everyone’s priorities have been making sure someone investigates that house and makes sure his sisters are okay and not being abused now. Secondly they say my ex needs major counseling, I agree. But now that I’ve gotten a plan together to help the girls, I still feel empty and lost. I feel like none of my friends care about how all this makes me feel. I understand prioritizing the children, and I have 100%, but they’re acting like I have come out unscathed and that’s just not true. He hurt me too. Granted I was an adult, but he taught me everything about sex and my own anatomy when I was 18 because my parents never did. I was as innocent as they come when I was 18 and I feel like he preyed on that. I can’t wrap my head around it. Looking back on all our memories, everything looks horrible now. How did I not know? I keep asking myself that. I feel guilty cause I don’t have what it takes to hate him. I feel a million things, just not that my feelings are valid. Because the way he hurt me, it wasn’t that bad. Not like I’m movies. Not some huge deal. I didn’t even know I’d been raped nor sexually assaulted until others told me that, and even then I didn’t believe it. He played dumb and let me think he didn’t know any better. I loved him. How the fuck do I process any of this? 

I’m not sure what to even think, this is huge to me. It effects how I see the world because I fully trusted him and thought I knew him well. I spent forever getting to know him. He pursued me for two years before I’d even dated him, then we dated for three more. I didn’t rush and I was always careful. Safety has been a prerogative. I know and understand abuse, every sign. My dad was abusive. This clarifies that there’s only uncertainty in everything we do. I’ll never know how it got past me and I’ll never know if my next partner is hiding huge secrets again.
 
 Not only that, my sex life is ruined permanently because I can’t do it without having panic attacks or crying. I wouldn’t even begin to know how to explain this trauma to future sexual partners, but I’d never be able to try anything with them without evoking the reaction. I don’t know what the future is going to look like but all of this scares me.

147,Waste_Map6482,1613646805,"I returned to school early from Thanksgiving break in 2008, and, deciding to have an enjoyable evening with my friend, went out drinking at a bar infamous for serving minors.  At the time, this was a normalized behavior as I branched out in the world trying to assert my independence.  I was acclimating myself to the student culture and immersing myself in a social life where I felt accepted and carefree.  While I am now aware that this was a dangerous decision, I, in my naïveté at the time, felt it was a way of college life and connecting with others my age.

After an otherwise routine evening of consuming hard liquor, we left the bar.  My intention was to spend the night in the company of my friend, savoring what little remnants of the long weekend we had left.  We were walking when we were approached by an unfamiliar male who was approximately in his thirties.  He initially came across as very polite and charming which provided him with a disarmingly benign façade at the time, though he was extremely invasive and intrusive and lacked physical boundaries, which I now am able to see was a glaring red flag of a predatory individual.  

This is difficult for me to share because of the sentiment of intense self-blame which fills me whenever I think of it.  I relive this painful part of the narrative in my head with a surplus of guilt and, while I am now aware of the ensuing consequences, I was unable to see the repercussions at the time.

He became very possessive of me immediately, became excessively complimentary, and ultimately isolated me from my friend.  I have difficulty remembering getting from place to place, but I recall him leading me away, separating me from her.  At the time, I was having trouble both recognizing my surroundings and assessing the severity or potential hazards of the situation.  Due to her state of intoxication, she did not intervene or attempt to thwart the action from unfolding.  I do not know why he was more interested in me than her, but I am certain that he was looking to prey on vulnerable young women who had been drinking. 

I will never know why he chose me as his victim.

I recall bits and pieces of walking from place to place, vague memories of dizzy streets in the cold and the blurring of lights and faces. My head raced and my legs felt weak and perilously unsteady. He led me to an unfamiliar area, his arm over my shoulder, guiding me in my disorientation. He began kissing me and coerced me into his place, cornering me. The world felt surreal and frightening as I suddenly began to realize and anticipate the possibility of imminent brutality; that perhaps I, in all of my late adolescent frivolity, had wound up in a terrifying scenario too far advanced to be corrected.  

Inside, his demeanor changed from mildly forceful to a state of violent aggression. 
 
I was trapped alone with him. 

He became extremely domineering and rapidly shifted into a controlling, threatening individual with malicious intentions.  His charm evaporated and the frightening malevolence of his character became apparent. 
 
Within minutes, he physically and savagely took control of me. He forced me to undress and got on top of me, leaving me helpless. He continued kissing me, but there was no affection within it, only exertions of dominance. Terrified of his sexual advances, I told him to stop, but he began violently biting me. I proceeded to feel the dissociation and disconnection from the experience, splitting from myself in the process and feeling as though I was watching myself from the ceiling.  I felt so far away and distant from what was happening to my physical self, so unable to inhabit my own skin out of fear of grasping the magnitude of my own distress.  
 
He undressed himself and began to smother me, covering my mouth until I felt I was about to lose consciousness.  

He then aggressively forced me to perform oral sex on him and made derogatory sexual comments towards me, belittling and humiliating me in the process. I became fearful for my life because of his level of force and felt an extreme level of helplessness. I could sense the extreme capacity for evil within him. 
 
He kicked me. Hard.
 
He then got on top of me again, pushed my legs apart, and violently vaginally raped me while I told him to stop, that he was hurting me. He forced his penis inside of my vagina again and again. It was sustained, agonizing intercourse. He refused to stop, even after I began bleeding from the brutality of the assault and internal vaginal trauma. I remember the tearing sensation, the splitting feeling, seeing my blood stains on his sheets. We were face to face but he never looked me in the eyes. 

He then picked me up and shoved me into a wall and then pushed me back on the bed and raped me again. While raping me, he ordered me to tell him that I wanted it harder, that I wanted it deeper. I was a virgin at the time and the pain I felt while his penis was inside of me was absolutely excruciating. This was my first experience with sexual intercourse. Being ripped in half. 
 
This isn’t how first times are supposed to be.

I felt certain at that point that I was going to die, that this had gone too far for any kind of redemption to be offered. I began to think of where he would dump my body. The ceiling. I thought of my family, my childhood. 
 
He trapped me there in that room with him for six hours, which I know now legally constitutes false imprisonment, and became extremely volatile and defensive when I asked him if I could leave.  He forced me to stay and repeatedly raped me vaginally and orally throughout the evening.  I could feel myself going into a state of emotional numbness and began distancing myself from my body so thoroughly that I remained in a dissociated state for several years after the abuse occurred. I split entirely from myself psychologically and began to shut down emotionally as a means of preserving my psyche from what was being done to me.

When he was finished vaginally raping me for the last time, he got off of me, kissed me, and then gave me a smug smile I cannot forget. He smirked. 

He was heartless. 

Towards the end of the attack, he tried to take photographs of me, a detail which continues to haunt and disturb me to this day, feeling a sense of shame, terror, and profound confusion.  I still do not know what to make of this or what his ultimate intention was by executing this act.  

Afterwards, he subjected me to an act which I still struggle with on an emotional and psychological level.  He forced me to sing for him, which profoundly contributed to my decision to leave singing professionally and caused me to abandon my artistic aspirations due to the negative associations I hold with my physical body as well as my connections with voice.  It has continued to impact me over the years and still resonates strongly with my shame and guilt.

I was able to escape during the early morning hours once my rapist had fallen asleep and found my way back to my apartment in the cold; his saliva dried on my face, his semen dried on my body.  I had trouble walking due to the internal vaginal injuries sustained from the rape. I showered and sat on my bedroom floor, motionless, still feeling completely contaminated. I tried to get his scent and any traces of him off of me but I never could. He’s still inside of me, ten years later. There were bruises and bite marks on my body. After several hours of being inert, shellshocked, and in a complete state of terror and uncertainty, I called my mother, hysterical, in tears because I did not know how to verbalize what had happened, how to speak the enormity of my pain. I told her I needed to come home but I never said why. 
 
I couldn’t find the words. I couldn’t tell her what had happened to me. To this day, she still remembers that phone call. 
 
I fell into a deep depression after the assault, becoming extremely isolated and relying on self harm, drinking, eating disordered behavior, and drug use to cope with the traumatic memories and what I then perceived to be the ultimate loss of my dream.

I’m both gay (still in the closet tho) and neurodivergent :( After I had a huge breakdown. I was crying, and I asked him why he kept doing this to me if he wasn’t gay. He said it was because I was shorter and kinda looked like a girl so it wasn’t gay? Which is true I’m 5’7, and I take after my mom a lot, but it is gay because I’m still a boy???? Why does he keep hurting me if he isn’t even gay? It hurts so much. I just want him to stop. And if he’s so homophobic why does he keep sexually abusing me?

150,juaimf,1613625860,"Hi
You may of heard or read about this case that is currently in the media in Australia. The thing is this almost identical scenario happened to me. Out for drinks with colleagues sitting down drinking, no food. Realised I was a bit drunk and got up to leave, stumbled and then woke up naked in older colleagues bed with him attempting sex with me from behind. I stopped him and went to get up and there were used condoms on the floor and clothes strewn but not mine. I asked where my clothes were and he said “in the kitchen”. I walked naked to the kitchen and my clothes were folded nearly on the kitchen bench (not what I would do if I was drunk). He pieces together the night for me and because they didn’t know where I lived he and a girl from work took me to his house as I couldn’t speak and they put me to bed fully clothed in his spare room. Put the blanket over me, turned the light off and closed the door. I’ve never found out how I got to his bed. I did report it to police twice (the first time they didn’t actually make a report as they thought I just wanted to talk). Police said it is hard to prove and “maybe I woke up and wanted it”. I absolutely didn’t fancy him and I remembered wanting to go home. The girl that left me there asked me what I thought when I woke up - did I know where I was? Leaving me to believe it was obvious I wouldn’t know. The law where I live makes it rape if a person is too intoxicated to consent. 

Anyway this case in the Australian news at present is very similar to my situation. She also didn’t go to police because of her job and no charges have been laid. They haven’t really said who the guy is but they do state an older man. He has checked himself into hospital probably out of shock that what he did is tape. I honestly don’t think many older generation men think it’s rape if a girl is trashed and my experience with the police indicates either do the police.

Hoping this case brings some much needed attention to rape when a woman is intoxicated.

Any thoughts and comments?

151,IllChard6445,1613623062,"I (16F) was molested and raped by a man I considered to be like a grandfather to me.

I was 4 the first time the touching started. I didn't understand what was happening. Just that it hurt. It continued until I was 8. 

I moved to a different state that year. I felt like I was free.

Four years later, when I was 12, he moved across country to be closer to my family. He only lived 20 minutes away.

The first time he saw me since moving, he took me out for pizza. He raped me in the back of his car.

On multiple occasions he beat me, threatened to kill me if I sreamed, and even held a gun to my head. 

This continued for two years, until I was 14. He moved back home to the state he's from and I only saw him during visits.

He died of a heart attack a year later just after I turned 15. I was so relieved. I thought it was finally over.

I never took into account that even though it meant the physical hurt was over, the nightmares, panic attacks, and flashbacks would persist.

Things that remind me of him send me into episodes of panic so bad that I sometimes even forget where I am. Heavy boots on floors or stopping, yelling, guns, violence. Anything and everything. 

I see him everywhere I go. I hear him in my sleep, reminding me that he'll never go away. That it's my fault. That he should've killed me when he had the chance.

152,Warmpebble,1613621586,"A flood of memories have come to me in the past year of things that I've possibly suppressed and I am a little confused and trying to see if anyone else has experienced something similar. 

3 years ago I have been able to remove myself from my super uncomfortable family situation (all centered around functional alcoholism and sex addiction of one family member). I had some issues with anxiety, panic attacks and random intrusive flash backs during intimacy but have put in the work to really heal and currently feel better than ever before. I finally feel more or less at peace and safe. 

Here are some memories/instances that have come up in dot points:   


3 - 7 years   
\- Constantly engaged in weird sensual activity when I was about 3-7 years old with this single family member (alcoholic) including joining tongues, licking eye lids and ear lobes, excessive cuddling  
\- Exposed to inappropriate material for a child with swearing/adult cartoons with sexual themes   
\- Explained to what a lesbian is when I was 4 years old in sexual manner (not ""attraction/love towards another female"" but about sexual acts between two lesbians) during which I remember feeling uncomfortable  
\- Being obsessed with kissing and sex as a kid for some reason ( have old, ""funny"" VCR of mum walking in on me making my barbies make out during bath time... which could just be normal kid curiosity)    


10-13 years  
\-When family member came in while I had no top on and covered myself and shrieked I remember them saying that I have nothing there anyway and that they should be allowed to see either way  
\- Coming in to the bathroom during my bath as I covered myself and had soap bubbles covering everything, pleading to see my public hair, which I kept declining   
\- Overall being obsessed with my puberty progress which made me super uncomfortable  
\- Knowing this family member visits prostitutes from 12 years of age as family was quite open about it  


14-23 years  
\- Inappropriate sexual compliments/comments towards me during and after puberty and even now  
\- In a drunken state, saying that they would force me to perform sexual acts as they are really craving it, but won't as it is incest, implying they are a good person for it  ( I was 17 at the time).   


\--

But something that makes me question everything, is that all throughout ages 3-6 I remember constantly going to the doctor and constantly having problems down there and having to sit in special medicated water at least once a week because down there was always red and painful.... which makes me think.. why? It's just an overall uncomfortable feeling really, and I am unsure of what to do with it.

But over the past few weeks I just can’t seem to get out of this slump. My assault wasn’t even “that bad”—it wasn’t violent or painful, there was no penetration, and it was with someone I had already had consensual sex with—but it’s been haunting me. I’m more or less able to keep it together for my classes and getting the bare minimum of work done, but I can’t sleep, I have constant anxiety, I’ve tried to make it go away with smoking and drinking, but I feel like I’m suffocating. I know I should be in therapy, but it’s the details that bother me the most and I just can’t imagine actually saying those things aloud to another person.
I don’t know why exactly it’s so bad this time, maybe it’s the isolation of the pandemic, or the fact that the weight loss has made me feel like an actual person again, someone whose experiences and feelings are valid and legitimate (I know that I shouldn’t have had to lose weight to feel like a person, but it is what it is). But sometimes I feel like I must just want to feel like a victim, because otherwise I should be able to get past this.

However, a couple weeks ago he assaulted me in my sleep. He 100% wanted me to stay asleep as he did it because I remember him slowly pulling my pyjama bottoms down. When I felt this I just froze because I was half asleep and confused. He then tried to finger my ass (which typically I only let him do on occasion because he knows that I find it uncomfortable) so I pushed him off quickly and sat him down and explained how I wasn’t comfortable with him doing this. I explained to him how this could even be seen as sexual assault by some because I was unconscious and there for unable to give consent. He seemed genuinely sorry and promised that he wouldn’t do it again, so I forgave him. I put it down to immaturity because we are both only 18 years old. 
We didn’t bring it up again until a few days ago he did the exact same thing :( I shoved him off of me immediately and asked why he would do that again, but he just started crying and told me how sorry he was. He told me that he knew it was wrong but he just did it anyway. He now thinks we should break up because I deserve better than him and he says he’s disgusted with himself. Honestly I don’t know how to feel, I know I should be angry with him but I just feel bad for the both of us and I’m terrified of losing him. I genuinely pictured us spending the rest of our lives together but maybe I’m being stupid. 
Also, I feel really uncomfortable saying this but a couple nights ago he sent me a picture with a toothbrush in his ass captioned ‘we’re even now’.

161,HannahPierce0500,1613609995,"I’ve posted here before, but I keep feeling like I’m lying to myself when I think that I was raped. So on June 5th, 2020, exactly a month before my 15th birthday, my boyfriend of 2 weeks, 18 years old, texted me early that day saying how he wanted to have sex that day. I wanted to have sex and lose my virginity, but I didn’t wanna lose it that soon into a relationship since my last 3 relationships before then had only lasted 3 weeks and I wanted to be in a relationship who took it for a decent amount of time. As a result, I told him no and how I wanted to wait, to which he replied that he didn’t wanna wait anymore. We went back and forth for a bit before he said “we can have sex today or you can save it for someone else”, and I pleaded, and I mean like begged for even an extra week, and when he said no, since I didn’t wanna lose him, I just said “we can see what happens”. I asked my parents if him and I could hangout later that day, since I really wanted to see him, and I barely got to due to my school forcing us to do google/zoom meets. I was excited and really nervous to have sex (which still insanely confuses me to this day as to why I randomly got excited).

Later that day when we were hanging out, things were good, we got lunch/dinner, it was like 430pm ish, so idk what u wanna consider it lol, then we sat in his back seat while we ate it. Then we went to the woods where we first met in person, and we went into his backseat again. This time, we started cuddling a bit and then the stuff I was comfortable with (me giving him head, him fingering me, us making out, etc). Then after he came, he motioned for me to sit on his lap (after he put a condom on) and so I slowly went over, insanely nervous, and I started riding him. After a bit, we switched to doggy since I’m submissive and my legs were tired. Sometime shortly after we switched positions, idk if I passed out or something, but I remember coming back to like I’d passed out and having no idea what was happening at first. After maybe a minute I realized what was happening, but I couldn’t feel anything down there, like I knew he was like thrusting in and out, but I couldn’t feel anything and I wanted it to be over and to stop cause I didn’t want it anymore, but I didn’t say anything since I’m my eyes I’d already given consent earlier, and he was probably close anyways. Afterwards when he finished, I really regretted what happened, but I didn’t say anything since nothing could be done and I couldn’t get my virginity back, and so I just pretended I was fine while we went to a lake and got into the bed of his truck to cuddle. He said he saw me as a friend a week later, and we broke up. A couple months passed, I’m with a new guy who’s amazing, but I started to get bad nightmares of my ex raping me in the backseat of his truck (rape as it’s shown in like the news and stuff). I’ve also been scared of Ford vehicles, specifically black Ford F-150s and jacked up trucks, as well as any guy who looks or sounds remotely like him. I get bad panic attacks when I see those things and I don’t even know why. Thanks to anyone who read all of this.

As the title indicates, my significant other [F30]was raped a little over a year ago. I’m doing my best to be understanding and supportive and it has become. Wry difficult. 

The scenario is that she and a friend also [F] went away to Vegas for a weekend to see a concert. All her idea and planning. The second night they were there, they met a couple of guys and invited them back to their room to hang out. We’ve never really addressed how this was somewhat wrong on her part since we were together but the idea was that her friend was single and it was more for her to meet someone. While her friend was hanging out in their room with the guy, she went to have a drink with the other guy as friends and she isn’t certain if she was drugged or not or just got too drunk but she went back to his room and was raped several times. From what I understand now, she was too afraid to say no and too embarrassed and hurt to call the police after. 

They came home immediately the next day and she became hysterical. Lots of crying and yelling and blaming me, saying things like “where were you?” And other unreasonable comments because she went away on a girls trip and made some choices that weren’t the best.. I have never blamed her for any of it but she has also never apologized for blaming me and I think that has left some weird feelings. She sought medical attention and therapy. She sustained an STD that she will have for the rest of her life. We have not had sex since snd it doesn’t feel like we will any time soon.

As far as the ""rape"" goes im not even sure if it was or if I'm over reacting, I don't think men can be raped but I'm not sure? Only one of my friends knows and he says it is but I'm really not sure I don't think so but I figured this would be the best place to ask.

And well, I guess I'll tell the story. But the thing is it doesn't really bring me any pain to tell, and I don't really feel traumatized, just grossed out by describing the sexual acts themselves.

When I was 7 I used to hang out with one of my friends in my parents garage, we'd set up tents and pretend we were camping, but we'd bring out a laptop.

i started talking to someone and instantly fell in love with them. they are my dream person. i am a huge empath and lover and love my significant others (monogamous) with my whole being. but shortly after becoming friends, i discovered through multiple sources that they have supposedly raped and physically hurt different people in the past. they don’t know that i know yet, and i haven’t brought it up yet. the time hasn’t felt right yet. but for some reason i just find reasons to keep loving them... i can see that they want to change and move on from that version of themself. what’s more confusing to navigate through is that i am a victim of rape myself, (which was in the past long before i started talking to this guy). so a part of me feels wrong for not having more empathy or so called respect towards myself and for what i’ve experienced? i wouldn’t wish rape on anyone. but i never expected to fall in love with someone’s rapist/abuser. and if i were to argue; what about all of the people who are in love/married/friends with people who used to rape and will just never know or find out. are they any more in the wrong than me for keeping them in their lives? for loving someones new version of themself? am i even wrong myself for feeling this bond so deeply before finding out their past? does someone’s past define their future?... don’t we all deserve a new start? he burns a feeling inside of me that nobody has ever been able to before. its like im under a love spell. it’s a physical feeling by just the thought of them that ive never felt before with any past “love” of mine. perhaps this is my empath coming out. my “maybe i can change him” mentality. however I feel there’s nothing to change anymore. he’s trying and striving to be a new person from how he used to be. now all that’s left is he needs to prove himself with my trust and safety........ is being with the love of my life worth that risk?",rape,im in love with a rapist/abuser,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lm5148/im_in_love_with_a_rapistabuser/,1613568055.0

173,This_Bad8764,1613594997,"I am writing an essay on marital rape in the US and I am looking for stories from other marital rape survivors. Please share your stories if you feel comfortable doing so. 

I was in a nearly 7 year relationship then marriage with a partner who sexually abused me on a very regular basis. I didn't realize until we'd been dating for about a year, and when I did realize he was having sex with me while I was sleeping, I didn't know what to do. I had been violently raped before entering the relationship and perceived rape to be just that. I finally divorced him in 2015, but the mental and physical repercussions have been extreme. When we were married, I would have regular UTI's, averaging at least 6 a year, with one year going over 12 UTI's. I didn't know exactly why I was getting them because before that, I only got a UTI when I didn't pee after sex. I realized later that those UTIs were the result of my husband raping me in my sleep or while I was intoxicated and not waking me up afterwards (I mean, how do you wake someone up after raping them to tell them to pee?). Since leaving him, I have only had 2 UTIs total in over 5 years. And both of those UTIs were while I was serving in the Peace Corps and had very limited sanitary resources. 

I am still within the statute of limitations to press charges against him, but I do not have the time, money, or resources to do that.

I had been talking to this guy (we’ll name him Greg). I have met Greg in the past when I was younger and had played xbox with him once. When I went to college in 2019, I was on Tinder. I had matched with Greg on Tinder and thought he was cute. November we were texting a lot and I started to gain feelings for Greg. But my suspicions arose when we were texting and he was trying to get me to come and watch Netflix with him in his dorm. I remember I responded with “I’m not that easygoing.” I put what he said past me and blew it off. We planned on going out to dinner once I got back to school. That night we met up, we got into an uber and we went out to eat. We ate and left to go out to walk the streets. We arrived by the oceanside, and he kissed me in such a way that I didn’t like but I pushed it past me. We decide to head back to my dorm room so we call an uber back. In the uber I was sitting on the left backseat of the car. In which he proceeded to grab me and pull me onto his lap. I remember I tried to inch off but he held me there. We get to my dorm I sign him in. Disregarding how I felt and what had just happened in the uber we start kissing in the elevator. We get to my dorm room and this is where things get fuzzy. I can’t remember how it happened at all. I try so hard to see if I can remember details but all I recall is that the feeling I wanted it to end. The only thing I strongly remember is me going down on him and asking me to deepthroat, and I looked up at him and said “No”. I remember laying naked in my bed feeling powerless to what had just happened to me. He left and slammed both of my dorm room doors and I never saw him again.

176,throwaway048080349,1613584289,"So I (19F) had a FWBR with a guy (21M) for a few months. It ended pretty dramatically and it’s a very long story.
He was my first time and he was nice some times, but I feel like some of the stuff he did wasn’t right.

For example he knew I was a virgin and not on birth control, but he still had unprotected sex with me, without telling me the first time.

Luckily he put on a condom when I found out and asked him to. He had also told me he liked anal sex, and I wasn’t dismissive of it but I did not expect for it to happen the first time.

When he told me to roll over, I first didn’t want to, but he insured me that it was just going to be vaginal. It was at first, but then he suddenly stuffed sex toys up my anus and had anal sex with me.

I didn’t tell him to stop when he did it I just froze and waited for it to be over.

Later I confronted him with this, but he told me that he asked me if I wanted anal before he did it.

I must admit I don’t remember him asking, but I also fear i might be remembering wrong, even though my memory is usually very good.

He also did a lot of other things, like:

The second time we had sex he commented on how I had become more “loose” since last time.

One time when I was giving him a blowjob he also pushed down my head, while telling me that “I could get it further down”, luckily he stopped when I was able to tell him that I was almost about throw up. 

Then not long after he choked me and when I told him that I could barely breathe, he just replied “Well, that’s the point” luckily again he stopped soon after. 

Then the very last time we had sex he again wasn’t wearing a condom, and did not tell me until I asked him if he was. I asked him to please tell me he wasn’t wearing one the next time, but he just shrugged and kept having sex with me.

He also once kept having sex with me, even though I told him I was in pain.

I feel a bit guilty because I kept contacting him to have sex. I actually really wanted to have sex with him and sometimes it was good, but I feel like some of the the things he did was just way too much.

i was saying i wasn’t sure and stuff but then he got on top of me and started basically putting it in my mouth and saying ‘just lick it’ even though i was kinda tryna keep my mouth shut

180,fentyhealthcare,1613508637,"i recently told my friend about this and she sounded concerned.. so i’ll share a brief synopsis of this story. about 14 years ago (when i was 9) me and my family went on holiday to the canary islands. at the hotel we were staying at we met a few other families with kids/teens our age (i was with my siblings who were 16/18 at the time) anyways- i specifically remember two incidents involving one of the boys who was around my older siblings age (16-18). the first was less ‘serious’ - he pulled down my shorts when i was around everyone and exposed my underwear, at the time i brushed this off as him just joking around.. but he did not do this to anybody else, and it seemed very strange to me that he would do this to me specifically.

the next incident really shook me and i can recall feeling uncomfortable for the remainder of the holiday - me and a few other kids were playing pool one evening, i remember bending over the pool table when this same guy squeezes my ass cheek for about 5 seconds. i can remember not knowing what to do.. i had never been touched in that way before even in a ‘jokey’ way. now when i’ve given this thought before i’ve always thought he was clearly just joking around and that i shouldn’t take it seriously, especially considering i was a boy and so was he. but i remember looking at him after he’d done this and him just having the most blank look on his face, not even a smirk.. i avoided him for the remainder of the holiday. i can’t even remember his name.

191,throwaway2789218,1613447144,"TW; sexual assault involving children, discussion of cnc, discussion of sex, discussion of mental illness, etc. 

hi everyone. this is kinda difficult to write. for many reasons. i don’t want this to be super professional &amp;amp; i’m not gonna go back &amp;amp; make sure my spelling is perfect or my grammar is perfect. i just want this to be natural &amp;amp; free flowing. i just need to get this out. this is probably gonna be long &amp;amp; all over the place, so if that’s not your cup of tea, i just understand. i just need some help. 

i fear that i was sexually assaulted as a child. i don’t know if that’s the right phrase to use. but if fear that i was touched or forced to do something sexual or something similar to that nature as a child. i guess i’ll explain why i think this &amp;amp; give some backstory. 

i have a VERY intense fear of men. now to be fair, i do have severe anxiety &amp;amp; paranoia. so this could be an explanation… but it still doesn’t make sense to me. walking on the same side of the street as a man is scary for me. sitting near men on public transport is terrifying for me. i would rather walk wherever  i’m going. i’ve gotten off buses before because the only spots to sit or stand were near men. i will wait in long lines at stores to get a female cashier. i’ve left stores before because i got to the checkout line, only to find all male cashiers. at school, i will not talk to my male teachers/staff members. if i don’t have a choice, i have panic attacks &amp;amp;/or shake/cry the whole time i talk to them. i’ve had a rocky relationship with my father for almost my whole life. as a young kid, we had a close bond. but as i got older (10 years old?), our relationship really crumbled. there are many reasons but some include; his pretty bad anger issues (which could also explain why i’m scared of men), the divorce between my parents, me living with my mother after/during the divorce, my fear of/anxiety around men, etc. it’s very hard for me to determine if certain thoughts i have about him are connected to possible abuse or just my paranoia/anxiety. for example, i missed my period for a year &amp;amp; i was terrified that i was pregnant. that logic didn’t make sense because i never had sex before. i remembered that i had slept over at my dad’s house one night. for a good nine months, i worried about my father raping me in my sleep &amp;amp; that i was pregnant. see, this could just be paranoia. but is it just paranoia? 

i am a very sexual person. i’ve always been a fairly sexual person, even as a child. i believe i started watching porn/kissing videos/adult content at 6. i watched a lot of adult content. occasionally, i would explore my private areas while watching these things. i didn’t start masturbating until… 11? 12? it’s hard to remember. but regardless, i’m a very sexual person. once i graduate, i plan on being a stripper &amp;amp;/or sex worker to make income. i’ve always wanted to fulfill people’s fantasies &amp;amp; please people sexually. i want to help people act out their biggest fantasies &amp;amp; desires. now this is the part i’m super embarrassed &amp;amp; horrified about. i have some intersect in cnc. i’ll make it very clear… i am 1000% against being raped. but i am interested in consensual non consensual sex. i’m very ashamed of it because i would never ever want to belittle sexual assault/rape survivors. i’m very fearful of being legitimately raped. i consider myself a very “easy” person. i will sleep with almost anyone. i like being degraded &amp;amp; told what to do &amp;amp; i’ll do just about anything. if i’m out at a bar &amp;amp; a guy asks to see my tits, i’d flash him. again, i want to make it super clear, i am 10000% against legitimate rape. i only mention these fantasies &amp;amp; sexual interests because i think they are relevant. i totally understand if people think it’s disrespectful &amp;amp; wrong. trust me, i know. 

(i’ll just fire through some things that i think are note worthy) i do have a condition that impacts my memory. it’s called aphantasia. it’s the inability to visualize things within the mind. it can impact your memory &amp;amp; it definitely impacts mine. now here’s the thing… aphantasia can be developed after trauma. it’s definitely possible that i was able to see things in my mind as a child. sometimes it feels like i can almost picture things from my childhood. but that might not mean anything. but my memory is absolute rubbish. like garbage. so it makes it insanely difficult to even try to think about my childhood. like i said before, i have severe anxiety &amp;amp; paranoia. this could be related to trauma. i have severe trust issues. like severe trust issues. even with family. i have an insanely hard time saying no to people. like a super hard time. if someone offered me heroin, i’d feel bad/awkward saying no. i’m very anti-relationship. i don’t believe in love &amp;amp; relationships. i don’t believe in loving someone for forever. i go have some anger issues as well. i am pansexual. it took me quite a while to figure it out. for context, i’m female. i feel much more comfortable around females. i often doubt my sexuality tho. i feel like my fear of men made me pansexual. but that might just normal “struggling with your sexuality” things. i’ve always had a “dirty mind” even as a child. i have a fear of germs but this has only developed over the past year (not related to covid.) i read this article on warning signs that you’ve been sexually abused as a child. one section asked; “do you suffer from any of the following? 
- depression
- anxiety and social anxiety
- sleep disorders
- eating disorders
- self-harm
- suicidal thinking
- low self-esteem
- identity crisis
- addictions
- sexual problems
- panic attacks
- OCD around cleanliness or self-care
i suffer from every one of these. several social workers &amp;amp; therapists said it’s possible that i also   
have bipolar &amp;amp; paranoid personality disorder. 

anyway, i’ll probably wrap this up now. i’m immensely sorry if this offended or triggered anyone. i deeply apologize. i just need some help. i’ve debated posting this for so long &amp;amp; i just need some help. it’s eating me alive. there are many others things that i could mention in here, like my dad “pressuring” my mum into having kids or my dad’s severe anger issues. but i think i’ll leave it here. please be open &amp;amp; honest. i’m still very hesitant to even entertain the idea of sexual abuse. i don’t want to make something out of nothing. i take sexual assault &amp;amp; sexual abuse so seriously &amp;amp; i would never want to make myself a victim. even my own mother &amp;amp; aunt have started to wonder if something happened to me as a kid. it’s scary to me. but honestly… it would explain a lot. again, i am so insanely sorry if this comes off as offensive. i don’t mean any harm. i know you can’t speak on behalf of every sexual assault survivor. but i’d appreciate the input. also, i know you obviously can’t determine if i was sexually abused as a child just by reading this post. like i said, there’s tons more that i could get into. 

thank you. i’m sending loads of love &amp;amp; positivity to you all. again, i’m so sorry if this is problematic. 🌻🖤

194,trashytrashaccount10,1613442286,"First guy I met online and agreed to spend the night with. We met once before during which we kissed/made out after we got to my car and he kept saying how he'd love to be my first kiss even though I was clearly unsure. His first text to me was literally ""Hey, I didn't want to force you. My bad."" I stupidly spent the night with him a few days later and despite telling him numerous times that I did not want to lose my virginity then, and saying no/pulling my shorts up a couple times, I ended up giving in. He also said he was tested and clean, so I'm not sure if he was lying or didn't know.

Second guy was FWB during an open relationship. He would be very persistent and nag a lot if I didn't want to hook up (we were in this weird friends/hook up limbo and I lacked experience so didn't understand that coming over implied hooking up?) There were a few times he would wear me down by asking a ton, trying to compromise by putting his dick in my face asking for a bj or hj instead saying ""c'mon, 30 seconds."" Multiple times he'd try to physically move my crotch to his face (despite knowing I wasn't into that with him &amp; kicking him away/turning away.) One main time I remember kicking at hime and saying no, after trying to sleep didn't work, and he still grabbed my legs till I gave up and let it happen. Then I remember turning away and trying to be on the other side of the bed from him and pushing him off when he tried to cuddle. I confronted him about ""making me have sex"" with him and his response was half apology, half he wanted me to be more ""affectionate"" with him.

197,knives78,1613441411,"it’s been about three years since the incident  I believe and since then I’ve just kind of threw it away and chose to not think about it nor even let myself go back to that. the thing with this is that it was sort of a relationship but not really bc he was just an abusive person in my life and I never even consented to the relationship continuing after I officially broke it off. A while after evrything that happened I decided to just take charge and see if I can ever experience something like that again or if I can just update my experience with someone else and I tried but it didn’t work I felt super uncomfortable and ended up doing nothing serious. I got into a relationship sort of recently and like I said those memories would come and I would try my hardest to shut them out. I feel like when you go through something like this your head is just never right again. Anyway in this relationship i was asked the question if I ever had experiences orally and I said yes but I genuinely believed it was with the person I tried to update my experience with let’s call them “blugh.” I recently came to this discovery because I talked to my bestfriend about it who has been there for me since the start of all this. I always felt crazy about that experience with blugh and ashamed that I would do that with someone I didn’t have a real connection with so when that happened I told my bestfriend about it but when I opened up abaout that I opened up about my rape and sexual assault. This was about three years ago. I think I mixed them up in my head because when the other incident happened I remembered I didn’t want to believe it bc he came apologetically to me about it and told me that’s probably not exactly how it happened bc our environment was intoxicated and I probably got a second hand high or something and he would never do that to me because he loved me blahblahblah. anyway the point is I already told my boyfriend I did that with someone else I sound crazy switching the story up and down and it would kill me if he didn’t believe me bc it was so hard for me to process this just now but I do feel somewhat better having little to no holes in my head about some memories. I just feel broken and like a burden how do I even explain this?

She then told me his dad had drugged and raped her. We cried together about it.

She told me in detail about waking up in his bed naked and him telling her all about how he raped her. She went to the hospital to get a drug test and it came back positive for date rape drugs. She never ended up going to the police as she couldn’t go through with the trauma of court but of course cut ties with him and made sure she would never be around him again. 

My mother and I are very close so the anger inside me is just absolutely boiling me alive and I’ve not been able to think straight because of it. She told me this months ago but I am still at my boiling point about it and want to go over to his house with a sledgehammer honestly. I’ve never felt anger like it.

205,Frida2108,1613412997,"Hi guys, I don’t use Reddit that much and I’ve never posted anything but i really need some perspective (i’m 21 and a female).
When I was 18 i was raped by a random guy (He was 20 at the time) He and his best friend  picked me and my friend up from a party (they were going to drive us home because we were both really drunk). I was with my rapist in the back seat, his friend was driving and my friend was in the passenger seat. He drove my friend home and then i said that my house was just in the next street but he drove past it (said they wanted to drive a bit more around town and then they would drive me home). I said i really wanted to go home now because i was really drunk and just wanted to go to sleep. Long story short i was suddenly at my rapists house and he was leading me inside. I looked at his friend who was driving. I was terrified and i thought he would help me. He drove away. When i was inside i said no multiple times but at the end i froze and he raped me. 

For a couple of years i tried to forget this, just pushed it aside and thought that was it. Last summer i got a nightmare about the rape and then I sought help. 
It’s going really well and i’m making a lot of progress!

But.. last weekend i was at a small party (i know there is a pandemic but i live in a country where 20 people can come together). But basically his friend that was the driver was there. I panicked! I didn’t know what to do! But he came to me and introduced him self.. he didn’t recognize me.. I had to tell him what happened with his friend. I thought it would help.. and it did! He was so understanding and he told me he had no clue about it and that he was going to talk to his friend about it and he was very sorry that it happened. I was so pleased and he was so kind and i was so happy that i got a chance to talk to him. 

When the party was coming to an end i heard that he was going to walk home because he didnt have money for a taxi (It would take him at least an hour to walk). We had talked a lot that evening and i was so happy for the understanding that he gave me and i offered him to stay at the guest room at my apartment (i live alone and really close to where the party was). I think he felt weird about it at first but i said that it’s fine it was just a nice gesture right?
Well we walked to my place and yeah well we had sex (it just happened). We slept for 4 hours and had morning sex. He was so amazing and we had such a great time. He really seemed to like me and i felt like i had known him for ages. I drove him home in the around 1 pm because i was going to the same neihborhood anyways. 

Now i feel weird. He said he was going to text me? Okay great? But he hasn’t- its been 2 days ( i know it’s not a lot) but i feel like we are in a really weird situation. I don’t know what i was thinking. This is so weird and overwhelming and I’m so confused.

Should i just stop worrying about him? Is he freaked out about this? I dont know what advise you can give me because there isn’t one to give right?

I think that’s probably the worst option.I could go around her and just tell her family ,that’s what I want to do but I know it’s probably not what’s best.What I’ve been doing so far is encouraging her to consider telling her mom ,but as of now she’s not going to do that,she said she would talk to her little sister about it because she may have been a victim too considering they lived in the same house at the time but she hasn’t done it yet.If someone could give me some insight on this and where to go from here I’d appreciate it.",rape,I need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lkfjmg/i_need_advice/,1613373093.0

224,catkino,1613351800,"I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to do here. There's a guy from work who I always thought was a little off-putting, always talking about girls and sex despite never having girlfriends and whatever. I always thought it was innocuous, like Jay from the inbetweeners or something. For secret santa last year, he got gifted a blow up doll, which I'm only bringing up because it shows you how well known this trait of his is and how we all kind of treat it like a joke.

Anyway, we have an alright relationship outside of work. I'm not really social at all but this guy just didn't leave me alone and eventually we became friends in a way. Recently, he was talking about a girl he is snapchatting. He said she's a wreck because of a relationship that didn't work out with another guy who worked here before I started. He then confessed to having raped her while she was drunk and unconscious. It wasn't really a confession, he told it like it was just a funny story. He said she still didn't know it happened.

I asked him if he knew that was rape, he gave some non answers and it became obvious he realised how badly he fucked up by telling someone this. I kept pressing him on it and eventually he said something like ""I do kinda feel bad because she doesn't know"" or something.

He's a foreigner here on a visa and the only thing saving him is that I know he's such a liar that in his spastic little head, this was a good way to make up a story that proves he's not a virgin and that he can't get called out on because even the girl doesn't know it happened. Maybe it sounds like this guy is 15 or something but he is 23.

The victim is a real girl however, I don't know her at all, never met her but she exists unlike most of the girls he knows. I have no idea what to do, because if it's true, I'm genuinely worried about this guy. It puts everything into a whole new context.

For example, there was a 14 year old girl who would come in on weekends and this guy would drop her off home after work. The girl blocked him on instagram for being a ""creep"", we all thought it was funny that he even followed her on Insta and figured that him finding her on there was why it was creepy, but now, who the fuck knows, there may have been something else going on.

So what do I even do here? If I go to the police or something, I'd be putting the victim through that too and she doesn't even know it happened.

I knew he would eventually ask as I could tell it turned him on but had sincerely hoped he wouldn’t and that I would be strong enough to say no.

It was worse than I imagined. I thought I could handle it but I feel sick to my stomach.

Over the past few months he’s gotten all the details and made me act it out exactly, even asking me to use a “kid voice” when I spoke.

He “raped” and choked me all while demanding I tell him it hurt and beg him to stop in a child’s voice. 

I’ve never seen him cum so hard or look so pleased. I’ve also never been more disgusted in my life.

Some people here warned me he would escalate and I chose to hold onto hope that he wouldn’t.

I really like this guy but will be ending the relationship as I can’t vibe with a guy who gets off to the abuse of a child.

I realized too late he removed the condom and his excuse was to make it authentic.

I realize I’m at fault for playing along but I was trying to not kink shame. I now know this is simply not something I can watch him enjoy

Or those of us stressed by the societal expectation to have sex and whether our experiences will ruin the night for both parties. Or those of us who yearn for comfort and don't know how to get that.

You are not alone. We are here. We will listen and support you. You have value and in having survived, possess strength as well.

To those of us who have recovered the ability to enjoy romantic relationships:

Congratulations! I am so proud of how far you've come. You deserve to enioy your loved ones in your life. I hope you cherish it. I know you've put in a lot of hard work to get to this point. I also recognize the journey continues for a lot of us well after we recover our desire for romantic relationships. 

Lastly, to those of you in active abuse... I hope it ends and your healing begins immediately. Whether or not you decide to report makes you no less a victim. You deserve to have your body respected. We will be here to try and direct you to resources as best we can. To provide insight on how legal processes can play out. To listen to your truth...

231,La_Bufanda_Billy,1613326505,"(At the end, there will be a summary for people who don’t want to read the great wall of text.)

This all started with my earliest memory. I was probably 2 or 3 years old, when my babysitter convinced me she was my biological mother (I wasn’t allowed to see pictures of my biological mother until I was a teenager) and forced me to get naked for her while she pretended to breastfeed me - making me lick her nipples and breast while she explained that’s what mothers do and she was my mother. She also touched me in places she shouldn’t have (I don’t really like being specific about this) and was put on a trial, but never arrested or given any punishment beyond being told to stop babysitting. My father thought it was disgusting at least, but my legal mother (who will be important later) refused to condone it at all.

The most traumatic experience was more a collection of experiences from the time I was about 4 to when I was about 8. During this time, my aforementioned legal mother would give me “genital exams” a few times a week. She claimed this was for medical reasons, but it was not. She was a horrible mother in general, and was very abusive to my father before divorcing him when I was 5, and never willingly stopped her abuse towards me (although we don’t talk anymore). This sick monster was/is not a doctor, and hasn’t even had a job for over 20 years - so she definitely wasn’t qualified to be doing this, even with good intentions. I could honestly write a book about how horrible she was, as she did downright crazy things like keeping a journal of when I went to the bathroom and exactly how much I ate, collected my teeth/hair/blood (yes, my blood, I told you she was crazy!), and attempted to set up security cameras in my room. I reported her to the authorities quite a few times, but nothing was ever really done about it. She convinced those at school that I was autistic and “making up the symptoms” of abuse. I’m not autistic, as I was actually tested when I was 12 and the results confirmed that. My dad also used this whole ordeal as an excuse to make strange sexual comments towards me. He never did anything besides being too handsy with me, so I don’t even care that much anymore.

Lastly, and most recently was about a year ago (right before my country started taking COVID-19 seriously) when I was on a ski trip and a man my girlfriend and I had been skiing with randomly decided that he wanted to be alone with me on the bus, and without any sort of consent just shoves his tongue deep into my throat. He wanted me to give him a blowjob, and had expressed this in the past, but I managed to leave (I’m very short, yet I also have 6 years of martial arts training, so he probably didn’t suspect me to have the strength to get away from him) before he tried anything else.

All being said, I feel really lost and I’m that scared this or something simular is going to happen again. I have PTSD from these experiences (no surprise there), and a great deal of anxiety surrounding anything related to authority, as it’s always those with power over me who took advantage of me. I also don’t understand what was so appealing about me as a child. I’ve always dressed modestly, I don’t drink (and I definitely didn’t as a kid), I didn’t act like a loli or anything, and I’ve never done anything to suggest I wanted this to happen! My childhood was ruined by all this and even now I feel like I’m not living life properly. My best friend has been telling me for so long that it’ll get better, but it hasn’t. And honestly, even though I don’t feel much anymore (I haven’t in over a decade by now) I do feel a sense of despair that things won’t get better. And if they don’t? I’ve never had a close relationship with life anyway. I feel completely comfortable trying to end it again when things truly get hopeless. Then again, I’ve had this mindset since I was 7, so who knows when that will be. 

Anyway, to summarise: I’ve been raped by more than one person more times than I even bother trying to count - most of which were my own (non biological) mother. It’s given me more issues than I probably realise, and is the reason I’ve wanted (and actively tried) to die since I was 6. None of what I’ve tried works, and I’ve just about lost hope.",rape,What hope is left in a society where this was allowed to happen: (rant),https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/ljtt3z/what_hope_is_left_in_a_society_where_this_was/,1613297705.0

239,Illustrious_Two_5055,1613280747,"Hey guys, 

I’m just posting this because I need a place to get out my feelings. I feel like I’m having a panic attack right now. Yesterday, I went out with my friends to this drinking place. We all had a good time, and maybe after about 4 hours, we were all incredibly drunk. A friend I have a crush on left a little bit earlier then the rest of us, and I honestly wish I had left too because a little bit later, some guys came and sat down next to us. My world was already spinning and I was ready to go home but my friends still wanted to stay. So these guys start talking to us, my friends got up to dance and I was just sitting at the table, drunk, and this guy was trying to talk to me and kept touching me. He continuously put his hand in my skirt and underwear. And touching my chest. And groping my legs and under my underwear too.  I live in Korea, so maybe he was pretending he couldn’t understand me. But I told him in English and Korean multiple times to not do that and that it wasn’t okay, and I kept pulling his hand out of my skirt. He apologized the first time, and I thought it would stop but it just continually kept happening. Even though I already told him to stop so many times.

I don’t know why I’m posting this but I just feel really gross right now. I know going out, this is just what women have to deal with. I’m 24 and these situations have happened to me enough that I should know what to expect when I go out, but I’m just so exhausted of having to deal with this. I woke up today and still felt like his hands were all over me, and I can’t tell if I’m making too big of a deal out of this. I want to talk to someone but I feel like it’s not a big deal. I’ve been raped before, so I’m not saying this is the same, so I don’t know why I’m reacting like this. 

I usually talk out my feelings with my roommate but I feel like I can’t talk to her right now. I always drop my assault trauma on her, and the amount of times these things have happened, I feel like I’m crying wolf. Like how many assualt stories can one person have?! I’m upset with myself for always letting this happen. Instead of getting up and walking away, I always allow myself to be put in these situations. Even yesterday, I felt like I was being strong with my no, usually I don’t tell people strongly, and it still didn’t matter. 

I also feel like I can’t talk to my roommate right now, because she’s on the phone with her bf explaining how some guy came up to her and grabbed her butt yesterday, but after she said no, he left. I feel like everything is always about me, so I don’t want to make my situation seem as bad.

245,trashytrashaccount10,1613269634,"I feel like I'm being dramatic and that these situations are definitely partially my fault because I could've been more assertive and not allowed myself to be taken advantage of, but I'm not sure if/how much the guys have been at fault. Sorry if this is overdramatic. TIA!

Guy #1:

* numerous times before we met up I said I wouldn't have sex - even before I drove over I told him and he replied ""yeah okay""
* I said no and stopped him from taking my clothes off at first
* gave in (partly because I was inexperienced - I was a virgin, never spent the night with a guy; he was more experienced and 3 years older)
* He would tell me to relax so it would hurt less and that it was more awkward because I was silent
* After it happened he left me alone for hours until around 3 am
* I saw him 3 or 4 more times after (only sorta hooked up one of those times) and he'd take forever to reply unless it was about sex &amp; said I was mean if I didn't want to hookup
* He also lied about being tested

Guy #2:

* FWB, I'm in an open relationship
* I said no but he kept trying to take my clothes off despite me kicking him off/trying to sleep (not extremely rough or anything)
* Other times I end up giving in so I don't have to be pestered
* Will still hook up even if he knows I'm not enjoying it
* I think he used to view it as more playful than serious because he'd ask if certain things were okay for him to do, but now I think it comes from being selfish",rape,Am I overreacting?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/ljf9ti/am_i_overreacting/,1613240834.0
246,rosedelvign,1613266262,"This belongs more on a sexual assault thread but Ive already posted it twice on one and got no responses. Im just looking for an outside opinion because Idk if something happened to me or if I was just on too many drugs &amp; it was my own fault. Sorry in advance this will be long im describing 3 different events that took place within 48 hours. Keep in mind I was 16 when this happened &amp; I was already going through a lot of emotional turmoil due to other things going on in my life, I was using semi-heavy drugs on a daily basis &amp; was pretty heavily intoxicated during all these incidents. Im going to be as brutally honest &amp; unbiased as I can be. It started off with me &amp; my friend going out of state to stay at this house overnight with this guy she was talking to &amp; everyone else that lived there. Within probably the first 20 minutes of being there I was walking out from the bathroom &amp; this guy I’ll call J (who was 20) had me come sit with him alone &amp; was trying to get me to give him a bj. I  remember telling him im too fucked up, he kept saying “So ?” after a few minutes of this my friend walked in the room and I was fine. Later that night (by now im off a bar of xanax, tramadol &amp; had just smoked weed &amp; theyre all in full effect) I don’t know how but I had ended up back alone with him &amp; he was even more persistent, I kept telling him no &amp; I remember even telling him ‘lets just fuck’ (I really just didnt want to give a BJ I never had before) after like 20 minutes of this I remember him asking me me to ‘just lick it’ &amp; being that intoxicated &amp; worn down I thought fine &amp; went to what I thought would just be me ‘licking it’ (ew lol) once, instead he grabbed my head and Im sure you can imagine what happened. The next day it was new years eve &amp; I was back at my house with the friend I had gone up there with &amp; she was telling me they wanted us to come back up there for a new years party tonight, I really didnt want to &amp; told my friend what had happened but she kept telling me itd be fine &amp; we’d have fun so I reluctantly agreed because I didnt want to be alone on new years or leave her alone up there. I went up there that night with the intention of staying away from J. While I was there I met this guy i’ll call A (18 years old) &amp; remember liking him at first, we has smoked &amp; were drinking (I was off xanax &amp; lean too), he kept passing me bottles trying to get me to drink more. He started making advances at me, he tried to finger me, tried to get me to do things to him multiple times &amp; I kept telling him no &amp; he would apologize everytime &amp; say hes just really drunk. I got really turned off by it &amp; ended up leaving him with the intention of going to the bathroom to change my clothes &amp; then go to sleep. I was in the bathroom &amp; he kept knocking on the door trying to get me to let him in, (my memory gets really hazy here) i guess I let him in, im pretty sure he told me he had to go to the bathroom and I was gonna let him. Next thing I remember is being on the floor in the bathroom, him trying to get me to suck his dick &amp; me saying I cant, then him picking me up and having sex with me then probably like 30 seconds in him stopping and telling me theres blood. I hadnt told him to stop or not to having sex with me as far as I can remember. I had started bleeding pretty bad (I wasnt on my period) &amp; spent the next few minutes cleaning it off the floor. Next thing I remember Im on a couch kissing A in a room in the dark. This girl comes in &amp; tells us we cant be in there so we walk into the other room where everyone else was &amp; as Im coming through the door walking into the room that girl smacks me &amp; starts calling me a hoe, we got pulled apart &amp; I spend the next few hours sitting alone because the girl I had came there with was passed out &amp; nobody was talking to me after all that. I texted everyone I knew with a car seeing if someone could come get me but nobody could. Later that night after everyone was asleep J comes over to me gives me a drink and tells me he had told her to hit me &amp; it was his fault &amp; hes sorry, Next thing I remember Im giving him a BJ. I dont remember how it ended up happening that time &amp; if it was the same as the night before or if it was completely consentual, i really don’t know. I went home the next day &amp; I had brusises all over my body &amp; felt so disgusted with myself, I thought I was just a hoe and the whole thing was my fault, and it mightve been i dont know. I ended up hearing from this girl I went to school with that J had tried to push her head &amp; force her to give him oral, but she had gotten him off her, i know he had been involved with a few other girls that were my age (highschool girls) too even though hes 20. Ive never seen, heard from, or heard about A since that night. Its been a little over a year and I have been thinking about it recently &amp; I still do think most of this was my fault but Im not sure.

250,eggsricehotsauce,1613242217,"Hi everyone. First of all, I want to start off by saying this is one of the roughest situations I've ever been in, because my friend came out with a story that is exactly similar to my own.

I have a friend- lets call her Jamie. Jamie is best friends with Lisa. They've been best friends for 7 years now, and I love them both. Jamie and I have been really close for the past few years, and I've grown to love them as a person. Lisa and I had a fling a few years back, so we aren't close anymore, but have recently built up a friendship.

As Lisa and I started to get closer, I started noticing them talking bad about Jamie and being mean to her. I wasn't really comfortable with this, as Jamie is one of my closest friends, so I confronted Lisa about it. Lisa told me there's more to this than I know, and confided in me about something that happened years ago.

According to Lisa, Jamie got her really drunk one night, and they had a threesome with Jamie's ex boyfriend who lived with Jamie. She feels like this was a rape, because Jamie should've known that she would've never been interested in having sex with either one of them sober.

According to Jamie, she was ALSO drunk, and they BOTH woke up her ex together with this idea.

Now a little about me :

I had a best friend in high school who was supposedly drunk, and sexually took advantage of me while I was black out drunk. Just like Lisa, I'm a super horny drunk, so I'm capable of making mistakes if someone allows me to, or leads me to it. This stands as the most traumatizing event of my life, so I'm very sensitive to this subject.

Lisa and Jamie have drunkenly made out many times before, but Lisa is in no way shape or form attracted to Jamie. I told Lisa that she needs to tell Jamie about this, because this is unhealthy and it's unhealthy to keep this fake friendship that hurts Jamie so much and triggers her so much.

Long story short, Lisa confronted Jamie, and now hates her. She cut her off from everything, all social media etc- they're no longer friends. Lisa didn't even give Jamie a chance to process.

Understandably, Jamie was taken aback and is dealing with the new information that the person she thought was her best friend has actually been feeling abused by her this whole time, and thinks she's a rapist.

Jamie acted correctly, in my opinion. She did not reach out to Lisa. She did not make excuses for herself. She was disappointed in herself, and not invalidating Lisa at all. Even though she was also very drunk and feels like they spoke about it  as a drunken mistake in the past, she's not going to invalidate Lisa's feelings. She also agreed to never show up in any of Lisa's spaces, ever. She said she was going to try to be sober, since alcohol is the problem- but unfortunately, she hasn't been sober.....

Lisa is watching Jamie on social media (even though I told her not to do that to herself) and seeing how happy Jamie is and her rage is getting deeper.

She now wants to ruin Jamie's life. She wants to expose Jamie for being a rapist, and she wants her to have NOTHING. She doesn't care if Jamie dies.

It's hard for me, because even though I have been seriously distant from Jamie since all of this, I still care for Jamie deeply and feel like she isn't a bad person. I feel like she's made stupid mistakes, and that she has a drinking problem. She has a lot of work to do, and I want to help her do the work.

But Lisa is angry. Lisa is literally not going to stop until Jamie's life is ruined. I'm honestly scared that Jamie is going to kill herself, and Im scared it's all my fault for making Lisa recognize her feelings (there's more to this that I'm leaving out).

I have no idea what to do, because I want to support Lisa 100%, but I don't fully support cancel culture and I also don't believe in ruining peoples lives. I know Lisa is traumatized and deserves healing, but I don't think breaking Jamie down is the right thing to do. When I even briefly hinted at that, Lisa attacked me and I'm scared for my own well being at this point because I don't want to be exposed as a rape apologist either.

But I wish I could give Jamie a heads up. I wish I can tell her to talk to her boyfriend about it, before Lisa does, so that she has the upper hand, but I'm scared this will be messy.

I'm really torn, and I feel guilty and I feel scared and I'm taking on all of this emotional stress because I'm scared for my friend.

Any advice? You can be hard on me, too, by the way. I'm a very sensitive person and I'm also a Libra so I tend to see both sides, but I don't want to be a rape apologist. Especially because I know how much it  would kill me if I told my friends about what happened to me and they still decided to hang out with him.",rape,Am I a rape apologist?

251,No-Acanthisitta-5371,1613240195,"Hi, this is my first time posting here.
And as the title says, yes, as of now I don't know if I am virgin or not. And yes as far as I know, I was raped, since was 6 years old. I am 20 F, and as I was exploring myself, I cant seem to find my vagina like there isn't hole in there. I know that it is near the anal hole but my finger couldn't really go inside. As for my rape experiences, as far as I remember, (my first rapist is the same age as me, guided by someone older) I just remember that he was on top of me, I dont really remember if he put it inside. And for the second one (most recent was 2015), I am sleeping (Im a heavy sleeper) when he is touching me and when I feel that I instantly go up from bed so Im also not sure. 

Aside from my rape experiences, I have no other sexual (even romantic) relationships. It is due to the fact that I am ashamed of being raped and really haven't opened up to anyone about this.

To prepare myself for any future relationships, I want to accept and explore myself first. So, I just wanna know if vagina closes or something when it isn't touched for years. If I find it hard to put my finger in, do I need to force it or something? What should I do to be comfortable with it?",rape,Am I still a virgin????,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/lj5uis/am_i_still_a_virgin/,1613211395.0
