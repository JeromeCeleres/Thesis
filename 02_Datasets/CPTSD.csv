I’m new to all of this, I’m only 19 and started exploring my CPTSD recently since I got a therapist and I had a conversation with my mom which flared up a lot of old wounds but what I noticed the most is that I started being so afraid of the dark and sleeping alone, just like when I was a child. I haven’t had problems sleeping at night since I was like 7? I grew out of my fear of the dark relatively fast to other children and now I was even considering leaving my room and sleeping in the living room because I kept seeing things and felt unsafe.

So yeah just like the title says I can't make friends. I God honestly don't trust people. I've had 4 stalkers in my life. One found me from online, broke into my home when I was a teenager and tried to kill me and my mom. My hero cat freaked out and woke us up thank God. He was less than 10 feet from me hiding on my porch. (I fell asleep on the couch) 

I've had to travel a lot through Greyhound bus trying to get across the country. I grew up in the deep South in North America so I did everything I could to get out of there. The Greyhound exspirence did not help with my trust not did living in the deep South. I'm trans so I didn't belong anywhere. 

I finally made it to the PNW. I thought this was the promise land. I'm safe...then I got stalked at work this time. I tried to reach out and build a support network but...I'm not trans enough and I'm not straight passing....I don't want to be something I'm not to fit in. 

I used to go to Raves a lot. So I could be around people and have great moments but I did it without a mask so people started to recognize me and make a big deal about seeing me. I got excited, happy but the first time I invited these ""friends"" over they come late like 11pm after I invited them for dinner (on my birthday) they brought a plushie (kinda nice) they were clearly fucked up. They woke up my older roommates when they pilled into the only bathroom upstairs to snort something (I assume coke or ket) then come out all crazy. I tell them they have to go and they left there drug straws and mess all over my bathroom. And every other time I try something like that happens. 

They make me feel important then use me. After I called people out I have been shunned. I was make decent money modeling but now all my pics are flagged. I used to get their ""fake support"" now they go out of their was to ignore me because I won't give them anything and called them out.

No one cares that I have been through every form of abuse and I have walls that need time to break down. 
Omg what kills me more is they keep being like ""I've so mentally abused I'm crazy but I'll never change"" 
I hate that so much...

I get so upset over people knowing my personal info I can't breath and I freakout, not be a c**t to a guy because you can't be alone with your thoughts. 

I'm sorry I wanted to express how I can't make friends and it turned into a rant. I'm sorry please excuse me. I don't know if I will reply very much but I read everything. I don't want to to think you did something wrong...I just get to scared to reply. 


I'm afraid of giving anymore info than I already have lest some one comes at me for complaining about them...my ""friends"" already tried to cancel me because I didn't hate something they did...

2,Dragonair_fruit1371,1614191292,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low due to some family incident. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

7,3s5e_throwaway,1614189362,"Let me preface this by saying that I don’t consider myself an incel, primarily because the things they believe about women and do to women are quite abhorrent. I would, however, consider myself a type of ""volcel"", and I’m looking for a bit of support. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship, although I have lost my virginity to a sexual surrogate. Relationships and social connection in general, including platonic friendships, have always been difficult for me.

In middle school, I dealt with some pretty nasty ostracism and bullying which still affects me to this day. It’s only in the last couple of years that I’ve come to realize that what I went through was complex trauma and that what I’ve been feeling since then is shame. All I knew for the years in between was that I despised myself. Over the years, that shame has slowly ingrained itself into my psyche to the point that it can’t be removed. It’s a fundamental part of me now and I’ve come to embrace it. I’ve stopped fighting against it and I’ve come to believe that the things it tells me are true.

Women deal with a lot of terrible things, both as individuals and as a group. I’d consider myself relatively woke and socially conscious. I can’t list all the ways women suffer at the hands of men, but they include the wage gap, unrealistic beauty standards, sexual violence, domestic violence, restrictions on reproductive health, and sexual harassment - just to name a few. Women have been put through hell for millennia, and they’re exhausted. Even just the last four years under Trump have been brutal for them.

The way I see it, women deal with so much shit in their lives because of men. They shouldn’t have to deal with me. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t harass women or abuse them, and I think that men who do are trash. I’m fully supportive of feminism, doing away with the wage gap, full reproductive freedom for women, holding abusers and predators accountable, and so on. I think I’m a decent person. However, I’ve come to accept as true some of the things that my shame has told me - I’m simply not good enough and women deserve better than me. Simply put, I’ve come to believe that, no matter what I do, I’m a low-value male (LVM).

To be honest, I personally think I'm decent looking, that I don't have a bad personality, and that I at least somewhat have my shit together. I'm not perfect, but I think I could be a lot worse in a lot of ways. Regardless, I still think that I'm objectively an LVM.

Those beliefs used to cause me a lot of pain, but after a while, I stopped struggling against them and came to embrace them. As Steve Carell’s character in *The Forty Year Old Virgin* says, “I respect women so much, I completely stay away from them”. I refrain from seeking out romance and sex with women as a form of respect. They already deal with enough shit in their day-to-day lives. They shouldn’t have to deal with LVM’s like me. I can best respect them by not wasting their time or making them deal with me. They deserve better than me.

Don’t get me wrong, I still have female friends and coworkers, and I consider my relationships with them to be pretty solid and respectful. Also, don’t get me wrong - I still feel lonely and want romance and sex with women. But I’ve come to realize that respecting women is more important than dating them.

I’ll be honest. Living life this way can be tough. There is loneliness and pain associated with it. Any advice on how I can deal with that loneliness and pain? Is there any way that I can at least get some sort of validation for my decision?",CPTSD,"I stay away from women out of respect, but the loneliness also gets to me",https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lriyna/i_stay_away_from_women_out_of_respect_but_the/,1614160562.0

Its  so hard to completely take care of myself being so depressed, these people dont get it. it was my mistake in opening up to my friend about my looks, i just got backhanded compliments and insults. I admit i have a hard time taking care of my hair because its too much hair an on the curly side. Honestly i reached out to my friend because i was so depressed about being bullied over my appearance the past years and what she said made me feel worse.

Clothes? i dont care about clothes much, im not into fashion much. i dress fine. Jeans and shirts/blouses. My hair is a different story its so hard to manage because its very thick, frizzy, poofy ( I just hate it being pointed out to me!! Because now this created a new insecurity in me! Why is my self worth determined by what i wear? my friend is a fashionista so guess it make sense but still she cant wait to watch me take care of my hair and see my fashion choices?? I wrote to her how rude and tactless that was and told her how could she even thought that was okay to say to someone like me? she also brought up my other past experiences of other people telling me bad things about how i look and how it shaped me into who i am, i did not like my past experience brought up by her. She also told me that the friend and family who told me i had potential to unleash was trying to give a compliment, potential is not a compliment. I It says i dont look good right now. i havent heard back from her lol. This is why i wear hats and hoodies and cover myself as much as i can, so people wont say anything.

She tells me the generic advice ""ugly people dont exist!(yes they do) everyone is beautiful (no)you are beautiful! (no) ""Keep taking care of yourself, cry until if you have to until there is no tears left... i cant wait to see what fashion choices you will have once you get a job , your shoes, turn your trauma and take it out on your body, you have to express yourself , turn your self into a goddess you are, dress with a see you take care of your hair, dress with purpose, eat with a purpose, oil yourself, put a hair mask (I can't oil my trauma away!) and i cant wait to see your house decorations and the day i get to watch you take care of your hair "".  as im too poor to afford self care and to look attractive, alright. You dont see me telling you to try a weight loss program for self love now do i?

Everything she said seemed so backhanded, i think deep down she knew this because she said i hope i didn't offend you and i adore. Yeah ok. the hair comment got me, because i always been bullied over my  very curly hair so its very hard to take care of and looks messy a lot of the time. Depression makes everything hard to do. I been bullied for my hair a lot in my life, anyone mentioning my hair is VERY sensitive topic for me. These people dont understand, they are always called beautiful unlike me



Im TRYING!!! It hurts me when people think i dont. im looking for the right products, i have a very THICK hair, i have lots of it and i barely have any energy thats why taking care of it so HARD. If it was straight and flatter it would be a lot easier to take care of myself slowly but these comments make me lose motivation for some reason. Its hard being naturally ugly.

10,murphysbutterchurner,1614189084,"When I was 19 I befriended this guy who had just gotten out of the military. He was 27 and we got along pretty well. I have no idea if he was interested in me but he seemed to really want to spend time with me, which put me off. (I've always had a tendency to gravitate towards people who make me ""earn"" whatever affection they give me.) Anyway, because I was 19 and a rude emotionally stunted idiot I ghosted him. I still wonder how he's doing, and if he was ever able to work his issues out. I have no way of contacting him now, but I genuinely hope he's doing well. 

Fast forward to a blind date I let myself get pressured into when I was 25. A friend of mine was seeing  this guy and she was falling for him really quickly. He had this friend who was having trouble getting a girl, and asked if she knew anyone who might be on his level. I was the only friend she had who was as big a loser as this guy, so she pressured me pretty hard to just give him a chance and I caved because I knew she was trying to impress her boyfriend and I wanted to help her out. 

At the date, well. It was awful, and not just because I despise dating. He was quiet and sulky and we had nothing to say to each other. I tried asking him about himself and it was like pulling teeth. I was not attracted to him in the slightest. 

The other two kept telling me what a great guy he was and I just needed to give him time to open up, because god knows I'm slow to warm up and he's extending the same courtesy to me. (Spoiler alert, he had zero interest in me as anything other than a set of orifices. He wasn't extending me any kind of courtesy, lol.) But my friend said, ""You're frustrated and depressed because you never go outside your comfort zone. This is a way to do that. You're just afraid to grow."" And I guess I thought she was right. I had been single my whole life, and assumed I was just afraid.

I told myself to go along with it because I genuinely couldn't -- and still can't -- tell if I'm just being hypervigilant and numb or if there's actually something my gut is trying to tell me. For all I know, the guy I met when I was 19 could've been amazing and I pushed him away for absolutely no good reason. 

So I made myself go along with this guy, and what do you know, he was a controlling narcissist and a rapist who got off on pinning me down and telling me he would make me a mother...just generally a piece of garbage all around. I'm trash myself, but even I have to draw the line, lol. 

And nowadays I'm very strict about keeping to myself. Even if I weren't high risk for COVID, I wouldn't be able to date. But I know if I did come across someone who, for whatever reason, took an interest in me, I would have the same problem. I would feel absolutely nothing for them, or put off by them, and I would make myself go ahead anyway, because how do I know it isn't just me being hypervigilant and afraid to be vulnerable? How do I know when I have no magnetic north for this kind of shit? 

Every relationship I witnessed growing up was abusive, so I'm steeped in the whole ""real relationships are work"" thing, where ""work"" means pushing a boulder up a hill and then letting it steamroll over you again and again on its way back down to the ground. Anything else seems...superficial, somehow. Like, if you don't despise each other it's only because you don't know each other that well. 

Plus, I'm ordinary. In my family, being ordinary is something to be punished. Especially if the person doing the punishing has, for whatever reason, decided to be charitable and get into a relationship with you.

I’ve come to realize I dislike being liked and building deep connections. As someone gets closer to me I feel the most vulnerable cause they’ll eventually find out who I really am. Nasty, evil and hurtful. It seems they have such a greater power to destroy me by letting me down that I’m always ready for disappointment and finding myself overanalyzing their every behavior. It fills me with paranoia because won’t allow anyone to betray or hurt me.

And I know that’s mostly paranoia talking. My psychologist told me once that “people are not your mother and not everyone is out there to get you” because I project the mother-daughter dynamic onto everyone.

Yesterday I thought a good friend (and one of the only I have left) was hitting on the guy I’m into and I said terrible things to her, horrible things. She said she could hear the rage in my voice. Even before she answered me I regretted what I had done and started to cry. It was my trigger talking, just 5 minutes of pure desperation and anger that seemed like the Chernobyl Disaster, irreparable damage. I was immediately sent back to middle school and to all the times my friends purposely hit on the boys I liked, which always made me feel awful and triggered my eating disorder and body dysmorphia back then because I needed to be perfect and thin and beautiful otherwise I’d keep losing. I carry both disorders to this day. 

It was so unfair, it was MY trigger and MY responsibility to deal with it, there was no way she could’ve known she was stepping into a no-go zone and even if she did know, she wasn’t doing anything wrong, she didn’t want to hurt me. Now there’s one more person walking on eggshells around me and one more person I will eventually leave because the shame is unbearable and I don’t want to hurt her any further.

14,staaahhhp,1614188423,"I'm trying to remember that this is just the way it goes. There are ups and downs. You make progress, then lose some ground. But this time it really hurts. 2020 was actually a good year for my recovery. I had a perfect excuse to stay home and not socialize! I meditated a lot. My mind settled down. I did great at work, taking on new responsibilities. I struggled, of course, but there was an upward momentum that was undeniable. All my life I've had repeated emotional flashbacks, but since mid last year, I had almost none. I was anxious, of course, but I didn't have the complete meltdowns that I used to have so often. I felt like I was actually recovering.

Then two months ago I started working longer hours to meet a deadline and didn't take enough time off to recover. Over a few weeks I kept getting more and more tense. I had constant insomnia. My IBS flared up and I was in constant pain. I was getting resentful about my company putting so much pressure on me. Then three weeks ago, my 86 year old mom tested positive for COVID. I immediately thought, this is it, she's going to die. (I love my mom. My dad was the abuser. She made a lot of mistakes, but she tried to be a decent person. She's fine now, by the way.) 

Then shit blew up at work and I completely came apart. My mind was spiraling out of control. About a year ago, I had told my manager that I had CPTSD, as a kind of warning, so he wouldn't be totally surprised if I was having trouble. I don't think he understood, though. When I started falling apart this time, I messaged him and another manager and said I was freaking out and can't take the pressure. They tried to be sympathetic, but of course, no one can possibly understand. I ended up yelling at one of them, berating him for how he treated me.  I feel so ashamed for that now.  

At first, I felt good that I was able to be honest about what I'm going through. Sometimes the worst part of an episode like this is the shame, feeling like you have to keep acting like everything is ok, when things are really falling apart. It felt good to just say, ""FYI, I'm completely out of my fucking mind, so can you cut me some slack for a little while?"" But then the shame returned. I'm so embarrassed that now they know what a damaged person I am. I have to talk to them every day and now they KNOW MY SECRET. Ugh. 

Then I had another emotional flashback. I spent another few days spiraling. I felt humiliated by people at work. I was paranoid, thinking that this one guy was intentionally torturing me, and that one of my friends hated me. I've been oscillating between anxiety, terror, rage and dissociation, over and over. It's fucking hell. 

Today, it feels like my mind is settling down into plain old depression and despair. Everything is dead. My mind is blank. I look at the work I have to do and I can't make sense of it. I can't think straight. How can I do my job? How can I pay my mortgage? I still have six months of tight deadlines to get through and I'm falling apart already. I can't do this.

20,NotableMatches,1614186319,"I don't quite remember the first time I heard about the concept of ""talking to your inner child"", this idea of searching for a neglected, scared child inside oneself and reassuring them that one will care for them. Perhaps it was here in this subreddit, perhaps it was in one of the books I read about CPTSD. What I remember, though, is that I thought it was pseudoscientific drivel. Surely there's no way I can have some kind of breakthrough in my healing journey by doing something as silly as talking to memories of myself. The whole thing sounded like wishful thinking and, at worst, emotional snake oil to desperate folks who had tried most everything else they could. I'm very scientific-minded, not one to entertain magical thinking, so looking for an unspecified, unfalsifiable ""inner child"" didn't sit well with me.

I also thought it patronizing to assume that every traumatized person had ""a child"" of sorts inside them, as if having trauma precludes one from being a proper adult. I have a job. I pay rent. I do taxes. I distanced myself from toxic family members. I cook healthy food every day, I sleep at a reasonable hour and I exercise. I've done years of cognitive behavioural therapy. Methinks I'm doing pretty nicely at being an adult, so why would I listen to some nonsense about ""speaking to your inner child""? I'm not a child anymore, I'm a sizeable burly bloke with responsibilities and no one to help me with them, and that means my time would clearly be best spent elsewhere.

Well then. I learned about ""speaking to an inner child"" conceptually but never gave the idea much credit, and life went on. I kept reading about CPTSD and trauma in general, most recently reaching the tail end of The Body Keeps the Score, where van der Kolk discusses other shifty-sounding healing methods like yoga and IFS. After a chapter on psychomotor therapy (how outlandish!), which I read at work on my idle time, I came back home yesterday and did my usual evening routine.

At the end of the night, I decided to do something I hadn't done in a while: meditating. Sure, I have a habit of turning the lights off and talking about the day's events to my cell phone's audio recorder, but rarely do I ever just sit with myself and *feel* things. There was a time when I meditated daily, and I felt myself the better for it, so I'm intending to pick up this habit again whenever my schedule allows it. Last night, I put in my earplugs and sat in the dark, in silence, minding my breathing and letting whatever sprouting thoughts pass me by.

I don't know how it happened. I must leave blank a part of the story, because I really cannot describe how my mind went there, but I ended up seeing myself from the past. Perhaps the reason why the ""inner child"" thing never resonated with me is because my inner child isn't a child. Rather, he must be between sixteen and eighteen years old, the period in my life where things really went tits up for me. Life was bad before that, but not as bad as when I was just dipping my toes in adult life. So there he was, and I saw him, laying in his bed as he did all day, wearing his horrid old work uniform, playing video games to escape his abysmal family life, fat and unkempt and perpetually tired.

And then, I don't know what sort of spell took hold of me, something unlike anything I've previously experienced in meditation sessions. Silently, speaking with my mind's voice, I started to affirm positive things to my young self. *""You deserve to have needs. You deserve to have desires. You deserve to love and feel loved. You deserve social support from a community. You deserve to be accepted for who you are.""* An unexpected explosion of wholesomeness - uncharacteristic because I don't tend to talk like that to anyone, uncharacteristic because no one tends to talk like that to me. My teenage self most certainly wasn't accustomed to this much gratuitous, saccharine affection.

Accompanying this scene came a feeling on my body - oh what a rare thing, to feel my emotions physically! - a feeling of pure bliss emanating from my lower spine, radiating down my thighs and up my back. It's much stronger than an orgasm, and I can only feel it when I'm listening intently to music or when I'm meditating. I don't think I ever felt it as strongly as last night.

And then my tone changed from this wholesome joy and into a grave sadness which resulted from seeing, very clearly, that my young self did not have all the good things he deserved. *""You do not deserve to be insulted. You do not deserve to be manipulated. You do not deserve to be mocked. You do not deserve to be lonely.""* I was blurting out a kind of Bill of Rights to my young self, to really highlight the fact that it was not OK to live like he did, to suffer like he did, to be treated like he was. I wanted him to know, this young adult who could see no viable future from his vantage point, that the world was larger than his stuffy room and his dysfunctional family. That he could become more than he ever thought possible.

The floodgates opened when I hugged him in my mind's eye, and told him everything would be alright. *""I got you, bro. I'm here for you now. I will take care of you. You're important to me. Together, we'll get you all the things you need. Together, we'll do wonderful things. There are pains I still carry, there are problems I still can't solve, and for that I'm so sorry. But you have my word, and I swear on my life that I'll learn and I'll work and I'll make everything right for us. For you.""*

I have gone longer than a decade without shedding a single tear. I didn't cry when I was suicidal. I didn't cry when I was poor and nearly homeless. I didn't cry when I was forced to move back with my traumatizing family. I didn't cry when my social circle crumbled and I was left all alone. I didn't cry from the pressure of having to perform academically so I could make a good living afterwards, since no one will help me pay the bills. And I didn't cry when I discussed each and every one of these points during my years of therapy, in every wretched detail.

But last night, I cried. Cried while meditating, then cried again while talking about it to my cell phone, then just cried again after writing these last paragraphs right now. Proper ugly crying, with lots of tears and having my face involuntarily contort into pained expressions. No therapy I've ever done has evoked such a strong emotional response, which is partly why I gave up on CBT just a month ago. Turns out, I really did just have to talk to myself. I still think that sounds sort of silly, but it's undeniable that it made *something* happen, and it was something interesting. I regained my ability to cry. Perhaps more crucially, it might be easier to motivate myself into keeping up the painful healing work if I frame it not as ""working to heal myself"", but as ""working to take care of my inner traumatized teenager"". It's almost like I have more sympathy for him than for myself, since I'm a strong independent adult and he's so vulnerable.

Now, I'm not sure where I go with this. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not in therapy anymore, and it's by choice. I'd really like to be reassured that all this ugly crying will be useful, and that I'm not just re-traumatizing myself for no reason, but now I let go of my only external reference point.

Longtime lurker, first time poster here. 

I have finally committed to changing my legal name. I have wanted to change my name to distance myself from my abusive past for some time now. This lead me to looking into the various legal hoops I will have to jump through to change my name. This is where the brief rant comes in. 

Turns out I need 2 affidavits from people who I am not related to and who live in my county to change my name. While this objectively may not be a big deal, I really struggle to make friends. My past has left me antisocial and distrusting of those around me. Quarantine has only made that worse. I really don't know what I am going to do. I really feel like I've just had my wings clipped. 

I know I could just put on a happy face and try to make some friends all the while hoping they will be willing to help me change my name. But I really do not like the idea of doing this, feels too close to using people for my comfort.

Last night, I went through something quite terrifying. 
I was alone in my room, basically having a breakdown and I wrote about three pages of everything horrible I could think about myself, judging and belittling myself harshly for my existence and the abuse I endured. The worst insults you would say to your worst enemy.
I was “finally” confirming that it was all my fault and I deserved no better than that. The most hurtful insults you could say to your worst enemy. 
And because there was so much pent up anger and anguish, I started to physically hurt myself a bit (not enough to seriously hurt me, but enough that it was frightening for me). 
It felt like I really went down the Mariana Trench of my mind.

Now, I get that all this sounds really alarming for outsiders, but for some reason it felt kinda freeing afterwards, because it was the first time I wasn’t actively trying to fight my self-deprecating beliefs or avoid feeling them.

But you know what? I'm done making excuses for her. I'm done avoiding the truth. I KNOW for a fact, and have internally always known, that if she had treated me with the love, respect, patience, and basic fucking human DECENCY that a child (or anyone) deserves, I would NOT have ended up hating myself like I did. I would NOT have constantly browbeaten myself for being ""stupid."" I would not have felt like I was unworthy and despicable for having negative feelings, and certainly wouldn't have been brainwashed into believing that I was SO stupid, SO worthless, and so selfish and despicable that I deserved to fucking die for my sins, at the ripe old age of 17.

I've always explained away my mental illness by saying that I have a more ""sensitive/depressive"" temperament, that I probably would have had mental health issues anyway but the way she treated me just made it worse.

When I'm triggered I usually cry and feel suicidal and direct my emotions inward onto myself. Sometimes I rant at others when I'm not aware that they're not the ones I'm mad at, but usually I just cry and feel suicidal. Recently I've put it together that my partner mostly yells and rants when he's triggered.

I know it's a trigger response because at the height of the ranting/tense behaviour, if I ask him why he's mad at me (since I didn't do anything but agree with him), he has no grasp on reality in those moments. He suddenly believes he's being attacked when he isn't (I'm literally just smiling and nodding and agreeing sometimes, unaware that he's triggered). He knows they're trigger responses now but he doesn't yet know how to not yell and distinguish reality from flashback. I only know how to deal with my own crying/suicidal trigger response so my advice to him doesn't apply that well.

What do you do if you're a ""yeller""? How do you notice that you're triggered, notice that you're not truly mad at the person in front of you, and then de-escalate yourself? I want specific steps.

Who she convinced my mom to hit us to have well behaved children, which was really still bad even if she didn’t use hard plastic skipping ropes or my bamboo stick of my butterfly net. He and my mom had a really hard relationship, always yelling and his verbal abuse led to her getting angry and breaking stuff.

When he had to start working again, I started having problems in school. I found out much later on I have ADHD. But I had always been told not to draw attention to myself, stay quiet, because Chinese girls are polite and disciplined.

As he started working again, he was more stressed and prone to lashing out. He even threaten to kill us and we hid in my sister’s room.  As a teen and recently he said he didn’t want us.

And with all the trauma I had with his stupid narcissist mother, I find out he has Grave’s disease in my anatomy class after years of struggling in school. Which is an autoimmune disease which is theorized that exposure to severe stressors and high levels of subsequent distress such as PTSD can put you at risk of it? Females are 7X more likely to put you at risk.

I’m having really mixed feelings... I care about it and felt like I needed to not get so mad at him because I knew he had health issue with his thyroid that made him tired. And he grew up with a fucking narcissist mom. That he depended on and we got stuck living with her because Chinese sons take care of their mothers.

I think I knew why I took an health program, I find it interesting but I don’t like it as much I would’ve for design... because I knew I can’t fucking trust the adults in my life to help me with shit.

52,Best-Investigator261,1614172652,"TW: anxiety, panic, suicidal push

I went to the grocery store yesterday late afternoon and left as was feeling on edge, so didn’t buy anything. I was just prior in another store and was fine. After leaving grocery store I sat in my car feeling frozen and not sure what to do for half an hour. 

I tried breathing, meditating, walking in the parking lot, rubbing my hands and body. Nothing was working. 

Looking back I was on edge of anxiety attack at least, with no clarity about where it came from. I felt unable to make the decision to start my car to drive home, or to go back to the store to purchase what I went in for. 

I called a friend I knew could help, and they didn’t answer. Another friend had just messaged, so I messaged back asking her to call me as I needed help (different countries, she had a calling plan to me). She called. 

The conversation put me over the edge into a sobbing panic attack. After a few minutes of trying to use logic to help me (not helpful while in that state), she said “if things are that bad, maybe you should give up and kill yourself”. Her tone sounded angry, and her voice had gotten louder. I hadn’t been anywhere close to that feeling, though had been expressing loneliness and hopelessness about being isolated alone the past year during the pandemic.

Her statement quickly took me to that feeling of ‘maybe I should die’, so that didn’t help at all, and I said so. 

Her response “yeah, well, being like this for years isn’t helping either, so figure it out” or something to that effect. I don’t quite remember the last part of her statement. She still sounded angry and voice was louder. I was in significant distress at this point and highly disassociating. 

This statement also didn’t help. I felt massively worse for being an idiot who has shitty stuff come up and not managing better and being a burden to anyone who cares. To be fair, I still have rough days, but overall last few months I’ve been getting better, to the point of feeling capable to work again. The isolation of the pandemic plus other significant life stressors had greatly impacted my progress, but I’ve been on an upswing overall. So her statement felt really unfair and harsh too. Especially given her cancelling many planned phone calls for months while she’s been struggling, and we haven’t connected in a while, so she hasn’t heard about my good periods. I have never laid into her about how she’s been doing and all the cancellations. 

Through my sobs, I at least managed to say “I’m hanging up now, this is not helping at all.” I’m proud of myself for that, as in the past with people I’d stay on the phone and continue to receive shit, thinking I’d be rude to hang up. 

I know now that she isn’t equipped or able to support while I’m on the cusp of who knows what that was. Not her fault. I haven’t read her texts since as I’m trying to process what happened and why those statements sent me spiralling. 

Feels like her statements put me into feeling very small as a child and wondering why my parents are angry and saying hurtful things to me.. why they wouldn’t just hug me when I was sad. Why me being a little kid and sad made them angry. I learned quickly to not be sad, try to be perfect, and be as helpful as possible to minimize the abuse. 

All I know is, those are not the helpful things to say to someone in the state I was in. They are the opposite. Logic and reason are also not helpful in that place. What I needed was to be listened to and emphasized with. I suspect if that was the stance she took, I would not have shifted into a full blown breakdown. I would have eased out of the edge I was on generally okay. 

I did manage to drive home after that, because I had to get back for a meeting. I shouldn’t have driven in the state I was in though, as I was highly disassociated and sobbing all the way (about 10 minutes). I did arrive home safely. It took an hour to be functional again, but managed the meeting okay, though still pretty off. Turns out years of my feelings not being valid to others and stuffing them down helped me manage for that meeting. 🙄

Anyway, that was a surprising experience. Haven’t had that happen before. And it really sucked.

UPDATE - Adding my reply from below.


Hey, thanks everyone. Appreciating all your replies. I don’t feel awesome today, but I’m managing okay, even completed a few tasks and a few meetings. Pretty drained now, but will do good self care tonight. 

I did share about this with my social worker and the good friend I couldn’t get ahold of yesterday, and they both agreed that what she said wasn’t okay, that she’s really not available for support, and to be clear on what is available for me in the relationship if I continue with it. 

I took a peek at one of the messages she sent afterward (without opening them, I’m not ready yet), and she apologized saying what she said wasn’t okay, and she feels helpless in not being able to help me, and it’s been hard seeing me struggle for so long. 

This person has been a good friend at times over many years, and has been available for support through tough spots at times. 

And, she’s also flakey with contact, and does have some traits similar to some past friends and family of origin. Though she’s been more available and supportive than my family. 

I don’t know that I’m ready to end our friendship. I do feel I need to figure out how to be more clear in expressing my feelings and thoughts, and stop avoiding conversations that feel unsafe (such as this one, and how erratic she’s been like cancelling so many calls last minute).

Won’t be replying with much when I do. Will take some space to reflect before I decide anything (I’m trying hard not to respond while disregulated). Will be evaluating what a relationship will look like if it continues.

53,dialectical_aspie,1614172304,"I've recently learned (after breakup) about my cptsd and finally realized why my life has always been a sturggle. My gf and I were together for 3 and a half years, but were best friends for years before the relationship started and were always there for eachother, she always meant the world to me and my love for her goes very deep. She broke up with me 6 months ago, mostly because I'm emotionally unstable, dissociate a lot and have a hard time achieving in life and being productive, and was kinda codependent a lot. We've ended it on good terms and in polite and mature way, and I initiated no-contact a few days later. Neither of us knew what is going on and why am I having such a hard time just having a normal life. She was patient with me, gave me several chances but I just kept pushing myself more and more over the limit of what I can do and suppressing my emotions and falling deeper into denial, so she got frustrated that I was not making any real progress. Now that I know what is going on with me, I lately started considering talking to her and telling her all that I learned in hope that we could work together on my issues, because I feel I'm making real progress for the first time in my life.

I have no real friends. I have a few ""friends"" that I hang out with sometimes, but was always emotionally closed with them and pretended that I'm cheery and happy guy for years. Now that I tried to reach out to them and tell them that I'm stuggling with cptsd, they just kinda listened to me for a bit but quickly got tired and are just telling me the usual bullshit of just work hard it'll be fine and that I just need therapy maybe (which is true but I also need friends who can listen to me once in a lifetime), one friend even told me if I wasn't overthinking it there would be no real problem. The messaging with them is getting more infrequent as well since I started being more open, so I guess that's over with too.

I'm still a student at 25 years and have no money for therapy right now and I'm desperate, I just wanted to talk to someone, my ""friends"" are not the option anymore, so I decided to reach out to one person in my life to whom I trust, I messaged my ex-gf and told her I want to talk to her. She replied that she met some new guy that is very sweet and can't meet with me. I'm just devastated. I have no support, no one I can trust, I'm not on good terms with anyone in my family, and it's really hard to process all these emotions (both new and old ones that are surfacing now) and start healing alone. I'm still in love with my ex so much that every minute of my life is painfull, and she already has someone new on top of all of this as well. I feel broken, and as though this is it, everyone has left me and I will never make any new connections and will be isolated forever, most of my life in best scenarios people just ignored me and in worst outright hated and bullied me anyway, im just self-isolating more and more and losing everybody without any hope of meeting new people.

""His perceived loss of control leads to Mike's experiencing intense and distressing negative emotions. He feels highly anxious, sad, and ashamed. ""I should be able to cope. I'm weak."" The experience of negative emotion, too, leads Mike to feel out of control. His core beliefs -- ""I'm out of control. I'm helpless. I'm weak. I can't function"" -- become fully activated. He sees himself as being in grave danger, not from an external threat, but from one that he cannot escape. **No matter where he goes, his mind goes with him...…He believes he must avoid all that he loves, or risk tainting it with insanity.** He also engages in emotional avoidance......But avoidance fuels his belief of weakness. He is in a double bind: **""If I avoid, I'm in control, I can function. But If I avoid, it means I'm helpless, defective, out of control. But if I don't avoid, I'm in danger.""**

68,Kreki86,1614158328,"I have a problem I'm sure it's pretty common among people who've experienced trauma of different kinds. I'm also an only child and not used to ""siblings rivalry"", which might contribute.   


Growing up I wasn't allowed to express myself and have an opinion. I was never physically abused or anything, but was extremely scared of other people's rage and anger. If I said anything they didn't agree with I was met with frustration and temper.  I got used to walking on eggshells around people who behaved this way. My parents fought a lot, but never anything dramatic, just verbal confrontations and expressing anger. 

I have never expressed my anger and have a tendency to build it up. I've just been an outlet for others anger. For all my life I've been very timid and quiet in these situations.  

I absolutely hate confrontations and arguments (but love quiet discussions). This has caused me to never ""pick a fight"" with anyone. I never comment on others actions and behaviour. I notice people doing and saying stupid things all the time, but I don't think bringing it up is worth it. I just don't want any kind of trouble.

**The problem is that when I treat people this way, I expect them to do the same with me. I especially have problems with people who does and says a lot of stupid things that I choose to not bring up. When I then do something and they keep commenting and confronting me about it I get extremely frustrated, because they fail to see their own flaws, but keep picking on others'. These are typically people who lack introversion and never notice/admit their own mistakes. They rarely botter to listen if I tell them why I did it that way. This makes me come off as really fragile and easily ""butthurt"". But I'm not offended by what they say, but by the lack of manners on the person saying it. These persons often get easily defensive and angry if someone points out the things they keep point out too. This causes me to feel run over by people who behaves this way.**

**I realize ""it takes two to tango"" and  that I'm part of the problem. I just feel like I'll end up like the losing part what ever I do. Either I get run over, or else I have to have fights and confrontations I don't want. Winning a conversation doesn't give me any pleasure, I just want to avoid them alltogether and just have a quiet conversation to solve problems.**",CPTSD,"Avoiding confratations, not speaking my mind and building up anger",https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lr8h36/avoiding_confratations_not_speaking_my_mind_and/,1614129528.0

the invalidation has been to the extreme for a while now and it's become almost an obsession to invalidate myself but I can't help it . it's been completely out of control and horribly painful and exhausting . I see people with more trauma and symptoms as more valid and superior then me and normal people in general.

I was *only* physically abused , emotionally and verbally abused and emotionally neglected . but I wasn't sexually abused . I wasn't even beaten on a daily basis or screamed at or anything so it doesn't mean shit .

But he told his friends I did things to him that aren’t true. He told everyone I was a pedophile and that I raped him. He turned my whole social circle against me. They sent death threats. They told me they hoped I’d kill myself. They made throwaway accounts after throwaway accounts to get their kicks at my own expense. I tried to kill myself 3 times that year, on my birthday, on his birthday, the day he made his new partner send photos and videos of them making out to me to show me how horrible of a person I am. I never told anyone about my attempts until now. 

I don’t fuck children. i would never even think about doing that fucked up shit. I never touched him without consent, I would never do anything without consent. I still believe everything he said and it’s been four years. 

I’ve been with someone new the past 2 and we’ve been so happy! The person in my life is so mature, we communicate when things aren’t good, we work with each other and I’ve never been in such a healthy and enriching relationship! 

But this man, no, this boy haunts me. He still doesn’t think he did anything wrong when he tried to talk to me. I haven’t eaten or slept in days. I’m so hungry but I can’t hold anything down. I’m so tired but the xanax I have saved for emergencies doesn’t keep me from having panic attacks. I missed a midterm in class. I’m so close to self harming again after 2 years of being clean but I’ve been holding myself back because I’m seeing a surgeon tomorrow for a procedure I have pined over a decade for, and the last thing I need is to be seen as too unstable for something life changing that I have waited half my life for.

I hope he’s happy with how terrified he makes me. I hope he’s happy that after all these years the fear of him dictates my life! I hope he’s happy that this fear dictates my best friend that he also abused in the same manner! I hope he never stops thinking about me. I hope he regrets everything. I damned hope so because I am not giving him any chances to make a genuine apology. As if he’s ever genuine. He will always be nothing more than a shallow boy of a man, chewing up the next person he charms and spitting them out when he’s bored of them and wants to create drama. He has done this with every person he’s shared his life with, friends and romantic partners alike.

I have to live the rest of my life preparing for the next time he tries to work his way back into my life. I have to always be on the lookout. I haven’t made new friends since then. I can’t trust anyone anymore I can’t even tell people what my favorite color is or what my favorite foods are or what I like to do.

So, a few weeks ago, my friend and I were spending some time together, talking about our abusive childhoods, among other things, and it eventually led to her saying she thinks I was sexually abused growing up. I told her with absolute certainty that she was wrong.

But she knows about abuse. First hand. And whenever any of my lovers touch me in certain places, I basically collapse in euphoric pain. No, not those places. My ribs, neck and upper arms mostly.

I don't remember what her reaction was, but the idea that I was sexually abused growing up has been gnawing at me ever since.

I have no memory of any sexual abuse from anyone, but my childhood is full of holes.

Y'know when you forget something exists, but as soon as someone mentions it, you remember it in vivid detail?

Well, there are massive parts of my childhood that I just cannot for the life of me remember. The parts I can remember, are either like reliving my childhood and having the literal shit beaten out of me in stunning 16K VR where I can hear, taste, feel, smell, and see everything. I'm sitting in my recliner, alone in my house, but I can feel the beatings like they're happening right now. I feel like I'm going to wake up tomorrow with a multicoloured ribcage and a swollen face.

Or it's like looking through a keyhole during an earthquake. Like that memory I have of being alone in a hotel room with my uncle. Or the awkward silence when I mentioned being in Chucky Cheese and a hotel room with that same uncle. Or when my dad seemed to distance himself from me for a time when I was little. Or when I was institutionalized when I was nine for reasons that I will never know because everyone involved is retired or dead.

Whatever.

Anyways, ever since my friend said she thinks I was sexually abused growing up, I've been rethinking my entire life.

It doesn't help that whenever I'm having sex, I'm more than a little rough.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if anything about what I said about my uncle is true. I just have the memory of a memory of a memory.

What should I do about this? I can't ask my friend right now because we're having our own problems with our own lives, and I don't want to lay this at her feet while she's in the wrong state of mind. And I don't have anyone else to talk about it with. I have other people, sure, but none of them are the kind of people I'd ever talk to about this. Maybe one of my therapists.

85,venicedancingqueen,1614146757,"TW: CSA, emotional abuse, intimate partner sexual violence and self harm

I just need to get some of this stuff off my chest. I don’t know what to do, I literally just cannot bring myself to drag myself out of bed. I have trouble staying motivated to do my schoolwork, but it’s been particularly bad lately.

I usually attribute it to the main cause of my trauma. I was sexually abused by my brother at a really young age and have struggled to cope with it for as long as I’ve been able to understand what happened. I’ve coped with self harm since I was 12, but have been doing a fairly good job staying clean despite struggling.

But about 2 weeks ago, I just woke up one day already exhausted. I skipped a class and told my professor I was sick and just stayed in bed all day. I played sick to all my professors the whole week and just continued to stay in bed. I told myself I’d stop doing this after the weekend, but I just feel completely incapable. I’ve just felt completely numb and empty, like I’m just wasting days at this point for the sake of moving forward.

Usually when I get this numbed out, all I wanna do is self harm. And I do, I really want to so bad, but I can’t even bring myself to get out of bed and walk across my apartment to dig up my blades. Which makes me feel even more pathetic, but at the same time I just don’t even really care?

Then yesterday, I started experiencing flashbacks and anger seemingly out of nowhere. Usually this happens with my childhood trauma, but yesterday it was all about my emotionally abusive ex.

I blocked him a couple months after we broke up last year because I tried to explain to him for the 100th time that I never wanna get back together because he raped me early in our relationship and it was something I feel weak and foolish for forgiving him for. He tried once again to tell me I’m wrong about what happened that night, but I know what happened. Over the course of a few days he lashed out on me over nothing, and I hit a point where I knew I had to just block him.

But now the entire relationship is doing the same things to me the CSA did. I couldn’t sleep last night cause my mind wouldn’t stop racing which eventually exhausted me enough to pass out. I had terrible dreams. Once again, I woke up at almost 2 in the afternoon and couldn’t bring myself to get out of bed. I feel so empty and drained, and the only thing that’s ever made the feeling go away is self harm. I’ve been clean since November and I’m trying so hard not to throw it all away but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep living with all of this, and I don’t know how I’m supposed to figure it out if I can’t even get out of bed.

My parents want me when they can control everything I do or say—when I am willing to be bullied into accepting fault for every single traumatic thing that happened in the past.

I don’t want to go to college anymore or do anything. I just want to sleep and cry. But I have exams. But I have essays. But I have extracurriculars. But I have commitments.

I am too busy to think about anything but when I do have time I don’t want to think about all the bad stuff. I’m so tired of feeling this way and I want a hug :(",CPTSD,Feeling alone,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lr4vr9/feeling_alone/,1614116291.0

Father physically and emotionally abused me.

Mother dissociating a lot not even realising I was being abused and neglected. 

At 11/12 I began getting sexual desires. My only sexual desires were being raped. Always by a vague image of a man based of images in media of older men who I found disgusting.

I used a hot water bottle to rub aggressively in that area which hurt as well.

I would sometimes use a blanket under my top and pretend to be pregnant from a previous rape and then pretend to be raped again.

It didn't feel good. It satisfied my hormones but it didn't feel good, it felt violent and like I was punishing myself.

It also felt very real while I was doing it to myself. I could hear the made up voice call me stupid and dirty and say disgusting sexually violent things to me which made me horrified. I would say ""stop please no"" and protest, imagining myself putting up a fight and being penetrated regardless.

I also have had emotional flashbacks now where I am screaming ""no please stop im scared"" and curling up in a ball hyperventilating and pushing my mother away violently whenever she tries to touch me.

I struggled with bed wetting every night as well as wetting myself in daytime and fear of using the bathroom throughout childhood.

I had suicidal ideation and severe depression from about 7/8 years old.

I had OCD which was severe as well.

I also frequently have nightmares now where I am being raped, sometimes multiple nightmares like this a night.

My mom experienced CSA from her father and many other men in her childhood. I worry that she chose a similar man to marry and have children with. I didn't know about my mother's CSA during childhood, when these behaviours took place, as she made sure not to tell me.

I have realised that nothing is impossible for my father. He is a liar and a child abuser. He is so narcissistic and manipulative so I feel secure in doubting him.

Throughout my childhood, I was obsessed with 'pushing' something 'out' of my cervix. At 11 I would lie down and pretend to have been raped by an old man and be pregnant from this rape. I would lie down and push, pretending I was giving birth to my rapist's unwanted child. It was so exhilarating, and I don't know why. The feeling of getting something out of me gave me so much sexual pleasure and general euphoria, like I was on the top of the world. The humiliation and dirty feeling felt good in a bad way as well, like with the rape masturbation. The imaginary rapist would jeer at me during this.

I have masturbated to rape imaginings more times than I can count (I wont say fantasies, because these thoughts were unpleasant in all ways to me except in my sexual region)

I don't go near my genitals now, as it feels like I'm being assaulted.

I touched myself through my clothing in my sleep the other night and felt like I had been sexually assaulted in the morning. I felt attacked.

I never want to be penetrated in my vagina.

I am obsessed with 'dirtiness'

I always feel dirty morally and have been using soap and water to try and wash off feelings of shame for nearly a decade. I wash when I feel shame about anything. Shame is so prominent in my body

I became very religious as a teenager. I liked that sexual acts and thoughts were forbidden completely. I felt secure and slightly clean

My dad never saw me getting changed. He never remarked on my body or my sexuality. The only 'breach of physical boundaries' I remember specifically (I forget 99% of my childhood and 98% of my teenage years) was when he hugged me and wouldn't let go even when I tried to fight him off.

What might be going on here? I would love a variety of perspectives.

91,ScienceReliance,1614143525,"WARNING Mention of physical abuse, lots of mental abuse and sexual assault.

My mom was my best friend, it only occurred to me as soon as I left home, literally within weeks (To get stable enough to care for her because her health was going down)

That the only reason we were friends is because she conditioned me through guilt and fear to be exactly what she wanted, when I said or did something outside of that box of being her, down to pressuring me into thinking I wanted to open a restaurant (her lifelong dream) so she could live it through me.

Mind you I wanted to work with reptiles from age 8, I was reading veterinary books by 10 with a medical dictionary to figure out the words. my whole life studying reptiles was a hobby. but it got crushed by her and my family. And then I wanted to be anything but a cook, it took years for her to break me down to agree. And I got a lot of ""why would you want to do that? scientists don't make a difference anyway, you won't actually get anywhere"" and my favorite (sarcasm) ""I just don't want to see you get hurt"" ENTIRELY implying I would fail and it'd break me.

Being ""unlike her"" ranged from expressing like in foods she didn't up to hinting that maybe we should give it another month or two before we move AGAIN, or hey I wanted to go to school! or maybe don't buy ANOTHER animal or questioning her at all. I'd get either shunned with piles of guilt that made me physically ill. mom would get sullen and quiet and given the cold shoulder for a while, after telling me all the ways SHE was hurt by it, which sucked because I wasn't allowed to know ANYONE else in the world, no school, no friends, nothing, I needed her, I didn't even know if I existed without her. I'd get talked down to and told I was wrong until I was ashamed and felt stupid (fairly common) Or she'd end up screaming at me and then call me my sister (which was more painful than any insult in the human language, my sister is a psychopath) 

The physical sickness and fear I developed for telling ANYONE no, is a major reason I got sexually assaulted when I was 18, and that just hit me. I said no to the guy for what must have been an hour or more, while he pinned me down, he kept asking, and asking, and once even said ""if you don't say yes, it's rape"" like... I was playing hard to get or something, but it was at that point I knew I wasn't going anywhere until I said yes. He was escalating over weeks and if I shut his advances down hard and early on like a normal human who was capable of that, when I first felt uncomfortable, it wouldn't have gotten that far. 

He made his intentions painfully obvious even though I stated mine clearly when we first met, when he pressured me I was terrified of saying no, so I'd just duck out of the situation, or awkwardly shift the subject. I met someone else just like him and when I shut that avenue down they accepted it as a lost cause. And the times it happened after where I was too afraid to even say no at all and figured it'd be over faster if I just said yes...it'd be easier, because I was taught that just saying yes, even if I felt uncomfortable, or thought it was wrong, or was afraid, or it made me feel sick to my stomach, meant everything would be over faster, and I could just deal with the fallout of it (which, my older self got to learn that NO, in fact I couldn't ""just deal with it"". Especially because after the first time he started to get angry and frighteningly possessive, and did the same thing my mom did, pin me in a corner and yelled at me, using guilt and fear in the EXACT same way and it left me frozen and voiceless. (of course this situation was much more complex than that, but I know for a fact, my conditioning for compliance and fear of upsetting people played a major role in it)

I was even afraid to tell my mom, because I was legitimately afraid she'd attack him and end up injured, in jail or dead from it because she just wasn't rational and assault was a sore point with her (She had been herself). He lived with us and I had to figure out how to get rid of him without her knowing why. When I'd never done anything, I'd never confronted anyone, or made a decision, I hadn't even talked to a male my age since I was 13.

Over the years I grew to just take queues from her, to just say or do what she liked, due to this I never had a personality. I'm still figuring out what I like. (plus side after all that darkness, I'm someone I find really interesting and admirable so...yay?)

I realized within weeks of leaving home that normal people encouraged you to broaden your horizons, and different opinions or likes were welcomed not shunned, little by little I developed my own interests, likes, personality traits, and a spine of pure titanium.

I went from being proud that I was ""my mothers daughter"" to burying that long dead costume I'd worn for so long out of self preservation. I walked on eggshells with every word around my mom when she called multiple times a day while I was away (I was 23) and it hit me talking to her was stressful, but it wasn't with my friends. Ironic considering she read a book called walking on eggshells and was 100% sure my sister fit all those boxes...she did but...mom did too in a lot of ways. I think the most glaring instance was this;

Once I told her I didn't want to move again. we were in Virginia, I was 13 or so, I had friends after years of being alone. We loved the town, we loved the people, her own best friend from her younger years lived there, which was why we went to visit. It was my very first time speaking my opinion, and I was shy and quiet when I first said it. 

We were getting ready to go to a Halloween party, the first time I dressed up or did anything for Halloween since I was 9 (and the time before that I was a baby). She yelled at me in response, I said I was sick of moving, she guilted me while screaming. We were living in a trailer park in our RV. We were dressing as witches in the park bathroom, it was going to be great, candy and karaoke for me, karaoke and booze for the grownups, her old friend...meg, and 2 of meg's friends who loved my mom the second they met her, it was going to be an amazing night for me. Almost like going to a party. And she felt that was a great time to tell me;
""hey fuck this great town, great people and all these opportunities, let's leave all these things and people you like that I let you get attached to because I said we were moving here :) ""
After a back and forth that steadily grew more heated from her side until I was yelling too on response to her yelling, because I decided to argue this time (But arguing for me is replying with reasonable counter points, not yelling) I was backed into the corner while she screamed in my face. It was the first time I yelled at her, that I wanted to go to school and live in a house, or an apartment, that I was sick to death of cars and trailers and people were OFFERING to help us get settled and it wasn't fair. I can't remember what she said exactly but it boiled down to I was a kid, I was wrong and if I didn't agree with her I must think she was a horrible mother, and HOW DARE I, and I didn't know what fair was, and maybe I was turning into my SISTER.

I cried on the way to the party. I was a frustrated freshly minted teen, who had her mom scream in her face for the first time so close she got spit on me, I was scared, and FURIOUS, the first time I'd ever felt such pure anger and hatred towards my mom. I've been angry like that less than ten times in my life, I yelled at her one last time about her not listening to me, and I didn't want to go to the party, and that I hated her. So she hit me while we were at a stop. I cried harder, she told me to stop crying, and that she didn't even hit me that hard, and how I was being a drama queen. It was the 2nd time in my life she hit me (I was 5 last time). And then we went to the party and she made me suck it up and act normally, because the first screaming match of your life, being hit and the bombshell that this was one of the last time's you ever see all these people you now loved, was always a great way to pre-game fun.  

Somehow I just burred that over the following weeks, we moved again, I was distraught, but like usual it faded, I never quite felt comfortable around my mom anymore though. She bought back my love, by acting like we were BOTH angry and it's NEITHER of our faults, and we are a team, it's ONLY us, her and me against the world. 

And just like that we were best friends. I don't know why or how I felt that was okay, or why I just let that go as a blip when I could see her boiling and one toe would set off the same storm when I started to step out of line after that. The few times I did the exact same thing happened no matter how reasonably I tried to approach the situation, she'd guilt, and then scream when it didn't work, and then I'd scream. The last one was about her drinking. 

And somehow I'd just block out all the times I saw her simmering up and my stomach would knot up, and all the times she manipulated me like that, and felt we were BEST FRIENDS, thick as thieves, BFF's Ride or die. 

But in reality she manipulated me, emotionally abused and neglected me, she groomed and isolated me from a young age to be her little mini-me and servant, she used me for emotional support when a child should never have to, and forced me to be the strong one through situations NO one should have to experience, let alone a child. 

And she had me so fucked up I gave up multiple chances of freedom to take care of her when I was a god damn kid. 

At 24 I didn't think ""boy was that fucked up"" I just felt bad FOR her, made excuses for it, and blamed myself for her death. 

I'm 29 now and when I think too hard about my mother in law I start to cry, or get teary eye'd because my whole life I bought into the lie that my mother was a mother to me. And now I have a mother figure, one who cared for me when I came out of anesthesia, and kept me company while sick. One who get's me thoughtful gifts I actually want, like cozy socks and a 3d printer, or note books, or cheap fountain pens, things I LOVE (mom always got me gifts she wanted me to want like yay (sarcasm)...a basket of fondant and tools so I could learn how to make cake decorations) Which isn't important, I don't care about gifts, I feel awkward getting anything, but the fact that she took the time to know me, and get me things I truly love means so...SO much to me. 

And MIL actively encourages me to follow my dream of reptile conservation. She calls me on my birthday and sings it to me, she gives me womanly advice about stuff mom never taught me (like pressuring me to see a lady doctor, which I've never done because if you're not dying there's no reason to see a doctor according to my mom). MIL calls me one of her kids, we are friends. But not in the same way as a normal friend, she feels like a mother, she's there for me, I can ask her hard questions and seek advice, I can go to her for comfort even though I don't. It isn't the same situation because she isn't my mom, but she didn't hesitate to make me one of her kids and treats me exactly like her own. She doesn't want to step on the toes of her adult DIL. But the silent offer is loud and clear, the parental love, support and pride is there and I had never felt that before. The only time she ever got angry at me was when I (very jokingly said) that I wasn't technically family yet so I could take the family Christmas photos...She did not find that funny, like at all.

And it's just so fucked up, it's so unfair that I never felt that before, and some stranger who's son I'm with took up the job so easily. It showed me how little my mother had to do, how simple it was to just be a MOM and not my friend, or treat me like her property. I needed SO little from her, and somehow she even fucked that up. I mean she couldn't even keep me clothed and fed, so I don't know what I expected.  

Which is shitty because THAT is the reason it makes me cry. Not because of how wonderful she is (because she is). but because knowing her makes me resent my mom so god damn much.

I did not see a single bit of love between them at any time.  No physical affection.  No affectionate words.  No gift giving.  No helping each other.

All I saw was abuse and dysfunction.

I have been extremely emotionally numb all my life and have been really frustrated at my inability to have a crush.  I faked it all throughout middle and high school.  I just had no desire to have any sort of connection like that with anyone.  I was also preoccupied with finding a rescuer.

I tried dating people of different genders.  I tried dating classmates or strangers.  Nothing sparked anything inside of me.

I felt something like I never have before a few days ago.  Someone I had known for years suddenly seemed so different.  We hung out a couple times and I cannot even begin to explain what I am feeling right now.  It’s such a strange yearning I have never felt before and that I did not believe I was capable of feeling.  Wow it feels so amazing!

They’re so gentle and kind.  They’re compassionate to everyone and knows how to make anyone smile.  They’re funny and artistic.  They’re the complete opposite of my father.  I can trust them because I have known them for so long, even if from the standpoint of a acquaintance/friend.

I truly thought I was aromantic or broken.  But I finally feel it.

Of course I’m still horrified.  I don’t feel good enough.  I keep doubting they feel the same way.  I don’t know how to flirt or show love at all.  I don’t know how to be vulnerable and let them in.  I’m scared I’m too awkward and shy and that they will lose interest.  I’m scared I will ruin this.  I’m really scared I’ll misread everything and make things weird by making a move.  I still feel too inadequate to be liked back by anyone.  I have no idea how this works or what to do next.

But I’m working on it.  I have spent all day researching about how to show someone you like them and how to do this.  I’m working on myself and reading and going to therapy.  I’m really excited to open up this part of my life now.

I've been seeing the one I'm seeing now for about 18 months now, only 1 week skipped because it was Christmas. I was feeling like I had hit a plateau and was really getting discouraged when all hell broke loose at home. Our daughter finally admitted that her boyfriend and the father of her 2 year old was a narcissistic abuser and got either scared enough or brave enough to take the baby and disappear.

Our little 912 square foot home now has 2 more people and a WHOLE LOT more stuff. Quiet is a thing of the past.

Because of what our daughter has been through she has become extremely passive /aggressive, which is a ginormous trigger for me.

She was having a terrible meltdown about being asked to pick up the toys that were covering the living room floor and instead of reacting like I used to, (punching walls, screaming and basically acting just like she was), I calmly gathered some snacks, a big cup of coffee, my book and some yarn and a crochet pattern, went into my bedroom, quietly closed the door, put in my earbuds and crocheted the baby 2 hats!

Spent the rest of the day in there and was so pissed I actually did think about throwing stuff at the wall, but was able to find a different way of coping!

I realized today just what a big step it was and it blew me away, considering I was feeling like I wasn't getting anywhere in therapy. My husband saw the difference and told me how proud of me he is. More important, I'm really proud of myself for being able to act in a way that protected both me and my daughter from shit she doesn't need and didn't escalate the whole situation.

96,cheesesteak2018,1614140939,"**TLDR:** after talking to a friend who described why/how he was grounded as a kid, I realized mine was totally f'd up. I would get grounded for saying how I felt/my opinion, even in a calm/respectful tone, and I think that's why I am afraid to share my true emotions now with my therapist.

I am an only child and, when I would get in trouble, it was usually ""no TV for a week"" or ""no electronics for a week"". Well, every night my parents would sit on the couch in the living room and watch TV after work. So any potential family time was going to be while they were watching TV. This was also my only option for human interaction since I was likely grounded and made to stay home as well.

We'd be eating dinner and they would say ""okay go do homework, we want to watch TV"" and kick me out. If I needed them, I wasn't allowed in the family room because the TV was on, so they would have to either approve me to come in or walk to the kitchen to basically meet with me. If I needed them too much, they'd get annoyed and tell me to go away. So at like 6yo, I was basically needing to make my own decisions during those times. They also treated me like I was a nuisance when I was grounded. 

I got grounded for stupid things too: not taking the trashes out soon enough after they got full, failed a test (A in the class, but fail one test), ""talking back"" aka saying my opinion, etc. They got enjoyment out of grounding me.

110,Capleau,1614133290," Hi everyone! I don’t usually post and I am new-ish to Reddit, but wanted to ask: do outside noises trigger you? 

I live in an apartment complex and I’m really sensitive to sounds, it can really change my mood, and feelings of safety. I can’t really focus on much else when it’s loud outside because I am left feeling triggered and seriously overwhelmed. I don’t have any direct triggers to yelling, or loud noises that I can think of- but it shuts me down, overwhelms me and it’s all I can focus on when it happens is getting away from it so I can think straight again. My body feels it. 

My apartment complex is small, and has a courtyard in the center where all the kids play outside together. Many kids are still home due to covid. They scream, stomp, yell, and run when they play, often running past my door and it shakes my apartment when they run up the stairs, as well as some other adults who run/ stomp on the stairs. My front door is right by the stairs too. 

I also feel bad for the kids because they aren’t in school and obviously have energy to get out, they’re kids. 

Keep in mind, my apartment is upstairs. Outside of my front door, there is a narrow motel-style sidewalk with railing. 

Every time this happens, which is everyday now, I try to drown out the sound with music or tv, but usually end up getting more anxious because I can still hear everything outside, even with the music or tv on. Plus once I’m triggered/ overwhelmed I need quiet not more sounds. 

To make matters worse there is a neighbor that has regular drinking parties (they’re probably in their 20s) with loud music, yelling and more abrupt sounds. It happens regularly. 

Basically I’m stuck living here for now, and I end up hiding in the bedroom where the sounds are lessened but still present. I just feel trapped. 

I guess I’m mostly venting, but I came here to ask if anyone else experiences this issue, and if so what to do you to cope, outside of hiding?

It was her, she didn’t really acknowledge what happened and I was nervous and hesitant to continue talking on the phone so I suggested that she email me.  Her not acknowledging reality, pretending nothing happened when IT DID HAPPEN the last time was it for me.  Honestly, I was so proud of myself for having the email alternative at the ready.  It made me realize how far I’ve come and because I’ve been so isolated lately I haven’t had a lot social interactions to test the waters out so to speak.  This sub has has so much to do with that, so grateful.  This account is throwaway, just in case.  She was nice enough but alarm bells were going off for me. 

I told her let’s try email and I’ll text you my email address.  I was driving during this and less that an hour later I got a text that said “I won’t contact you again”  - which she says each voicemail and like clockwork does it again - and then really tried to lay on the guilt, thick.  Saying she’s willing to talk it out but I am not and she “played victim”.  It hadn’t even been an hour.  In the past I would have fallen for this shit.  Oh, no I should have texted her sooner and now I’ve upset her and on and on.  I remember towards the end feeling like I had to walk on eggshells around her.

Anyway, in the past I would have waited to craft a response and “overthink it”. I didn’t,  I just wrote back what I really thought and felt.  Hold up, wtf?  We haven’t talked in 5 plus years. Here’s my mail and such.  Then she says I’d love to chat over email.  I’m thinking it’s starting again, she’ll pretend which is why I said email to begin with.  Then a I’d love to chat over the phone text, I said no and left it at let’s try email and see how it goes.  

Now a few days later I’m feeling conflicted, but not if that makes any sense at all.  I know I did the right thing for me but there something nagging at me.  Maybe I should have softened my response then the other part of me is all hell no, right on sister.   Maybe I’m just anticipating a nasty email or some other bs.

I left my parent's house when I was 15, my dad was an alcoholic and always blamed me for my mother's death who died while giving birth to me.

Taking care of a drunk father and cleaning up after him never gave me a chance to socialize or make friends when I should have. I finally emancipated after one day he was drunk and kept hitting me with a broken charger chord and asking me if it was hurting and I kept crying with a fake smile on my face and saying no it doesn't.(One of my second cousin helped me with it)

Since then I've been working and trying to survive I've finally completed about 3 years worth of college classes.

I made some friends along the way but they are friends you go out with to have drinks and laugh and then don't see them for weeks. I didn't feel what it means to love or care about someone till I met my girlfriend only person who's ever said to me that ""YOU WILL BE OKAY"". Before that I had checked out and had no expectations in life to be ever happy. It seemed like a consistent battle every single day and like there could never be any peace but it was okay.

I started to feel something during first few times we hung out and didn't even realize what was happening. When she hugged me I felt alive again, I felt like I cared for life for the first time in my life. It wasn't excitement, it wasn't a huge rush flowing though my veins it was peace!!

We did a lot of things together, even had a funeral ritual for my mom and  my dog who died when I was 14. I healed, loved and slept(I suffer from heavy insomniac episodes because of my night terrors)

We rescued a puppy who belonged to her one of her housemates(An alcoholic couple who'd neglect and abuse their dog)

We recently broke up, I once said to her if you ever want to leave I'll be okay without you two because I am used to being alone.

But I don't feel okay, I feel like I'm fighting a lost battle. Hell I don't even feel like fighting.

Jorah(our dog) is the last thing I'm clinging on to, she has known him longer and I know she loves him more than I ever will but giving his custody over makes me feel like after giving away the reason to live I am finally giving away my last breath too.

I don't know what to do. I have been doing everything my therapist has been telling me. Working out daily, not skipping work, going home, taking Jorah on runs, and interacting with my housemates.

It just keeps getting worse, and I just want don't want to feel it anymore.

My dad's voice keeps screaming at me "" you are the reason!! , You shouldn't be alive!!""

I usually can't display my negative emotions or feelings, I want to but they just don't come out. My dad's voice comes back and asks ""Does it hurt"" and the voice inside my head says ""NO"" and I don't even get a say in the matter.

One friend frequently withdraws as a way of dealing with their CPTSD. In the past, they have spent a week or two alone before coming back to socialising with me (and others).

They have always been open about their withdrawal, saying that they need some time and space for a while. I try to be respectful of that, but I do miss them while they are gone.

Recently, they have decided to take a much longer withdrawal period. It has been a few weeks since we've messaged each other, and another week or more since we last saw each other.
They intend to spend another 2-3 months in solitude.

&amp;#x200B;

 Long story short, I was abused by a therapist when I was seven, and I'm still having a lot of trouble coping with that. I get panic attacks regularly as well as dissociation, flashbacks, and countless other symptoms that range from unpleasant to sometimes even debilitating. I want to get help. I need help. The problem is, most people who talk about healing from abuse, trauma, and mental illness seem to present therapy as the only viable treatment option. For obvious reasons, going to therapy is quite literally one of my biggest triggers. Furthermore, even if I did find a way to conquer that trigger enough to go to therapy, there is the issue that since the past abuse was by a therapist, any new therapist or medical professional who learns of this abuse would have to file a report even if I am an adult. This leaves me with two questions:

\#1: How can I go about seeking a diagnosis without having to see a therapist or having to disclose what happened to me beyond the fact than just saying that I experience a traumatic event? I'm open to seeing a medical doctor, just not a therapist because of what I mentioned before. I do believe I have a diagnosable mental health condition (probably several). However, I do NOT want to self diagnose anything, and I also think the first step to me receiving proper treatment would be to have an accurate name for what I'm actually treating. I also think that a diagnosis would give me access to valuable resources that I may not have access to without one.

My mom made tonnes of notes though about everything that happened so I could ask for these when I'm ready. She seemed to document things to have some control because she wasn't ready to leave the abuse (she and my 3 siblings were also abused)
I had a social worker at 1 year old but there was little to no intervention.

At 11/12/ I began getting sexual desires. L My only sexual desires were being raped. Always by a vague image of a man based of any nearby image in media of a man much older than me who I found disgusting. I am a female and used a hot water bottle to rub aggressively in that area which hurt as well. I would sometimes use a blanket under my top and pretend to be pregnant from a previous rape and then pretend to be raped again. It didn't feel good. It satisfied my hormones but it didn't feel good, it felt violent and like I was punishing myself. It also felt very real while I was doing it to myself. I could hear the made up voice call me stupid and dirty and say disgusting sexually violent things to me which made me horrified. I would say ""stop please no"" and other protests. Is this normal for an 11 12/13 year old?

I also have emotional flashbacks now where I am screaming ""no please stop im scared""
I struggled with bed wetting every night as well as wetting myself in daytime and fear of using the bathroom throughout childhood

I also frequently have nightmares now where I am being raped, sometimes multiple nightmares like this a night.

My mom experienced CSA from her father and many other men in her childhood. I worry that she chose a similar man to marry and have children with.

I always blamed my mental health and the fact that I was never educated about money - a off topic conversation in my family unless it was to berate or criticise. I'm now realising that maybe it's something more.

From an early age I suffered from abandonment, my mum was a childminder and so children would come and go, my first school closed and all my friends went to one school and I was sent to another. When it came to leaving that school again my family chose another school that my friends were not going to, when I left to go to college I wasn't allowed to go to the ones my friends were at. The cycle basically repeated itself, i'm not sure if it was intentional on my parents part although I feel sad that many people have long term friendships and those were all ripped from me. 

When I was 11 I was kicked out by my mum and her husband and I moved back and forth between hers and my dads house, if times were tough or they both went away I was sent to stay with friends or other family members so really was all over the place. 

In the last 16 years I have lived at over 14 addresses (I'm in my 20s). Now i'm starting to think that subconsciously the thought of staying put and being tied to a mortgage is terrifying. Coupled with the fact I'm not great with money I just feel like i'd be setting myself up for failure.

I got out of it finally and sought help as much as I could but I was not doing ok. Then in early 2019 I was diagnosed with a brain tumor and just shut down completely. I couldn’t work because of many of the tumor symptoms but also because emotionally I just couldn’t “life” anymore. All of the things I had been keeping under control (mostly through non-stop working 60 hr weeks and sheer denial and distraction) just went haywire.

I’m hopefully getting the tumor removed in the next few months but I have permanent brain damage and my life will never be normal. Today after a year of waiting I got the denial from disability. So now it’s on to the appeal which can take up to another year and a half. I just feel cold and numb. I don’t have it in me to fight anymore. It all feels completely pointless.

I'm not eating well. I can't cook any more because it's too tiring. I'm falling behind in friendships because I'm too tired for conversation.

I'm already on medication and going to therapy, I've spoken to my new therapist about this but it's very early days with them and this isn't something I can wait for an answer to. If I fall too behind in my course, I'll fail this year. I have accommodations but they can only do so much.

145,cumberlandgaptunnel,1614118803,"Sorry, this is kind of stream of consciousness. I try not to be too graphic. 

Early memory: I’m 6 years old, in first grade sitting in the hallway of my elementary school, all of us in a line. I’m looking at a classmate’s wrinkled but smooth brown leather shoe and thinking to myself “Sex. I’m not supposed to know what sex is.” And then the teacher calls us into the classroom. 

Today this flashback came with a very brief flash of being alone with my father in his room, I was too young to fully form memories I think. His blue fall jacket, the smell of his hair products. 

Other times I made a connection: there was the large brown cow teat that I was afraid to touch on a kindergarten field trip, when it was my turn in line I ran away.  

Also I have a straight up memory of being 3 or 4 and him showing me his genitalia in the shower under the guise of “explaining how it works.” Well, it was only that one time, I tell myself. Doesn’t everyone’s father do this? 

(Confusingly my mother also did the sudden shower sex education thing to me, but when I was a few years older, like 7 or 8.)

Oh and me being around 4 and walking in on him watching pornography on a projector screen in the basement (it was 1983), it was a group oral sex scene and when I asked what those people were doing he told me that they were “eating hot dogs.” 

I’m pretty numb about all of this today. I’ve admitted it all to myself in the past, I’ve actually healed a lot since I started therapy.

Growing up, I thought what I went through was fairly normal. As an adult, I learned that it was anything but. The physical and emotional abuse. Dealing with my narcissistic parents. The way I coped with it all morphed me into the mess I am today.

I’ve cut out my abusers. I still feel bad about it sometimes because they are my parents. I know I shouldn’t and I have every right to cut them out of my life but it still eats at me occasionally.

149,xotilbz,1614116799,"I recently got a new job which involves using very expensive equipment and being constantly observed by colleagues and supervisors as it's quite high stakes a mistakes can be very expensive. I am so terrified of making a mistake that I spend my entire shift trying to evade responsibility and step back and let others take over which isn't fair to my colleagues and stops me from learning how to do my job. I constantly ruminate over mistakes I have made and use them of evidence of my incompetence.

I try and be brave sometimes and be more assertive and that feels good in the moment because I think a lot of why I find work so distressing is the constant attempts to fawn and evade responsibility and be overly passive. I'm constantly purposely shifting my body language to avoid doing things, e.g. if my supervisor needs one person to volunteer to help with something I will start fiddling with my uniform or I will shift my body language so I'm further back and so it's easier for my colleague to help. It's exhausting and embarrassing. As soon as I do end up making a mistake I constantly ruminate over it and so it's like one step forward, ten steps back. I am thinking of going to my GP and asking for some anti-anxiety medication just to try and take some of the anxiety away - do you think that could help? I spend my break times breathing and looking for cues of safety and I can end up feeling relaxed and 'safe' at work even when I'm on the equipment but as soon as I need to do something in front of others or do something that is risky I panic and want to just run away. Everytime I have to use the equipment (which is automated) I flinch as I turn it on and I'm constantly trying to listen to it and look at it whilst doing my other work to check it hasn't gone wrong whereas my colleagues just leave it and trust it to do its thing. I panic at every new stage it gets to thinking of all the possible ways it could go wrong.

To be honest, this job is probably the worst possible job for my CPTSD and yet here I am, maybe having this job is a form of unconscious self-sabotage. It involves using very expensive equipment where the slightest error can cause not only thousands of pounds (£) of damage but also risk the health of myself and my colleagues. I just feel so incredibly fragile and get upset over the smallest things. I see other colleagues making mistakes and just brushing them off as human error, whereas if I do anything even slightly clumsy I decide I have to quit, I'm incompetent, etc. I've never actually made a mistake, just struggled with little things and needed a little more help understanding something than my colleagues.

161,Roseberry200,1614110917,"Sorry for confusing title. I have never been diagnosed with autism/aspergers. I have been diagnosed with PTSD.  Sometimes when i make posts about social anxiety and being social awkward, people ask me if i have been tested for autism or they say no offense but you may be on the austism spectrum. I cant take them seriously as they are not certified doctors/therapists and just going by assumptions.

So i looked up apsergers symptoms and it does seem kinda close to my behaviors such as obsessive thinking, hypersensitivity, having difficulty in social situations as i am very socially awkward, missing social cues sometimes. However, when i was a kid i did have OCD  and was very shy but i still made friends, if anything i had it easier in social situations and communicating when i was a kid then i do now.

 I read its harder to detect austism in women men which makes me wonder even more. It was only after puberty/ my trauma emerging that i started to  developing severe social anxiety, becoming very self conscious, becoming socially awkward due to years of self isolating and bullying. people called me weird and avoided me. Now its hard for me to keep relationships,overthinking simple interactions, think everyone is against me,  hard to have a proper conversation with someone because of my low self image, i either stare too long or too little,  sometimes talk over people, too emotional, im very empathic, i always have brain fog  prefer to be on my own because its safer that way and always depressed.

But still i wonder if im austic or its just the trauma. ehh",CPTSD,How do you know if it just your CPTSD mimicking autistic symptoms rather than you actually having austim/aspergers and CPTSD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lqrplw/how_do_you_know_if_it_just_your_cptsd_mimicking/,1614082117.0

163,mjz920,1614109991,"Psychodynamic therapy has helped me to understand that my parents made me feel like a “bad seed” when I was a kid. It seems they found parenting me to be really challenging, but rather than own up to that or seek help (that would bring them too much shame), they put the onus on me and decided I was just a “contrary,” “stubborn,” “spoiled,” bratty, disrespectful,’difficult kid, and they made sure I knew it. As a teenager, I was miserable and deeply hated myself, and at times I took out those feelings on other people, which I feel really guilty about (I have since apologized to almost everyone I mistreated). My past actions feed into my belief that I’m fatally and inherently flawed. Even though I now understand why I feel like a bad seed, and I logically understand that I’m not, I’m not sure how to internalize this and really feel like it’s true. My therapist says I should try to make more friends after COVID and that this will help me understand that I’m mostly good and worthy. But every time I try to meet people, I’m awkward as hell (socially stunted from a lifetime of trying not to offend or upset anyone, which amounted to basically making myself invisible). Any time someone seems to like me, I convince myself that it’s only because they don’t really know me, or I decide there must be something wrong with them given that they’re dumb enough to like me.

166,bexyrex,1614108906,"I want to start this by asking that people not come in here and try to ""convince"" me to become a parent. That's not what i'm here for. I have no intention of becoming a parent to a human child and that's a decision I came to with GREAT amounts of contemplation. 

 I want to talk about what it's like to be nurturing but not nurturing enough due to trauma. 

I am nurturing. I am caring. I loved and cared for and sacrificed myself for my horribly abusive mother for over 20 years. I loved and cared for every animal that came into my home as a child. I remember them all. Their names. Their personalities, how they lived and how they died. 

Lately i've been unpacking some heavy feelings around motherhood, my own mother, what I imagine I could have been had she loved me properly. I have also come to terms with my own selfishness. Not in being childfree but in the knowledge that I could not get an abortion because I would feel selfishly attached to an embedded fetus just to have my ""chance"" to ""prove"" that i'm a good enough person to be a mom. It's why I work so hard NOT to get pregnant. Because I wouldn't be doing it for the kid. I'd be doing it for me. And to me that's NOT a good reason to have a child or raise one.

Last night I laid in bed with my partner, our cat-son was in the bed curled between us, paw out on me back against my partner's chest. And as we laid in bed I started reading Lord of the Rings lore (poems) to the cat in a soft whisper while he made biscuits and purred. And my partner whispered to me ""I love how you're just reading LOTR Lore to the cat. You really can be so nurturing some times"". And I said "" yeah I can, but it's still not enough"" and he said ""yeah"".

 We both knew we were talking about the part of myself that hates neediness and vulnerability. The part of me that yells at the cat or has even smacked him (i'm aware how terrible that is it's not something I do anymore and that took a lot of work). Or the part of me that feels deep anger when I hear a kid screaming in the distance and just wants them to shut the fuck up. Or the part of me that gets EXHAUSTED when my friends' kids want to play for longer than like 20 minutes. 

I am nurturing yes. Very nurturing. I nurture my partner, I nurture my animals and I nurture my clients in therapy sessions. But I am not nurturing enough to be what I consider a good enough mother. And that is my mother's fault. That is the legacy she imprinted on me. That is the trans-generational trauma likely from mothers and mothers before her. And i've chosen to end that cycle.

 I (m48) was sexually abused as a young teen, old preteen by older schoolmates. My ""problem"" is that seeing an erect penis triggers a strong reaction. I avoid pornography for this reason.

Today the topic of pornography came up. Usually it is at work where I can dismiss it as unprofessional and go on with my day. But today, I was on a date. My date started asking me of my porn viewing habits over dinner. Many women have this concern nowadays, and dodging the question will be taken the wrong way. So I answered but she did not believe I do not watch porn and grilled me even more. Just thinking about porn took me to a not-happy place.

I tried to finish the date, but once I got home I had a depressive break down and cried for a long time in the shower. 

My date wanted to see me again and play tennis together. But I feel so awkward about seeing her again. She probably saw that something was not right about my reaction to her question and thinks I am lying. Just feeling so violated by the topic, because when it comes up on a date I cannot avoid it.

I have been experiencing a low self esteem in my all life. I had to solve many troubles before attacking this one. Now I'm ready to improve my self-esteem. But I don't know how can I do it.

For example, I don't know what is important. It's true time and money is important, but I don't care giving my time or money to people who need more.

Also I know I can out some boundaries. But I don't feel attack when people speak badly about me. For example, a gf quit me, and when she quit me, she talked badly about me : you have strange smells sometimes, sometimes you are away and you look stupid, I don't like handsome men, you are average and it's better, I have better sex with a previous partner, I have a high sense of hygiene, and you are too roots for me. But I don't feel offended when they say that, but I neither hurt. But people feel they can say anything to me, and it unbalance our relationship. 

I feel like I don't what is important and to deal when someone talk to me like this.

In my job, I'm fully respected, I think, and people are cool with me.

There are obvisouly more problematic problem, but at first, I want to improve small things before big things.

175,matterforahotbrain,1614105879,"today i found myself reflecting on how my c-ptsd healing work often goes through a cycle that looks like ""stability--&gt;flurry of activity--&gt;deep rest.""

a snippet of the past few days for me: my mother made a major disclosure to her mom about abuse in our family and i did my best to support her in that, i had some big conversations with one of my partners about safety, i helped with a training for one of my community organizations about crisis response, one of my friends had a major housing crisis and we mobilized rapid support for her .......... all good things! truly!

but also.... wow, what a convergence of exhausting trauma work. this all required the best of my ability to articulate my needs AND empathize without taking on other people's pain as my own AND give of my resources and capacity while maintaining my boundaries AND have healthy loving generative conflict. phewwwwww.  so much healing to hold and support at once. and so of course i woke up this morning feeling nauseous, dizzy, restless and disoriented. i have chronic pain, and with the way the weather is, my health hasn't been optimal anyway, but i knew when i woke up this morning that there was more to it than that. 

so i am remembering that healing work is often cyclical, that for whatever reason, this has been my experience in the past and it will probably be my experience in the future. a flurry of activity happens all at once, sometimes rapidly, and i do my best to keep up with my energy and what's happening around me, and then i have to take a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig rest. and then when i feel rested, i have a little bit of time to feel like i'm getting the hang of things before something big happens again. the more that i am able to honor this, and accept it, and listen to my desire to rest (as opposed to my learned habit of just going and going so that i am ""consistent"" in my output of work, care, etc), the more content i will be in my life. 

i wanted to write and share this with others because i thought, perhaps i am not the only one approaching the rest period of my healing cycle right now, and surely i am not the only one who needs to remind themselves to REST. what a funny joke it is that learning how to rest is an exhausting process in and of itself. much love to you if you are struggling with this right now. we will prevail.",CPTSD,cycles of activity and rest in healing,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lqppd9/cycles_of_activity_and_rest_in_healing/,1614077079.0

So, I went through a fair amount of trauma as a child and also as an adult. A lot of relational trauma, a lot of loss, and some abuse.

I have a friend, whom I’ve known since high school, that has always been open about her trauma with just about anyone. She also started therapy much younger than I did. She’s not afraid to share what she’s been through, and how much she’s grown from her past. I kind of admire her for that, she has no shame about what she’s overcome. She’s one of the few people I can talk to about anything from my past and I know I won’t be judged, I feel understood with her. 

I can’t share those parts of myself with most people though. When I make new friends, and an opportunity comes up to share a piece of my trauma I think to myself, “do I tell them this now? Do I tell them later? Do I never share this part of myself?” I usually like to wait until I feel like I know them better before I open up. But sometimes I never do, because it feels like it’s been too long to bring it up or the opportunity doesn’t come up again and it feels like dropping a bomb.

I’m not really sure what I’m asking here.. I want close friendships. But I always put my safety first in relationships. It’s scary to open up. How do you handle sharing your trauma?

its like part of (or all) of my conscious brain just runs away as soon as someone else shows up. i get dumber, i can't think, initiating tasks feels insanely difficult, let alone actually doing anything. 

i wasn't allowed to be a person as a kid. expressing myself, taking care of myself, eating, cleaning, asking for help, etc., i was mocked and/or punished for everything. the rules were inconsistent and changed like the weather- i'd be punished for something i was praised for last week with little-to-no explaination of what changed. 

so now i can't be a person around other people. people notice. i've been (not unkindly) called a robot on many occassions, friends jokingly asking me if i'm a real person. because i can't be a person around them. 

but i'm still in here when i'm with my friends- its like i got pushed to the back though. sometimes my head goes completely blank and i won't be able to think of a single thing to say, but other times i can think of so many things i want to say and do but the wiring in my brain has been roped off and covered with detour signs. i'll sit for hours begging myself to do anything, just get up and do *anything*, but i'll be stuck. 

i hate it. i'm constantly misrepresenting myself. i don't contribute how i want with my apartment and roommates-  on bad days, getting out of bed or leaving my bedroom feels like it could spark the apocloypse, let alone helping out with cleaning (especially bc i'm the youngest and have the least posessions,, think scott pilgrim vs the world, my roommates are wallace and i am scott). that's the thing that bugs me the most- i feel like my friends think i'm lazy, i feel guilty and spoiled. i have no expectation for them to clean up after me, and if it were up to me i would do 100% of the cleaning, but i can only clean when i'm alone. even at work, which causes problems.

I faced long term sexual abuse at the hands of my father who was also a narcissist/drug addict. My mother had BPD so this combination of parents resulted in me growing up in a very chaotic home. 

My survival/success(?) is a result of serious dissociation and refusing to acknowledge my home environment, thus focusing on good influences/people that could better my life. I say this because I know part of this fucked up belief about trauma/abuse is due to my other beliefs that I can just create a “better adult life” and not care about my first 18 years of life. (This also is not a good belief. Part of healing is being able to process past things, not just focus on the current.)

But now in my current life I have serious judgment for myself and others who struggle with abuse/issues “less than” my severe sexual abuse. (I also KNOW that everyone’s trauma/responses are valid and no person’s trauma is “worse” than another’s) But because of this immediate thought/belief/feeling, I think that I really isolate myself, cause more pain, and just feel straight up guilty. It’s enabling my own healing process because I just blow off other traumas/life issues because “𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘣𝘢𝘥”. Does anyone else struggle with this? I seriously fucking hate it and I KNOW ITS SO FUCKED UP AND WRONG. I guess I’m just wondering how others have gotten past this and really formed a new belief.

I feel a double sense of shame because what seems like an easy job to my non-triggered brain is something I just can't handle during a flashback.  I've been with this company for eight years and didn't really have any issues until shortly before the pandemic.  That said, it was also around that time that my job became a lot heavier focused on inbound calls and customer service.  Prior to this, my focus was higher-level tech calls and outbound calls, which are easier to maintain control over.  Also, prior to WFH it was easier to maintain my bearings.

The extreme micromanagement of these types of jobs (they track every second you spend on the phone, in wrap up, in the bathroom, etc and it has been much worse since WFH) combined with angry customers combined with the pandemic lockdown has created an unbearable situation when I'm triggered.  On the other hand, I can hear my mom yelling at me how I'm lazy and simply don't want to work.  That's absolutely not the case.  The flashbacks I get relate to a much more stressful call center job I had ten years ago and also ex-gay conversion therapy.

191,amaloretta,1614095867,"Hi all,

I have a question about a symptom of my trauma I've been struggling with.

I'm sorry if I mention a trigger that I didn't realize would be triggering. Please inform me and I'll fix it or delete the post or something?

I currently see a therapist, and what I described to him was, in his words, ""the perfect description of a trauma shutdown.""

Outwardly, a trigger--whether I know it or not--incites this shutdown. I become nonverbal, and I can't move. If I can move, its to harshly ring my hands together, pull my hair, etc. My therapist tells me those movements are my body's way to ""reconnect"" with my mind.

What seems to be happening is that my mind totally disconnects from my body. I'm given to understand that's a form of dissociation?

Most times, I may be aware of what's happening, but I still can't do anything about it. I tell myself to move, or speak, and its like my body isn't listening. It just sits there.

Its very frustrating and painful to experience, and can alarm and confound anyone that may be present.

Metaphorically, it feels like I crawled into a pitch black room to escape danger. After a time, I realize the danger has passed (or was never there to begin with) and I start feeling around the room, looking for the way out. But I can't find the door. If I do find the door, I can't find the key. If I do find the key, the door loops me back into the dark room. The only way I can get out of the room, fully, and return to my body, is to open that door and have it send me to a place I feel safe.

Theoretically, I think whats happening is the polyvagal reaction? My body goes into freeze-flag-faint? Its interesting because when im in this state it does feel like I want to faint. I become very heavy.

My therapist noted that one reason I may struggle to exit this state is because of hyperfocus, a symptom of my ADHD. I hyperfocus on the feeling/trigger, meaning even though I'm aware that logically I'm okay and I know whats going on, I struggle to escape the shutdown because my ""lizard brain,"" in charge of my fight of flight instinct, doesn't want me to leave the safe space of the dark room, because its safe there, right? Why would I ever want to leave?

These occurances can happen to me so fast I barely have time to realize what's happening until after its happened. So it's hard for me to react with a coping mechanism fast enough to stop the shutdown.

My therapist recommended that when I'm in that state, I focus on one small thing at a time. Remember: what does it feel like to move your fingers? You've done it a million times. Now move your left pointer finger. There you go, now turn over your hand. You remember what that feels like. Etc. Until I've established connection again with my body, and I've crawled out of the dark room where its safe.

Does anyone else experience this? Does anyone have additional advice on how they might have been able to prevent these shutdowns or how they got out of it? Any research you can point me to?",CPTSD,Trauma shutdowns?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lqloaj/trauma_shutdowns/,1614067067.0

She always wanted a show she could watch with her family or a Christmas tradition that makes you feel warm in your heart. She always wanted to sing along to movie songs like other families did with their kids or have nostalgia for something she enjoyed as a kid, and now I'm giving it to her.

196,lalunajess,1614092416,"One of the things I struggle with fairly regularly is acceptance of the abuse I experienced and a crippling cascade into self-doubt at seemingly random moments that can last for over a day at times. 

It is evidently an extremely common mechanism within the abuse cycle, since an overwhelming amount of the posts on subs relating to abuse are people desperately seeking validation that what happened to them was real. I strongly relate to their experiences when I read them.

Sometimes this self-doubt feels to me like my brain is numbed, almost *broken*? My mind clouds over completely, I can't think straight at all, and I'm overwhelmed by shame. I end up thinking that there must be something wrong with *me*.

Often of course it is deliberate, as our abusers tell us it's our fault; that we're making it up; that it's not happening. Sometimes it's even that within family systems negative behaviour and treatment can be normalised, which can be a big contributing factor to developing self-doubt.

I was wondering if any of you have spent a considerable amount of time thinking over why this is a consequence of abuse? I feel that getting to the root of it or understanding it could be really helpful for a lot of us here.

I was able to leave an abusive relationship about a year ago, though it left me with CPTSD. The main symptom that takes away from my life I’ve realized is my inability to form stable attachments and feelings for romantic partners. I’m trying to date someone now, but I can’t remember how it felt to like and date someone before the abuse.

206,bascelicna123,1614088181,"This happened a couple of weeks ago, and my parents are a good chunk of why I have CPTSD in the first place. My parents have a large rescue dog that I found for them. The dog and I love each other like crazy. Every time I've visited in the last five years, we were overjoyed to see each other.   


My mom was visiting me with the dog. He had given obvious indication that he was ready to go home a couple of times, but nothing to indicate what he was going to do. When my mom was ready to go home, I go over to the dog and cuddle him like I have 100s of times. He suddenly goes stiff, I realize something's wrong and as I pull away he lunges and bites my hand. No growling, nothing. It was so shockingly fast.  


He didn't break the skin, and the pain went away a few hours later. My mom stood there in shock, and didn't know what to do. She left immediately and I was devastated. I cried off and on for days. I couldn't sleep. I felt vulnerable and raw. I know that my reaction is out of proportion to what happened and I can't help but feel like I put myself together incorrectly. I came apart so easily. I felt shame and was disgusted with myself for feeling like I do.  


After suggesting to my parents that they need to take the dog to the vet to get checked out, they were hesitant. They also brought him to me again and I freaked out. They called me crazy for feeling the way I feel. I don't want the dog put down, but I do want my parents to take action before the dog does something worse.

I’m a painfully honest person. Especially when it comes to my feelings and well-being. If someone asks how I am, I will be honest. If I had to guess, I would gather my honesty is due to my father making me into an honest person and punishing me severely for even the smallest lie.

My father is no longer in my life, and with that a lot of traumatic events popped up in my brain, all of which have been confirmed with my mom. It’s lead to many a meltdown, and it’s been hard.

I had a really tough day and didn’t sleep all night the night before so i left the living room to get away from her and i just wanted to cry alone in my room but she would come into my room telling me to stop crying cause i’m acting like an immature brat and i snapped out and started yelling at her and crying while she was mocking me like she always does cause i felt helpless. 
So just to give you some insight, this neighbor’s dog wakes me up every single night barking so freaking loud and he also goes outside at 6 am talking extremely loud and cursing his dog or i suspect beating him and that only makes the dog bark even harder.

I’m so stuck between wanting to put myself out into the world and continuing to isolate myself because I don’t feel worthy of anything. I don’t feel worthy of anyone’s time or friendship and when I start to get comfortable I want to leave, and sometimes I do. (at least temporarily) I have very few social media accounts but the ones I do have I constantly debate on deleting because it really wouldn’t make a difference if I was gone, I don’t talk to anyone. I crave validation without displaying any sort of credibility to get the validation because I’m too scared to put myself and my creative endeavors anywhere.

Nothing I do is consistent because I’m so heavily embarrassed and ashamed of just existing as myself that I remove myself from everything to spare other people, even when there’s no evidence that they dislike me or don’t want me there. I assume that’s the default because that’s what I grew up with and how could anyone ever possibly like ME of all people? I make myself as unavailable as possible to avoid getting hurt and then I wonder why I don’t get interaction or make friends easily.

231,wanderer333,1614063699,"It's been a long time since I've visited this sub - I kind of shut down for most of 2020, just didn't have the bandwidth to focus on healing and was pretty much just trying to get through the day.  Which is actually still true, but I'm feeling trauma stuff increasingly start to bubble up to the surface, so thought maybe it was time to poke my head back in here, at least for a bit.  Reading some recent posts just now has been both overwhelming and validating at the same time, and I think I'm ready to ask a question of my own now, which I'm hoping maybe others will have some thoughts on...

Without going into too much history, I have a lot of attachment issues from childhood that have played out in friendships throughout my life - latching onto someone and trying to get them to ""rescue"" me emotionally in some way, getting more frantic and clingy as they push me away, etc until they eventually end the friendship.  Obviously this is something I have spent many years working on in therapy, and while I've gotten better at respecting boundaries, my neediness has ruined friendships as recently as a couple years ago.  I was in a lull between these intense attachments when the pandemic hit, and obviously there hasn't been much opportunity for closeness with friends for the past year.  So I've just been in kind of this frozen state, which I feel like is starting to thaw a bit and I'm starting to realize just how intense those needs for connection and validation and support still are...

Oh, and another useful bit of background info - I am aromantic asexual, so I have no interest in dating and really can only get these needs for connection met through friendships.  This probably compounds the issue somewhat, since I'm always going to be a much lower priority in my friends' lives than their partner, children, etc (understandably), and also a lot of dynamics that are considered inappropriate or unhealthy in a friendship would be totally acceptable in a romantic relationship.  Which is another rant for another day...

But anyway, to get to my actual question - I had a dream a few nights ago that really exemplified that longing for connection buried in the back of my head.  I don't remember many details at this point, but I think the interactions were similar to those I've had in reality with past friends, with me latching onto their kindness and understanding and just wanting more and more and more.  (Interestingly, the person I latched onto in the dream is not someone I've done that with in real life, but a fairly recent acquaintance who I've kind of sensed would be very understanding if she did know more about my mental health struggles).  I'm not sure that our friendship got to the unhealthy and out-of-control point in the dream though; mostly I just remember being present as my full self, being able to speak honestly about all the sadness and fear and loneliness, and being comforted... being able to cry onto her shoulder, being told it wasn't my fault, being told I wasn't alone.  

So waking up from that dream to the reality that there is no one like that in my life right now, and won't be for the foreseeable future, was rough.  I've been replaying it in my head since then, trying to get a tiny bit of that sense of comfort back, but mostly it just reinforces how out of reach that kind of connection is for me in reality.  And it also feels incredibly shameful somehow, like here I'm wishing for something that I know always ends in pain for everyone involved... something that I know is probably more about the unmet needs of my younger self, which therapists have told me over and over again can only be met by my own internal re-parenting and healing work, not through seeking a replacement parent figure.

But that's my question, I guess.  Where is that line?  Part of me feels like surely it can't be totally inappropriate for a person who's been living alone through the pandemic to wish for a hug?  Or for anyone to wish for comforting when they're sad, or for companionship when they're lonely?  But how do I know if what I want is coming from a healthy adult place, or from those younger wounded parts?  It *all* feels young and vulnerable, and also shameful and bad to even have those needs much less ask someone to help meet them.  And I don't even know how I would go about asking - it's like that kind of emotional communication isn't in my vocabulary.  But it's getting increasingly painful to be so alone in the world, to be so touch-starved, to be so disconnected... and I just don't know what to do...

Found out today people who live over 20 minutes away are keeping track of when we do or don't use a piece of outdoor equipment they (supposedly) gave to us. We haven't needed to use it but that's beside the point. Now same people are ""hinting"" at wanting it back. \[ETA They didn't need it, they have two others that are newer and ""better"" and insisted we take this one after we declined twice, so we took it to avoid drawing anything out. \]

We had issues previously when we first moved here with those people feeling entitled to a house key since they were upset we don't leave doors unlocked. (They do not have a key to our place). They don't like my ""no unannounced visits ever"" policy but they grudgingly honor it.Spouse has tried to tell them it's a super huge trigger for me- to be aware someone who has to drive 20 minutes to do so is tracking my outdoor activity or to have people (other than my own family of spouse/offspring) enter my home when I'm not here, or to have people just show up with no forewarning-  and I'm working on it.

I remember there was once when they pointed out how I kept dying in a different game and my brain jumped to ""stop playing, you're shit and are never going to be good at anything,"" and there was another time they made a negative comment on me making a theory about a show we were watching (they had seen the show already, it was my first time watching) and again, my brain just kept going to negative places.

I'm aware that I'm intelligent, kind, eloquent, etc., but it seems as though normal social adaptations I should have developed early on are missing -- the ability to connect with people without trauma bonding, making friends based on mutual interests.

It's complicated as to why it took so long but I admit I didn't try hard enough.  One session blew me away, even though it was for my cat, we settled on the weird I associated with his death, ""self-blame"" and I moved to a memory of my mother I'd never had before. But EMDR stripped all the layers of scabs and bandaids I'd placed over memories to keep myself numb and distracted. I felt pain, shame, guilt, fear, anger, disgust ... 20x more than I knew I could feel. It was clear to me I spend my time distracting myself or drugging to keep these emotions at bay. Codependent relationships to validate. Whatever keeps that pain away. (drugs are not hard drugs and in counseling, dont need advice at this time)  Afterward I was emotionally exhausted. I found out this was good and normal and meant it worked. I told my bf I needed him not to dismiss my emotions when I'm sad while I was doing this. He had been very unsupportive after an early miscarriage and I haven't looked at him the same since. Not angry, just literally said ""Well, that sucks, but it's over with so let's move on."" While I was still dealing with it. He initially was supportive of what I said after EMDR but slipped into a depressive state and went no contact... which sucked because my parents found out we're in an open relationship and went full on verbal abuse. Saying horrid name calling, and telling me I'm going to hell. It was the way they screamed it. Mentally ill type of screams, it made me realize I hadn't made up past times when they did this. I blocked them. Then I found out my brother has chronic suicidal ideation like me. And feels like a failure like me. Then my siblings and I started discussing things. But my bf and his mom are not talking to me. After the phone call btw, I made what my dr says was a suicide attempt, but it was mixing a safe dose of pills higher than i normally take, with an unsafe mix of pills. I woke up knowing my parents dont deserve my death. Talked to bf and things are in flux but at least he's not ghosting me, just I HAVE to not rely on him for emotional support. He literally told me he doesnt understand emotions due to being non-neurotypical or bipolar. I dont know what tha t means for us but I wish I hadnt been truthful about the pills because I dont get EMDR anymore.

250,cranbog,1614051210,"TW: disaster trauma

So I live in Texas. Our power went out last Sunday night and didn't come back on until Friday afternoon. It also was below freezing every one of those nights and for most of the day during the day. It would snow and sleet and we had 8-10 inches of solid frozen snow/ice mix everywhere. 

I didn't know how long the power was going to be out. We had been told they were doing rolling blackouts and that outages would only be out in 10-40 minute spurts. After a few hours we still had hope, but after two nights absolutely freezing with not even a blip of power, I had lost all trust that anything was going to improve. 

I went into full survival mode. Maybe you know what that's like after having trauma. You shut down emotionally and just deal with the task at hand. I didn't care about anything except warmth, food, and water. 

But the entire time, I had to deal with my roommates who acted like every action I was taking was unnecessary. Even when I ended up making things a lot better for us by having extra blankets, food for everyone, and water for everyone. I prepared, I kept our food cold without power, and I made sure we were all going to make it. 

They just kept worrying about whether fast food places were going to reopen or when they could play their games or drink beer. And they weren't the only ones, it seemed like everyone was treating it like a temporary thing, like they hadn't lost complete trust in the system. 

Like they weren't used to being completely forgotten. They had no idea what to do when the worst happened and they needed to step it up to survive. 

And I realized how much crap in my past prepared me for this. All the crap of growing up poor, all the traumatic events that made me grow up too fast. 

Now that things have turned back around and the worst is over, my emergency switches have flipped off and now I've gone into processing. I couldn't do that before, I had to survive. 

And, I mean, holy fuck, we almost died. If we wouldn't have done what we did, if we would have stayed in our house that one more night without warmth, which happened to be the coldest night, we would have frozen to death. We only made it by moving to other places that had had power more recently so they were still warm, even though they lost power too.

By the end of it we were all visibly dehydrated from having to ration the drinking water, and totally exhausted. I wasn't able to bathe for a full week. We couldn't flush the toilets. We had to collect snow for water to flush or boil. We didn't have a warm meal for a full week.

That just gets me completely riled up inside. I can't be okay with it. I can't go ""oh well, glad we didn't die, glad the worst didn't happen, haha!"" Because that was too fucking close. 

We wouldn't put up with that with people. If someone beat you to a pulp but you didn't die, you wouldn't just forgive them and be like, ""oh well I didn't die, back to work!"" 

It seems like everyone is just going back to their lives. They have resilience. They aren't just standing there stunned. 

The shattered assumptions theory has three parts. Healthy people who haven't experienced trauma will believe:

- The world is benevolent
- The world is meaningful
- The self is worthy

With CPTSD style trauma, we might be shattered on 1 and 3, for example, after long term emotional abuse. And therapy can help us reconstruct these, but they're fragile. 

Am I, like, suffering from a re-shattering of my world views? 

How am I supposed to believe that the world is benevolent when this whole thing probably boils down to some assholes wanting to save money who were content with letting us freeze to death? 

How am I supposed to believe that I'm worthy when there was no support for us in the worst of it, when we were turned away from a grocery store because they wanted to close rather than let us get some firewood so we wouldn't freeze to death?

I can't just pick up and move on. 

And I can't stand what I'll call the victim blaming, the people acting like any one of us who just suffered through this is to blame for what happened. Like we should have had snow shovels and enough firewood for winter in Canada when we usually only see like one day a year below freezing here, let alone a week and a half. It's weird to get 1-2"" of snow a year here that doesn't even stick, let alone a buildup of 8-10 inches of ice and snow mixed together and frozen solid.

I can't stand trying to get support from family and friends and they tell me some story about how it snowed a lot one year, but they had power and water and food and the stores were open...

When I think about how fucking scared I was in the cold, walking through the ice and snow to some other new place with my bag of dirty blankets and boxes of food I didn't know how long I'd need to make last...I just can't fix it in my head. 

I realized some of my favorite songs have snow or ice in the music videos, and it just brings on this sense of dread now. Or I was watching a cute cartoon with a snow episode, and it didn't feel cheerful and cute like it should have, I just went numb and stared into space like I do with my other trauma. 

I didn't need this. 

I do have a therapist but she's local. A part of me feels guilty trying to get support from anyone who lived through this. I know she's probably well equipped to compartmentalize her own experience and still help me through. But.

I don't even want to order takeout because I want the people who work there to have less to do and more time to process this. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.

When you reached out to me when I was 16 I was skeptical, but still very open to giving you a chance to prove yourself. You have in the last 4 years proven to me: (1) You show little to no genuine interest in my life, frequently only thinking to message me when you feel bad about something (a relationship, etc) and want to do something to make yourself feel like you have your life on track. (2) When I have attempted to share my thoughts, beliefs, and other personal information, you have always made a point to disrespect me and act like your way is better. (3) You are just as manipulative as anyone else in my family, quick to call other’s “crazy” when you are just as guilty. (4) Every reaction you have provided to any of my questions about my infant and toddler years as well as the time I spent with you at (Step mom’s) has been denial 101. You’ve not only tried to cover the truth about yourself, but also either (a) lied to protect (step mom), (b) didnt see her behavior towards as abusive because you are also an abuser, or (c) really were not fucking paying attention to me at all while I was with you. 

As a result of all of the above, I have decided that there is nothing good, supportive, productive, or healing about my continued relationship with you or anyone who might encourage me to speak with you further. I have not decided that you are “the bad guy”. What I have done and continue to do is give people who hurt me second chances. You were the very first one I offered that opportunity to, and this is what conclusion I’ve come to. I know you will try to argue and deny and gaslight me in response to this. I will not respond. 

I genuinely hope you can learn to function and be happy with your current family unit. I hope you can sort your shit out and come to terms with some of the things youve done and ways you’ve hurt us. It is not my job to explain what you did to you. As someone who has also been the abuser, I know that it is possible to figure that out for yourself.

A total lack of curiosity over what may be going on with me, ya know? My mother is like that too, always has been. It's one of the reasons I developed CPTSD to begin with. 

In the past, let's say even a year ago - this would be destroyed my entire day. But with the help of my support system and therapy tools, it only destroyed *part* of my day! I really really struggle with authority figures, and especially when people are unhappy with me. I feel like a burden and unworthy of everything.

Things I did that I'm proud of:

1. Resisted the urge to write an angry, defensive reply
2. Didn't lash out at my partner when she gently offered a suggestion (that proved to be helpful)
3. Didn't dissociate or self-harm. 
4. Said nice things to my Inner Child, including some visualization work.
5. Thought about why I am struggling at work and made an appointment with said boss to discuss it further (honestly this is what she should have done but whatever)
6. Attempted to feel my feelings

Anytime I even cried as a kid I would be screamed at, told I was faking it, told I was weak, told I was selfish. The first time I asked for therapy (I was 11) my mom told me i was pathetic and weak if I felt depressed and that I could only go If I payed myself and find someone to take me  (obviously I couldn’t, I was 11) 
After a suicide attempt at 15 years old my mom said I was pathetic and selfish and she just laughed at me. When I asked to go to a hospital because I felt like I would hurt myself again she took me to my grandparents house where she, my grandma and grandpa would surround me screaming that I was making everything up for attention and trying to make my mom look bad. She also told me I was possessed and that’s the only reason I was hurting myself. This isn’t even half of it but it’s a few memories that my head shoots back to when I have panic attacks or even anxious thoughts.

262,RawnExposed,1614045518,"Anyone else have a rapid resting heart rate? At first I thought it was due to adderral, which I've been taking for maybe seven years. But I researched it and apparently it only raises your heart rate by a few beats per minute. My next guess is that I'm stuck in fight or flight. I've measured my heart rate overnight and it can get much lower into ""normal"" range when I'm asleep. Sometimes.

I can almost always feel my heart beating. I've been sitting here for an hour and I would guess it's about 90bpm right now. If I run up a flight of stairs, the sound of my heart is so loud that I've thought I was hearing a noise in the house. 

For awhile I thought I was just out of shape, but Ive been using my VR headset to workout every day for at least six months and there's no difference. If its mild- medium intensity I'm fine and can do it for hours. If its higher intensity (running instead of walking, carrying something really heavy, or even moving with a lot of force when I play VR) , it's like any amount of that will leave me almost gasping for air, and feeling like I could pass out. 

Obviously, I should go to a doctor. But... I know it's going to be forever before I manage to get to one. And if anyone would understand how I both ""know I need to go"" and ""CAN'T go"" at the same time, it's you guys. 

I'm thinking about taking a short break from the adderral, just to see, but it's going to be difficult. It's prescribed for me as an anti depressant, and it's difficult for me to feel terrible when I don't have to. 

Tldr: heart rate is super high. Maybe I'm stuck in fight or flight?

267,HiddenSparkles,1614042183,"Seriously, how? How do we stop child abuse? How do we stop C-PTSD? I see a wealth of literature on therapy and on recovering from the abuse, but it seems like no one is interested in stopping the trauma from happening in the first place. If whatever supposed protections in place actually worked, this community (among countless others) and the trauma literature wouldn't be necessary. The system is broken; how do we fix it? 

I think the biggest obstacle is society's reverence of abusers and scorn of victims. When a victim speaks out about their trauma, everybody's first reaction seems to be to doubt them and defend the abuser. This is tenfold when it comes to children speaking up about abusive parents. Society glorifies and licks the boots of parents while absolutely hating children. 

Children are seen as evil demons who have to be beaten into submission (either metaphorically or literally) in order to be decent human beings. The ideal child is obedient, never complains about anything, and unconditionally loves their parents, no matter how badly they treat them. It's totally acceptable to hate children (how many people rag on about how much they hate kids, calling them ""crotch goblins"" and the like? Imagine if somebody said those same things about any other group of people; it at the very least wouldn't be as widely accepted). Children are the only group in society where it is still debated whether violence should be used against them; keep in mind that if you hit anybody else besides your own child, that's assault. 

Parents, however, can pretty much act however they want and still get their asses kissed. Children are held to a much higher standard than adults when it comes to behavior; if a child in a restaurant cries, they get punished by their parents and scorned by the other diners, while management kowtows to a Karen who threw a much worse tantrum. A parent savagely beats their kid and someone gets it on video? Apologists come out of the woodwork to caw excuses at you like ""I wAs HiT aNd I tUrNeD oUt FiNe"" or ""It'S dIsCiPlInE."" How many abusive parents actually get held accountable for their crimes and go to jail, anyway?

274,potentialia,1614037375,"33 yo make.  How should I go about finding a therapist?  I’m a survivor of childhood neglect, emotional abuse, csa (though it was not overt and I have few memories), gaslighting, and narcissistic abuse.  I am biased against social workers due to a family member who is one and after being abandoned and neglected as a baby they basically still wanted me to be irreverent of their own desires of what they wanted me to be and how they wanted to utilize me for their own ends.  Also, I worked in healthcare and felt a lack of superior level intellect in the social workers I dealt with.  I had straight a’s in premed for 2 years and have a high iq,  so I pompously worry a social worker won’t be able to help me.  I feel bad feeling this way, because in many ways these ppl saved my life, but they’re fake and bigoted and I am constantly triggered around them.  The lack of awareness of how to treat a kid who had been abandoned has made me weary of going to a stranger who got a masters degree, divulging all my most personal feelings.  So I thought I should look for a phd psychologist or psyd who specialized in ....adverse childhood experiences?  

The horror stories of medical people retraumatizing survivors worries me.  Also, having worked in healthcare sometimes the lack of empathy was palpable.  I worked in a toxic healthcare environment so I’m feel grossed out even going to one of these people for help with the chance that they may just manipulate me to extract maximum resources from me and my health insurance.  I, of course, have no boundaries because I was so repeatedly mistreated by  my caregivers.  I am overly empathetic and want so desperately to see the good in a people I give everyone a chance.  It’s as if I love everyone yet simultaneously am terrified of them.  This makes this stage of the process daunting and it’s making me freeze badly.

Are there certain strategies or processes these ppl should offer to me that I should look for as a good sign or bad?

This is what they said:

“You have posted this on eight different boards. That wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but your post contains significant misinformation about trauma.

You wrote,

‘I have so many other signs of CSA’

Actually, there is no such thing as a sign/symptom or set of signs/symptoms that shows someone was sexually abused. That is a myth that is all over Reddit, and it is very dangerous. People have mental health problems for all sorts of reasons and sometimes for no reason at all, and you can't work backwards from any symptom or set of symptoms to assume sexual abuse.

Second, it is considered very bad practice to go searching for repressed memories.   The very best way to develop false memories is to go searching for memories.

My advice is to avoid Reddit as a source of information for mental health. Read the APA link provided in another post in this thread. If you are very unhappy in your life, find a therapist. However, you should be very wary of any therapist who insists that a certain set of thoughts or behaviors ‘means’ that you were abused, or who wants to go digging for buried trauma. Focus on creating the life you want, and the therapy will naturally go where it needs to go.”

Today, my mother gave me again, a random sample of clothes that are not even of my style for my birthday, along with the cheapest type of earphones she could find. As she gave me the present, she told me that she explicitly asked the guy from the store if they were good and that he had the earphones she bought - seemed as if she was making the story up. She knows that I'm working out and that I like hearing music as I run, so she told me that they didn't come off as you ran, this was a lie. Am I bitter for thinking this way? I'm tired that, in every festivity or so, my family tends to just buy random stuff for birthdays and leave them there. Sometimes, those presents have close to no resemblance of the actual interests of that person; a reminder of how materialistic and detached from genuine interaction my family actually seems to be. 

Not too long ago, I had told my mother that I did not like that almost all the interactions we had were about if I want something from a store or that I need to do ""x"" chore; told her that this made me feel extremely sad and it was a clear resemblance of how detached we were from each other: She still does it everyday and she never wants to interact for the most part, she just sits all day watching tv and nothing more. Three weeks ago, I bought a chess board so we could play and she hasn't told me once for a match, all the times that we've played, the invitation has been started by me.

Basically, as the title says, the thought of ever having to stand up for myself to another person is exhausting.

I recently left my family home, where a lot of my abuse happened, and moved in with my partner.  I've gone no-contact with my abusive parent, but even that I feel guilty about and I could never confront him.  The other parent fills me in on him sometimes, and I really wish that would stop, but I get too jittery at the thought of saying ""I don't want to hear about this.""

I had an abusive friend living with me for a time.  Even though I am emotionally checked out from him for a whole host of reasons, I still continue to message w/ him daily (a process that drains me immensely) bc otherwise he gets upset, and the thought of making someone upset is unbearable for me.  I try to justify my anxiety around blocking and moving on to myself, by saying things like ""He'll message my partner and make it look like I was cheating (even though he's gay)"", or ""I'm opening myself up for violence"" or ""The messages of his that I find egregious but agreed with in-chat to move the conversation along will come out"".  I know all of these are bullshit and excuses, but I still can't find a way to stand up for myself.  The thought makes me anxious to the point where I start shaking and panicking.

i’m terrified of failing again, especially because this job revolves around housing justice - something i am really passionate about.

I was performing my duties as required by my employer, so any complaint he had should’ve been directed at a supervisor/manager. He chose to confront me.

I see him often and because I was incessantly bullied and sometimes physically assaulted as a kid, I go in to “fight or flight” every time I’ve seen him since. I’m not afraid of him. I would fight him if he ever attacked me, but I get all uncomfortable whenever he comes in, which is often.

He had another issue with me this past Friday and he called the store and spoke with the manager. He supposedly threatened him and the customer was still on the property at the time. My boss approached me and told me a customer had just threatened him because he was unhappy with me and I knew exactly who he was talking about. I told him I’ve had run-Ins with him in the past. (Another coworker who was passing by heard me mentioning the customer’s name, and he stopped dead in his tracks and turned around to say he had been threatened by him as well.)

The owner’s son was there so my boss approached him to ask if we should call the police. The son said he would talk to him and tell him he couldn’t come around anymore. This all happened around the time I was leaving for the day, so my boss asked me to take a different exit so I wouldn’t interact with the customer.

I felt better knowing I would never have to worry about this guy anymore.

But, the following morning; I learned that the customer had also threatened me! And to make things worse, my employer never banned him! I was livid when I found this out.

I have been there for 20 years and I told my boss and district manager that that day (Saturday) would be my last. I could not work in an environment where a customer can make threats to do physical harm to an employee with impunity. I told both bosses that I would confront the customer if he happened to show up that day.

Fortunately, they promptly contacted the customer and told him he could never come back. Supposedly the guy said, “What’s the big deal? I wasn’t really going to do anything. I just wanted to scare them”.

My mind and body was so flooded with adrenaline and I was staving off panic attacks all day. It was a long, busy day at work so I believe that helped me keep my shit together, but it mentally and physically drained me.

I used the black paintbrush to draw stick figures of my abuser and me in these memories that were burned into my skull. 

I've included imagery of things that I remember from my childhood, like the wooden spoon that my parents kept on top of my bedroom door frame. I also ended up remembering that my abuser often spat when he yelled, so I included that.

307,moonrider18,1614023155,"I think a lot of us get stuck on False Hope. Most obvious is the case where we hope that an abuser will change their ways if we just keep showing them compassion. (See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdDAHekq9yc)) But there are many other varieties, like overworking yourself for good grades and hoping that the good grades will be worth the sacrifice. (In my case, it certainly *wasn't* worth the sacrifice! I dearly wish that I had gone to a [Sudbury School](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155951019968804))

And I think we get the impression that False Hope is the only hope available. We think the only alternative is Hopelessness, which would be even *worse* than our current situation. So we cling to that False Hope, betting everything on the small chance that it's not actually false.

But here's what I just realized: False Hope has a way of crowding out True Hope. If you recognize that trying to fix your abuser isn't working, if you see the futility of your current path, then you can get *away* from that abuser and find a  *new* path. Likewise if you see that this school thing isn't working for you, and it's really quite futile in your case, then suddenly you don't need to beat yourself up about grades because now you can find some *other* way to grow and thrive (even if that just means calming down about your grades).

*True Hope is out there, people!* But in order to find it, you have to let go of your illusions.

311,thevoidisonline,1614022468,"I (23F) have been talking with my awesome therapist who, long story short, thinks I may have CPTSD and that I was not properly diagnosed as a child. She told me, in my case, it may have stemmed from extreme childhood neglect and something she called parentification. Before I left my session, she gave my some resources and a form with contact information of a specialist if I decide to pursue a formal diagnosis. 

But I'm hesitant to contact the specialist because from what i've heard, a symptom of PTSD is reliving the experience over and over and having nightmares about the traumatic experience, right? But honestly I cannot remember most of my childhood and even chunks of my teen years. It's kind of feels like a big puzzle with most of the pieces either missing or blank. And the few things I do remember is very hazy and distorted and feels like I'm watching a movie about someone else's life rather than my own, if that makes any sense.

Also another reason I'm hesitant to pursue a diagnosis is because, well, I don't think I had it too bad growing up. I could count the amount of times I was hit or spanked on one hand, because I was a pretty well behaved kid. Compared to some friends I had growing up whose parents literally beat them or kicked them out on the streets, I had it pretty good.

In comparison, my parents are separated and do not like each other, so they do not communicate well and as such have adopted different parenting styles. My dad mostly just ignored and forgot about me (e.g. forgot that I was there, forgot to feed me, etc.) so I kind of just looked after myself while I was at his place. As for my mom, I had to look after her, being the only child still living at home (my siblings and I have a big age gap). And when I say look after, I mostly mean emotionally. And while I now know that it wasn't a particularly healthy family dynamic, I don't think it was traumatic enough for me to say I have CPTSD or even qualify for a diagnosis.

I have dealt with so much personal trauma in the past year that, when one of my worst fears came true a few weeks ago, I felt nothing. I always expected I would flip out, have a meltdown, have to be admitted to a psych ward. But I just felt nothing. Genuinely. I remember crying when it happened, but it felt forced. I didn't want to cry, but I felt like I ""should"".

I also have OCD and I'm thinking, if anything, this is a great time to try ERP, since nothing is scaring me anymore.

326,CrimsonT-Rex,1614013161,"I have an older sister whom I always referred to as the golden child, it was so evident that as children when my mom told us she loved us the same we both burst into laughter as we assumed she was joking. Now my sister and I are older and don’t discuss our past because we do not agree on the things that happened to us. When we were children through to high school we would constantly discuss and validate one another’s abuse at the hands of our parents but once she was out of the home she began to refer to our beatings with belts as spankings – it was downhill from there.


My sister had a slew of abusive relationships over the years and when a girlfriend tried to burn their house down with her and her friends children in it she returned to my parents’ house. Around the same time she quit her job and started working at their store, I didn’t think anything  of it because I never thought they would continue the abuse.


To sing my sisters praises for a minute, she is a goddess in human form. She is gorgeous and will constantly be stopped wherever she is going to be asked out or told she is beautiful. She is also incredibly smart, the kid who took all AP courses in high school and once in college moved on to obtain degrees in engineering (I don’t remember which- sorry), english, and psychology. She is brilliant, she has an amazing sense of humor with a quick wit, and she was the girl in choir who got all of the solos. She can be a bit lazy because things come so easy for her and I swear to god she will be late for her own death one day, but otherwise she is stupidly perfect.


I say these things because I need you to know how amazing she is before I tell you that she is all but a husk of the goddess she was. My sister worked for my parents for over 10 years and was told every day to work in the back because she was too ugly to be in the front where she could be seen. She was told they would be firing her and hiring someone who was smart, successful, etc. She did fucking everything for them and they made sure she received no praise or acceptance for the amazing work she did.

I stopped talking to my mother and went low contact with my dad but before I had they would tell me every day how horrible my sister was and I would get mad at them and assume that was the end of it. I never thought they would be telling this shit to my sister – the golden child. They stopped the physical abuse but stepped up the psychological to new levels. I would come to work for them from time to time and when they asked I told them I wouldn’t work for less than I was making at my normal job ($22/hour) to which they agreed. I never thought to check with my sister but my parents had gotten lazy and had her doing payroll so she was able to catch that while we were both working full time, I was making $13/hour more than her. She did fight and eventually got her salary upped to $12/hour but it was only after she broke down when they told her she wasn’t even worth the $9 she was originally making.


Fast forward to the pandemic and my parents fired everyone so my sister was out of the job and on unemployment. I also lost my job due to the pandemic but I was able to start a new job in January where I found my new job had an opening for a position my sister would be perfect for. I told her about it and she had a breakdown over the phone with me. Thinking about applying gave her a panic attack and she told me she wasn’t good enough. If anything, my sister is over qualified with 8 years of experience and 2 pertinent degrees where they asked for 3 years of experience and 1 degree. I had to talk my sister down as I texted her boyfriend to get home ASAP (luckily she lives with him now and not our parents).


My sister and I had the same upbringing. We shared the same abuses. I thought it never got to her. I assumed she was so much stronger than me. I know my grandfather was my father figure as he raised me but my sister still looks to our dad as her father, even with everything he has done. I can’t imagine having that connection and being told every day that I didn’t matter and that I was worthless.


I know this is me rambling at this point but I just needed to put it out into the ether. I wish I had reached out more.

But one of my friends has noticed it getting worse now, and instead of joking about it, he’ll comfort me if i’m startled and apologize if he makes me flinch. It feels a lot nicer than I thought it would. Getting a hug instead of laughs is VERY nice and I wish it happened with other friends too. 

All my friends are well intentioned and they don’t really...realize that what they’re doing isn’t super helpful. I don’t hold it against anyone because they just don’t realize it. But I guess what I’m getting at here is please either don’t mention the flinch or apologize/comfort them when you can.

I was thinking if I should/could change the meaning of that day for me. Maybe instead of fearing it I could celebrate my survival by getting cake and blowing candles like it's my second birthday. 

Or would it be more effective to try to make it as a normal day as any and hopefully forget it as years go by?

336,LovieRose527,1614008866,"On the one hand, it's been productive for me. I learned that I have a Dissociative disorder stemming from early childhood trauma I was once unaware of. I was able to get local and cost effective resources to find a therapist to help me process things I've kept on the back burner for years on end. While trauma processing is not always pretty, it was a net-gain. 

However, I got laid off due to the lockdown. I got my first job in over a u year at the beginning of 2020 because I struggled finding work due to depression, not having a car, and trauma related issues. I had only been there for about 50 work days. I only worked part-time (20 hours a week more or less) because I was in school. I didn't accumulate enough hours to qualify for unemployment in my state. 

I got friends who are still employed that were complaining about the pandemic for different reasons. One of them in particular was annoying. I try not to be judgemental, but her constant nagging and complaining surrounding not being able to visit her friends (even though we talked almost every day and after two months of quarantine we hang out sometimes with masks on and 6 feet apart). She got to keep her job, pay rent, and otherwise be more or less independent. 

One of my goals of my last job was to save money to move out. I have relatives that are toxic and I wanted to move to another town because the small town I grew up in has a lot of my abusers living within a 5 mile radius of me. It's felt like a black hole that sucks everything out of me. 

Now my friends are complaining about trauma and abuse they endured within the era of covid and I'm struggling to put on the mask of being a supportive friend because they're complaining about and describing a lack of normalcy that is similar to a fraction of the layers of CPTSD that I've been living with every day. 

One of said friends even asked why I don't trust him and I had to tell him once again that I don't trust anyone completely. No exceptions. Not even the light of my life, I don't trust that he loves me as I am and won't leave any moment.",CPTSD,The lockdown has been a mixed bag.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lprkf6/the_lockdown_has_been_a_mixed_bag/,1613980066.0

Then there was the bible, teaching that feeling anger was the same as murder. Then there was being backhanded everytime my mom didn't like my tone or facial expression. And since it was that way the get go, i didn't know any other reality. So i separated my mad, my anger, my frustration, my hurt, and put it all somewhere else. I learned to keep a neutral face. To listen quietly no matter what was said. 

Now i'm 35. And in therapy, after delving the depths of the sea of sorrow i carry, taking down some of those inner walls, we discovered that under all that sad is this compressed layer of RAGE. Like... cornered raccoon, 3 year old throwing toys, tween girl on PMS, screaming clawing destructive i will chew your face off and enjoy it kind of rage.

I have a different personality for every single person I know, or meet. It’s like I become what I imagine they want me to be. At first I revel in how I can make other people like me, and often people become quite attached to who they think I am. They think I’m special to them, because we have so much in common and I listen to them. People often seem to trust me and share intimate things with me. I enjoy the relationship at first but eventually the act becomes extremely tiring and I don’t like some of the things I say / ways I act because they are not things I’d do in ‘normal’ circumstances (i.e. when I’m not pretending to be someone else).

I feel like they are getting closer to the ‘truth’ - whatever that is.

I have been wondering if I have BPD lately, because I experience the symptoms but it never really made sense why I would have BPD and my therapist has said it is unlikely as well. Recently I came across CPTSD, discovered this subreddit and I really strongly relate to other people's posts here, and I experience the symptoms for CPTSD as well. I did suffer from trauma when I was a child and the event has made me suffer for years, but it eventually ended and I am not bothered by it anymore. I had experienced long periods of abuse from parents, emotional neglect, as well as other things. And as of now I cant regulate my feelings, I hate and have always strongly hated myself, have a slight struggle with relationships, I dont know myself, and feel hopeless all the time, as well as having my opinion change on things and people randomly, and am really sensitive to what people tell me. The thing is, I dont have flashbacks or think about my trauma anymore, im more so living with the effects of it, and this causes me to wonder if I might be suffering from this disorder.

358,throwoverabridge,1613982847,"So a little background: I'm meant to be moving out of the house where I live with a couple of housemates. Been through the ringer with them (one seems to be more of a problem than the other) too many times. Finally gotten sick of being constantly anxious, walking on eggshells, being yelled at, not respected and just over their negative vibe they give off. So I've managed to line up somewhere to go.

The plan is to move by the end of this week, my partner is helping with the move and knows everything about how my current living situation makes me feel. We talked this morning and I brought up that I'm feeling like I need a few more weeks before I move. It's only been 2 weeks since I accepted a room at my friend house. I mentioned that I haven't told my housemates I'm leaving at the end of the week and I think it would be better to give them a few weeks notice. Especially because over the 2 years I've been here, their's and my stuff has become mixed up. So I want to give them time to move their stuff out of my furniture so I can move it. I also don't want to cause friction as I want the move to be a stress free as possible. 

I tell my bf all of this and he gently (but very straightforwardly) reminds me that I need to worry about me and not them. Because it's my life and I've been walked all over by them far too much. 

This has really struck a chord in my mind. I keep thinking about how I'd be discussing a situation with my therapist and she would say the same. I was trying to get my boss to give me breaks at work but was afraid to have the conversation. We'd role play a conversation at work with my boss and she'd pull me up whenever I said anything like ""I think the OTHER STAFF... "". She'd remind me that the conversation was about my needs. What *I* needed.

I just wanna share with you my thoughts for today. let me know if you agree or not.

I think people (including me) have been holding on their scars for too long.

This why Chester Bennington commited suicide back in 2017

he made song like:

Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real

Is good and it connects people but focusing on it, singing it, talking about the past just make you suffer while it gives you temporary relief.

And after people suicide because they express their pain too much.

Instead everyone should thinking on good things that happen untill it become deep rooted in their brain. The good emotions. no the bad emotions

Stop talk about your traumas. stop talk about your childhood. about this that your mother and father didn't love you enough or your brother hit you.

Talk about good thigns imagine good things and it will become your life. (see also the law of attaction)

Start to focus more on the good things that happened to me.

364,tryingtofixmyself2,1613979606,"Hi all,
So I've been struggling with my complex PTSD a lot at the moment. I did have an event that heavily reactivated my complex PTSD almost 1 week ago, though most of the symptoms seem to have died down... all except what appears to be hyperarousal and hypoarousal cycles which I was also struggling with for a long time before this event.
As a detail that may help, my doctor also thinks I may have chronic fatigue syndrome, maybe ADHD as well (but I'm going into hospital soon, hopefully in march to get my diagnoses figured out and treated properly, the complex PTSD has been confirmed though).

So to go into a bit more detail, my heart rate has been at 120+ bpm for years, although nothing abnormal has come up on cardiology exams. In the morning I'll wake up and for the first 10-30 minutes (approximately), I'll feel really motivated and calm, then I'll crash even if I spend it resting. For the rest of the day I'll be in a hypoaroused state, showing signs of a ""freeze"" state, I'll feel exhausted, overwhelmed whenever I want to go and do something, physically weak, anxious and even if I want to do something it'll take me about 10-20 minutes to be able to convince my body to respond to my mind. I struggle to do anything really...

Then when the sun starts going down, I'll start feeling panicky (sometimes it's closer to anxiety but some days it's closer to panic), I'll get a feeling that feels like depression but I wouldn't say it's actual depression, moody, agitated, I struggle to focus, I'll also get sensory issues (especially if I'm trying to read and there's background noise), I'll often also feel horrible about myself because I didn't get to actually do anything productive (again) and again I'll want to do something and my body responds more easily but I'll still be feeling overwhelmed. I'll struggle to actually pull myself together and at a certain point I'll finally feel tired enough to sleep. Then I wake up the next morning and it starts all over again.

I've tried using showers, grounding, meditation &amp; detailed to do lists with as many tiny steps as possible. I've also been trying to play some video games to get back into some hobbies but I'm even struggling to do that. I'm sure there are other tactics I've tried but am struggling to think of anything detailed at the moment.
The only time that this cycle changes is if I get triggered during the day, at which point, I'll go into hyperarousal for anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 or 3 hours and then assuming there's still daylight, I'll crash again until the sun goes down.

This is also really upsetting &amp; frustrating because about 2 years ago, I used to be extremely healthy (including going to the gym five or six days per week), then I crashed, I haven't been able to exercise (other than going for short walks since then) and I haven't really been able to bounce back yet. 
I have the motivation, I'm just stuck in this body that doesn't seem to want to work or respond properly

I just feel so confused. I’ve always been the mature or independent kid and person but mentally I feel like an 8-year-old. 

I’m 21 and I had to grow up at a young age. At 5 my narcissist mother made me start cleaning. It was only the 2 of us so I had to clean the entire place and she would cook from time to time but to be honest I mostly heated up frozen food. She had 2 jobs and also went to night school to become a CNA. Because she and my dad broke up when I was 4 it was only the two of us. I was home alone nearly every day except for the weekends I was with my dad and grandmother. 

Around 6-7, I also had to start helping to cook especially because I was sick of frozen food and it made my tummy hurt. I impressed my mother but she always wanted more from me. I would be beaten nearly every day. She made me be a straight-A student or I would have to face her wrath. 

I was also being sexually abused but I had repressed it. My cousins and my step-uncle did it. Sometimes it comes back in flashbacks but mostly my mother's daily abuse. She made me do the majority of the work when she had my brother, he was like my son. I cooked for him, took him a shower, taught him how to do it, and changed his diapers. We had a horrible relationship up until she kicked me out when I was 16. She constantly bullied me about my body and being useless. One time she blamed me for ruining her life because she got pregnant with me at 16. 

Fast forward to now I have own my place (with my husband). I work full time (currently was unemployed for a few weeks but start again in a week), I have been doing it since I was 17. I’m a junior in college and have one year left. I am leasing my car for the first time, I just finished one year's worth of payment out of five. Before this, I had a crappy older car with lots of issues but it’s much better now. I have fur babies, 3 cats, and a hedgehog that passes a few weeks ago. 

I will soon get my Bachelor's degree and become a Case Worker for children, survivors of abuse. It’s my dream job and my life has never been better. But mentally I still feel like a child. I break down easily with conflict, I’m very sensitive and cry all the time. 

I feel like my mom just broke me down. I’m not the same happy kid anymore I’m just a depressed adult. I always feel like such a failure. My aunt even told me I am less happy than I was when I was younger. I didn’t realize I was being abused so of course, I was happy. 

Just the other day I had a horrible flashback and just cried for hours. I just felt like a little kid again and hating my life because of my mom. I get anxious every day and stress out over everything. I overthink all the time and constantly have flashbacks. I can't allow myself to relax because my mom's voice is stuck inside my head.

And those shifts were permanent. My brain changed.
 
The problem is I was in such a dark place at one point, that now I feel perpetually ""good enough"". I think oh this must be happiness, because I'm not struggling like I was before. If I'm not happy, I'll, like, gaslight myself into being happy. When in reality my needs aren't being met somehow.

370,EyewitnessOfTheDeep,1613977904,"I was heavily abused and neglected as a child, eventually my parents tried to get me diagnosed with autism... it seemed fitting at the time because some of my behaviours did feel similar. The rigidity and social problems, and refusal to make eye contact. Although I never really had sensory issues. However I doubted that it was correct for me for a long time, nothing was done with those diagnoses until I moved out. Which I saw myself suddenly improving.  


A lot of autistic-related traits vanished, I became more connected to my environment and my issues then was morphed into abandonment related. I sought out multiple psychologists to assess me and they all agree that I was neglected, my issues were largely stemmed from trauma, and that if I grew out of these autism-like aymptoms then I don't really have it in the first place.

'Maybe you just learned to mask well enough to appear neurotypical to psychologists you met'... they all seem to think that misdiagnosis is not possible.

I started getting panic attacks and IBS in late elementary and was put on amitriptyline after I wasn’t allowed therapy.  Flash forward to now, I switched to celexa due to amitriptyline’s fatigue side effect after being on it for 6 years.

Amitriptyline eventually did the job and celexa has done it too, just in a different way.  No more panic attacks and my stomach feels alright.

While this has been nice, I also feel like my C-PTSD reactions and emotions are unnaturally numbed.  This is making it difficult for me to identify things I need in order to heal.

For example, alcohol or doors slamming used to send me into a panic attack.  Now?  Meh.  It feels like I should be going into a panic attack.  My mind certainly starts to immediately think about past events.  However, I feel numb and it just can’t happen.  I can think about past events and feel relatively unbothered.  But it feels so artificial and frustrating in a way, like I just want the real me to come out.

I cannot cry anymore.  I can think about situations that were extremely painful to me and I feel so blank now.  I stopped feeling anxious in general and just feel indifferent and detached from everything.

I feel like a fake in regards to cptsd because I am no longer experiencing a huge part of it.  I was recently formally diagnosed and feel fake because I really don’t experience the anxious part anymore in terms of emotions.  Yes, I am hesitant to do things like get in relationships and that does make me nervous, but I don’t feel the actual emotion of anxiety really.

When my therapist asks me to keep track of triggers or what causes anxiety, it’s a stretch to even find anything anymore because I simply don’t feel it.

Part of me wants to stop taking celexa just to see my natural state.  Am I truly not anxious anymore and magically healed from cptsd?  Or is it just the medication?  Is this how I am supposed to feel and should I be grateful?  Does this mean I’ve healed in the realm of anxiety?  

I’ve been on antidepressants for so long, I don’t know what is me anymore.

374,alupicard31,1613974891,"First of all, I have a history of really sucking at replying, it's not because of any ill intentions, it's usually because my brain can't work up enough power to write out a thoughtful reply. Regardless, I'm sorry if I miss your reply.

Anyway, I finally got a job, I started about 2 weeks back, and I went from sitting around the house being severely depressed to doing heavy lifting and long driving 9 hrs a day every day (not exactly a slow start), and it went better than expected. Sure I have things to learn, I've done a few mistakes, but all in all it's been going surprisingly good.

So why is all this crap still messing with me about work? To clarify, what happens is that first I started believing everyone hates me (which isn't unusual), and then I start to profusely apologize for every single small mistake I make (even the FIRST DAY) and I realized something:

As a child, dropping something, burning food, or doing any small mistake, resulted in me either getting screamed at for it, or actually beaten, so my theory is that this ""mode"" is just to make myself into the smallest target possible.

Now, I have no reason to believe that my colleagues would beat me, and I even know that if they did, I wouldn't back down, I haven't backed down from anything since I was 12 years old because of all this abuse (nobody gets to walk over me etc.) and when I realize this, my other ""mode"" kicks in, which is anger, being the biggest threat around, etc.

This is what I've realized, I only have these 2 modes, and I've tried desperately to find a middle-ground (confident, but not hostile, for example) and it's barely possible to stay in that middle-ground mode before one of the other ones take over. This makes it very difficult to function in a work enviroment.

To top this all off, after only one day of work, my brain started doing what it did for most of my childhood, it creates other realities, realities that give me some breathing room in the form of made up people who are kind, understanding, etc. Back when I was a kid, I did not realize this was happening, and it wasn't until relatively recently that I understood that I had been living halfway in my own reality.

Now it's happening again, but now I am aware that it isn't real, and I don't care. I think I am way, way more damaged than I thought I was, and now I'm having a ton of problems functioning at a job.

I don't want to lose this job, I so desperately want to keep it, I know it's good for me, and I need the money, but how is one supposed to balance all this PTSD shit whilst working? As soon as I'm off on a long-drive delivery, my social anxiety and ""survival modes"" go away, but then the depression sets back in. I'm on the verge of tears coming home after work, not because of the heavy lifting, but because of all of this absolute fucking shit that I am so tired of dealing with, whilst it also being the only personality I have (the CPTSD went away during the 2nd and 3rd day of work, and I felt absolutely nothing, I never had a chance to develop a real personality, like I'm sure a lot of you might unfortunately relate to).

I have no idea on how to deal with this, I was evidentely not really ready for work, but now that I got it, I don't want to throw it away. I just don't understand why I can't even put on a mask towards my colleagues, I'm just awkward and pathetic instead of just being relaxed and believing in myself (I have all the reason to, again, I went from sitting at home for more than 2 years to full on working my ass off)

I don't know, I also met someone on a delivery that really reminded me of one of my molesters (and she seemed to recognize me, I think I ran into her a few years back as well) which completely killed that day, only for me to find out 2 days later that another one of my childhood rapists (and who also severely abused me, like severely) has moved into my neighbourhood, he is for all intents and purposes, right across the street. I've been having ""religious"" experiences lately, and I can't help but feel that this is a test, I know it might sound crazy, but all of this happening at the same time as work, I really feel like I'm being tested. 

This weekend I spent in my apartment essentially binge-drinking and binge-smoking, just anything to numb it all. I feel like I'm staring into the abyss every day again, it's like being a kid but I'm actually a grown man with the mentality of an abused 11 year old, and I have no way of turning it off, even with all of my fighting experiences during my teens, all of the revenge, it's still just me and my abuse.

I wish I could get my day in the Sun with a revenge so sweet it gave you diabetes after reading this, but I know that's just a pipe-dream that not even Mario could come out the other side squeaky clean. 

I (31F) have had a lifelong episodic and drama-filled whirlwind of an existence. No one could ever say I was dull at least. But also no one else would want my life either. 

My parents in their late 50s haven't done all that well in terms of setting up any kind of retirement plan for themselves nor did they ever really care to do things that I thought were healthy for our family's future betterment. They always just kinda coast along, without much direction and often their big decisions really end up hurting their kids big time.

I have a sister who has done well for herself and was always self-sufficient, I am so happy for her in this regard, she's a strong pocket-rocket of a human being that takes nobody's bullshit and she truly fights for what she believes in. She's got a mighty mouth on her too that gets her in trouble quite a lot lol 

We grew up in the same house but we couldn't be any more different. I am the black sheep of the herd, the outcast in many ways, the one that never really fits in anywhere, the more dependent of us all and that fact became more apparent because of one particular traumatic event that would set aflame the hellish nightmare that became my actual waking reality. 

I'll launch right into it then and just say it. 

I was raped by my half-brother when I was way too young to even want to remember something so vile and demeaning. I get flashbacks of it quite frequently.

I internally dealt with that fact until I was 25 and decided, alright enough is enough I need to tell my Mum at least, cos telling my Dad, at the time seemed like the most awful thing I could imagine.

The person I was meant to not even think about twice in trusting. He took away my innocence, my identity, my dignity and my virginity all in one... And I didn't realise until much later on how and what all of that meant and why that affected me so deeply in all of the ways I formed relationships later on in life. In how I moved and weaved my way through awkward situations, in how I'd just try and constantly dodge and avoid conflict. How I had intimacy, trust and commitment issues. How just changing clothes in front of other people was a big deal. 

During 2020 man I went through the ringer, it was an emotional rollercoaster that just wouldn't relent. And nearing the end of it I thought I was gonna end it ALL. I'd had enough of my parents still caring for the rapist that is their son. But somehow in their minds even though they know what he did, it happened for them so many years ago that he should just be let away with it, WITH NO CONSEQUENCES, ""cos he was a kid too"", ""cos that's all in the past now"", ""cos he has a family and he's really a good guy now"", cos whatever the fuck... Well I'd like my parents to take ONE DAY in my shoes and tell me afterwards how much in the past it is then, when I am the one who lives with the consequences of his actions STEWING in the EVIL that he set upon my mind and my body. A LOT of 2020 was me having FROZEN UP... I was a Zombie that had no will to want to be better or see things differently. I was over everyone and everything! I didn't know what to do, where to go or how to react, I just became a numb nobody, with only sleep in mind and trying to get away from all the hurt and pain of the past... But I couldn't it was a neverending cold corpse of inactivity that I thought I'd never beat. 

Fast forward to today and yes I am better. Yes I am making moves in STILL recovering. YES my mindset is being redesigned right now so that I may be able to move on and *be strong* and do all the things that functional human beings do. But the thing is I SHOULDN'T have to be diseased by depression, PTSD, selective traumatic amnesia, and all of the other fucked up quirks I have as a result of someone else's greedy, selfish and truly heinous acts of violence!!! 

My parents have not been the worst people but they certainly haven't been the best people either. 

This situation is complex and was entirely exhausting for me to deal with last year and the beginning of this year. ALL I CAN DO THOUGH is actively work towards finding more independence and eventually just cutting them out of my life completely. They'll never understand or fight WITH me on this and the fact is they simply don't want to.

Otherwise they would have already... 

To all of the Survivors out there wondering if it does get better. It can! And it will! But it takes the willingness to WANT to get up and do something about it! It takes the willpower to admit certain truths to yourself! It takes the courage to cut out the toxic markers that exacerbate the problem (sometimes this is members of our family) and sometimes it takes a whole lotta nothing to amount to something, cos that's what last year was for me, not much of anything, 2021 however is my Recovery Year and I'm coming back with full force!",CPTSD,I'm Getting Stronger But I Shouldn't Have Needed To!

So, today I got word that my boyfriend's friend and fiance are moving to an area that I used to live with my abusive ex. From the way the area was described it sounded like it *could* be right there which triggered the thought that they might invite us over. I asked if it was on x street, and it turns out it's a good distance away from where I used to live.

Briefly, I thought that it was *remotely* possible that I *might* be asked to go there again. 

Now, consciously, I know that I could say no, and say that I'd be more comfortable if we all met for dinner or drinks downtown and everyone would be understanding about that. But, it's a non-issue because that's not where they're moving anyways.

So, queue something in my subconscious turning off clear vision for a while. I mentally make an effort to focus. We're not doing that today.

An hour of that and I make some tea and go into another room to watch some junk tv and try and relax. I'm only half watching and not using my eyes much. So, maybe we just forget to breathe on our own.

Practice breathing exercises while I watch tv, just like the CBT therapist says to do to relax. Now I'm breathing again...but what if...what if our heart just beats *really* hard now?

I had a very traumatic childhood where I was on suicide watch for both my parents as they navigated a violent divorce. Basically I spent my entire teen years indoors and had really shitty social skills since small talk became a burden for me, given that every topic is a trigger (Hobbies, Friendships, School, Family, Food, Games)

It's slowly getting better though. 

But I still struggle to recover from being ignored or bullied/criticized online. Criticism is fine, but a lot of people are needlessly rude.

The latest incident was when I posted in a Food-Review fb group that I didnt like Kombucha and rated it 1/10. I said that beer tastes a lot better. I've never had Kombucha in my entire life and it's nothing common (or affordable) where I live. A lot of people haha-reacted the post and made comments like  ""imagine comparing Kombucha to beer"".

I deleted the post but I still cant get over it. I feel like I'm dumb and defenseless. I chose not to engage and left the group. 

I see people post there all the time and some reviews are a lot harsher than mine. Yet a lot of people agree or find them funny. I'm afraid to tell jokes too or do anything I'm unsure will get positive reactions.

Be still with yourself, my child. Long nights beseech you and hail storms form above. I wish not to scare you; but only prepare you for what may yet to come. I know you, soul and heart, for everything you are. You shine brightly in the darkness. When harsh wind comes and deep frost bestows you, your roots remain firm and your earth is unbreathing. 

You know from where you come, though you try to deny it all. Your seed became planted in hostile spoil, but you became to adapt. Bask in the sun, every chance that arises. Dance in the rain or hold still in it’s baptism. Become who you are for the glory of what we have yet to see. 

Be strong, Little One. Continue to lead others toward the light, though even you can be prone to lose sight. You will one day be strong. One day be at Peace. Weather the storm, and do not give way, because land is before you. Enduring and structured. Not built upon stand, but that of solid ground.

If I were your age, id have been able to get that aaaages ago”) 

In asian culture, yes I understand tiger parents and low self esteem blah blah blah, I know it’s “normalized” in our culture.

But I am here to mourn that childhood.

388,dddulcie,1613966063,"TW: possibility of sexual assault 

I guess I just want to share my memories and my situation in childhood, and maybe some of you could share your thoughts on it? If you are triggered by sexual trauma, maybe don’t read this. It’s not very graphic but, yeah.

Okay for starters, I’m the only girl of 7 kids, my mom was a drunk/addict, my dad was a halfway decent dude. 

1. When I was in 4th-ish grade, I hit play on my VCR in my room to rewatch Josie and the Pussycats (lol) but umm, porn started playing. I ejected the movie and it was a porn video. It had to be my dads, based on the ages of my brothers at the time. On one hand I’m like, well there isn’t a VCR in my parents room and he just wanted privacy but also, I feel like it’s fucked up to watch/leave porn in your 8 year old daughter’s room. I remember this happening at least three times. Is this bad? Is this weird? Please tell me.

2. One day, around that same time, my mom walked up to me with a zip lock bag full of what I now know was cum. I remember looking at her and saying maybe it’s butter, lol. I remember my parents questioning whether or not my brother would’ve done that. I personally do not think he would.

3. When I was on 6th grade, I had a sore on my...lady parts. I was too afraid to ask my mom about it, but eventually it started to hurt, and I told her. She took me to the hospital and I remember like 3-5 doctors looking at it and wondering what it was. Then, I was sent over to the sexual assault center, where I was questioned for hours. I remember the doctors saying, “things like this don’t just come up out of nowhere, but if you tell us who did this to you, we can help you.” After like five hours of me saying nothing happened, they let me go home. I didn’t and don’t remember anything happening. I remember hearing that my herpes test was negative, but I have no idea if they ran any other test.

4. I remember when my mom told me I had to start wearing a bra, I refused for years. I was ashamed of my chest and did my best to hide it. I have no idea why. I remember my dad poking fun at me once when he hugged me before school and felt my bra on my back. My mom even had a doctor talk to me about it, who like totally shamed me for not wearing a bra. This went on from 6th-8th grade before I finally just gave in. 

5. In high school, I started dating boys. I’d date them for weeks and refuse to even kiss them. They tried and my body just pulled away in panic.

6. Eventually I was at a party and a girl kissed me. It was like, oh okay cool, I’ll let a girl kiss me. I’m 28 now and still have only dated (or even kissed) girls, which I’m fine with. 

7. Sex usually makes me uncomfortable. I don’t mind doing things to other people but when they do something to me, I just force myself to try to be normal and let it happen

However last night, my girlfriend and I were ...y’know. I started getting this urge to run away, to stop her, I couldn’t tell if I wanted to cry or puke, but I didn’t feel right. Eventually I just jumped off of the bed and ran to the bathroom and started bawling. I didn’t feel like I was in the present, I was somewhere else. My girlfriend was trying to calm me down and talk to me and I kept jumping because I thought she was someone else, but I don’t know who. I was in a flashback but had no visual. I remember just crying and finally saying “I think something bad happened to me.”

Today I was watching Netflix and there was a sex scene and I had to turn it off immediately. I’ve been pretty dissociated all day. 

I mentioned most of this to my therapist in the past, and we never spoke of it again. I think she just knows my window of tolerance and assumes I will bring it up again when I’m ready. We really have to tip-toe through my memories because I tend to dissociate big-time, I’ll lose hours, etc.

I've been feeling great and recently made a bunch of breakthroughs with my healing, realizing the source of a lot of my mistakes in my personal life and running an activist organization.  The more clarity that I've gained, the more I've realized a ""friend"" I met through activism is an extremely toxic, manipulative person.  I've been putting off hanging out with her because I was angry when I realized how many times she's done selfish things and hurt people...and then I hung out with her yesterday because I figured I should make a real attempt at confronting her on these things.  She's been having serious, overwhelming health problems and I feel a mixture of pity and revulsion for her.  I know her selfishness comes from trauma but she seems to have no interest in working through her issues or taking my advice, and she seems to feel no remorse for any of her mistakes (some of which have traumatized people).  I'm not going to try to rescue her.  She's never shown me a fraction of the sympathy I've shown her, and tbh I feel like she's taking advantage of me and treating me like an emotional dumping ground.  She asked me about hanging out again and I'm dreading it.  

I feel bad about cutting her off, but I was in a similar position a couple years ago (early in my recovery from addiction and an abusive relationship) when an old friend started keeping me at a distance because I kept having emotional outbursts.

410,timelesstaxi,1613951585,"Over the years I have continuously struggled with questions and observations from others around me. And I'm not talking about in class from teachers or even in therapy. I think it's because I was accused of lying and being overly sensitive so many times by my abusive mother. It may also be related to my ongoing battle with being a people pleaser and having low self esteem.

For example I had a coworker comment on my bag and say he liked it. I immediately explained where I had gotten it. He giggled and said he just liked it and that I didn't need to tell him where I got it (he was truly being complimentary and kind). It's hard for me to just say, ""thank you"" without justifying the compliment.

Another one was when I was in a school play where I was playing a character going through a horrible experience. As I was rehearsing with my scene partner we were giving each other ideas. I kept looking up at the ceiling instead of maintaining direct eye contact because I was scared I was going to cry. I looked at him during dialogue in the play, just not when we were casually rehearsing. My scene partner kept bringing it up and saying how strange it was. I'm not blaming him because it probably seemed strange from his perspective. It was just really, really draining to keep redirecting him back to rehearsal without having to explain that I felt overwhelmed emotionally. I was trying to channel it into the scene.

I think some people see me as being disingenuous or even lying when I try to overexplain as a explanation to an innocent question or observation. I just feel really really misunderstood and I panic when I think I need to just explain a bit more to make people see where I'm coming from.

Whereas my previous therapist would try an intervention after giving me a minute to stew in silence, new T just observes me as I stare off. Doesn’t interrupt. As I’m visibly shrinking and avoiding eye contact, T explains that even if I have no thoughts or language, I’m still processing something.

T is right. Internally I’m struggling with multiple conflicting emotions simultaneously (parts of me are legit fighting a war inside, but I don’t become aware of this until the next day). I’m completely hostage to this emotional process without having access to words or cognition for looooong stretches of time.

Do people commonly have auditory hallucinations after being triggered, or  having a flashback? I started having auditory (and only visual once)  hallucinations about 4 months ago and they seem to come either hours or  days after I've had a trigger or dissociated.

In my last relationship and most intimate experiences with men, I found myself avoidant and moody, often crying after hooking up, quietly next to them so they wouldn't notice. My ex made me feel broken because I was uncomfortable having sex with him a few months into our relationship. I was convinced I was, and that every intimate experience I had would leave me upset because I'm easily triggered by intimacy as a whole.

After a fun date with the person I've been somewhat casually dating for about 6 months. I was under the impression that I felt more comfortable with him because I was ignoring something. I came home to some messages from a guy who I had been seeing on and off previously and someone who was currently interested in me and both of them triggered me into a 4 day flashback and that's when I realized that I'm still reactive to things, but this guy I'm dating isn't giving me anything to react to.

Although I'm the common denominator, the problem isn't necessarily with me. There's always something specific happening, whether I realize it consciously or not, that makes me uncomfortable. I shut down and get upset if I feel objectified and that my needs aren't being considered. While my reactions to these things may be stronger than from the average person, I'm not uncomfortable with intimacy by default. I'm uncomfortable with how most of my partners treat me.

When my mom and dad divorced my mom met a new man. Long story short, we where abused mentally and physically. This lasted for 8 years, which is quite some time. Especially in a period where you develop yourself. So, 8 years later we finally had a chance to get into safety and start a new life somewhere else. I didn’t had anyone to talk to really. I was very insecure about myself which caused many problems. Some how I did manage to finish high school. When I turned 15 I started smoking cannabis frequently. Mostly due of trying to look ‘cool’ and my friends back then did it and I didn’t want to stay behind. I didn’t really enjoy it though. The first major panic attack started because of this. I can also remember it made me scared for invincible things. Like being alone made me very uncomfortable. Also sober, but less. When I was around 18 years old I tried magic mushrooms which caused another major panic attack. I started to fear things about losing control. A few months later it went really down hill and I wasn’t able to go to my study anymore due of the very high anxiety I experienced. I did went out to get help then. I did therapy for 2 years. Looking back, I wasn’t on the right place over there. We just tried a few things here and there and it wasn’t just enough to make me improve. It actually went worse. I did try EMDR as well a few times, but I didn’t gain anything from it. After that therapy stopped I became really isolated. Taking bustrips, going to friends etc. where all not possible anymore. Just a simple walk became a incredibly hard task. I started to worry more and more. I think I developed ocd related stuff. I started to fear more and more anxiety to hurt people. I started to fear I was a completely horrible and crazy person who shouldn’t be aloud in society. I started to fear certain colors and numbers  as well. My only task was to fight to not get crazy. The way I tried this was via avoiding. My social anxiety was sky high. I didn’t feel comfortable around anyone. Like I thought I could make normal conversation so was I was doing everything to stay away from anything. I felt so far away from society I couldn’t even watch tv anymore. I feared being schizophrenic or at least paranoid. I started fearing anything that I could relate to dark and losing control. After a year living like this I finally went to therapy again. I had to wait 1 year for this because of the waiting lists we have. It was entirely focussed on exposure. Long story short, doing exposure wasn’t the thing that helped me. It was also a program for just 3 months max. Luckily they did help me find a continuation and I met my personal coach (I don’t know really how to call it, but he isn’t like a therapist). We talk once a week and we go outside once a week. Overal it’s very hard. So lately (going back to the beginning of this post) we made a timeline and I told him most about the stuff from the past. 

Anyway, so now my question is, does my past have much to do with how I feel right now? I haven’t told everything and I let many details away in this post, but can my fears and stuff I deal with today be related to trauma? I try to find connections between the fears I deal with and my past. Many things I can’t really find a direct connection with. I must state another thing, emotionally I feel very ‘stuck’. I basically feel like a big sponge which is entirely soaked and I can’t wring it out. I feel very suppressed. Often I completely freeze in horrible feelings. I also wrote the things down that I feared a while ago like they are all past related, but I still deal with all of them. So, I don’t have any flashbacks about the abuse. I do have stuff that comes very close how I felt while having a anxiety attack with drugs.

TDLR; This is the letter I sent last night to my former close friend and boyfriend's former best friend whom sexually assaulted me while I was asleep a couple of months ago, and although my partner and I tried the best we could to salvage whatever we could to get closure for both parties, I couldn't ignore the pain and lack of empathy anymore. I replaced names with descriptors.

P.S. I will not be giving any further context beyond this. I just wanted to share since I'll never get the validation from him and I'm damn proud of doing this for myself. Here goes, and if you don't agree then pls just move on and leave me alone without feeling the need to personally message me, it would be very much appreciated.

Hello,

Our last interaction didn’t go so well. I’m not sure why you felt the need to deflect my polite and honest efforts to express to you just a *small fraction* of what I’ve really been going through, by only responding with a one-liner of, “Take all the time you need.”- but your lack of empathy, no matter the level of intention, was hurtful. Throughout this process, despite my level of guilt, shame, discomfort, and the painful burn of betrayal you’ve put me through, twice… I tried to be as polite, considerate, and grateful as possible for whatever bit of *basic human kindness* and interaction I could get from you (Not counting of course the 2 messages that I didn’t respond to during the holidays, can you blame me for not wanting to talk to my sexual assaulter during Christmastime right after he stood me up at my apology?). However, the truth that I need to fully and ruthlessly admit to myself is: one of my closest friends sexually assaulted me while I was asleep and without regard for my health, safety, and consent.

Recently, hearing your former best friend, and my life partner open up to me about his feelings towards you, the resentment, anger, and annoyance about your actions more specifically- helped me realize that I deserved a substantial amount more effort, empathy, and consideration from you throughout this whole process. I really thought you were my friend. Before you assaulted me, and no matter how disappointed I was, after you assaulted me too. I don’t know why I had such an intense desire to want to fix things after what happened and give you the benefit of the doubt as much as I did, but it was definitely an energy vacuum. I loved you as a close friend, I love your family, your brother has been a close friend to me since before you and I ever met, but I cannot repair the rift you tore based on this amount of little effort and empathy you have to offer.

I understand if you just need time or whatever you need to do to change in order to relieve the guilt you’ve accumulated for yourself. I also understand if you really are trying and you just can’t provide the amount of effort, time, accountability, and empathy that I needed for you to overcome this like the friend your empty-feeling words promised me you were. The honest, yet sadly brutal truth is, you never listened to my words or made me feel like you did. You never validated the pain you put me through. You put up unbelievable concessions and standards for me to meet, just to get an apology from you in person (because you insisted and refused to apologize properly over text otherwise), and you didn’t show up because you, “overslept after an after-work nap,”? Time, and time again I tried to put my best foot forward and forgive the hurt, disgust, and pain you put me through with your mistakes. My partner and I had every right to physically hurt you, berate you, or cut this friendship off much sooner than we have after that night you betrayed us.

I suppose you might be thinking what you could have even done to repair this, and that would be a good question. A question that I don’t have the exact answers to, but I can give a quick synopsis of. As a friend, I expected you to try to put effort into providing me a space where I felt comfortable expressing the hurt and painful experiences your mistakes put me through. I expected you to be considerate, but you weren’t when you gave me troves of self-loathing script that no victim would want to listen to on the first day we confronted you. By the way, as a friend, I expected you to be honest and remorsefully approach me *first* about the mistake you made that morning, on the day-of, but you left it to me to clean up the emotional mess you left and my partner had to confront you in the car as we took you on the way home. Would you have ever said anything? As a friend, I expected you to apologize respectfully and thoroughly without me having to confront you to even contact me again after 22 days, but I had to do that too, didn’t I? As a friend, I wish you took more time to actually listen *and respond* to all the things I had to say, and not just check ‘contacting me’ off the list and move on. As a friend, you have disappointed me very deeply and I’m done feeling guilty for it. We are no longer friends. I do not wish to speak to you, see you, or interact with you again. The disappointment and hurt you’ve caused with your inaction and mistakes, although largely excused by me until thus far, will never be forgiven within your presence or with you in my life at all.

Since this is the last time you will probably hear from me in our entire lives, I need you to read and learn about what your mistake cost me. I don’t want your validation anymore, I don’t want your sympathy anymore, I don’t want your empathy anymore, I don’t want a real apology anymore, I don’t want anymore promises to, “change,” that never meant anything to me in the first place. I just want you to listen to the last thing I have to tell you. I want you to read it without you thinking about hating yourself, without deflecting, without allowing yourself to look away, without an excuse to beat yourself up. I guess, I just hope that this will never happen again because you learned the cost of doing it. I want you to see this story as objectively as you possibly can. I need you to learn about all of the brutal things that were a result of what you put me through because of your assault that I wanted to tell you, but was always too afraid of you rejecting my friendship for if I told you.

That night, I woke up groggy and tipsy wondering (or really hoping) if it was my partner who was also next to me that was giving me the pleasurable sensation I was feeling on my chest. I reacted to these sensations before coming to the realization that it was you. I enjoyed it, I felt horrible, I felt like a cheater, as far as I was concerned I am a cheater, I didn’t know how to stop you, but it also felt good and it felt like a betrayal to myself and my partner to even remotely enjoy it in the moment. Then you started grinding on me. Thinking about it makes me feel disgusted and hurt. I was so afraid to stop you, I wasn’t ready at that time of night to process and strategize how to get you to stop without being a bitch or making a scene and I was scared. I stopped you when you tried to reach into my shirt because that was a point where I knew I could not let you cross at all costs. I’m even angry at myself for being so pathetic as to put your hand back in its place below my ribs where it should have never left, as if nothing happened.

I woke my partner up and told him what happened when you went to the bathroom after me. But you know what I told him because I still couldn’t process the truth, reality, and gravity of this situation? It’s so sick and I feel disgusting, but I basically told my partner, in the most pathetic desperate voice, that I cheated on him by letting you touch me after I woke up, and I started begging for forgiveness. (A part of me thinks that's what YOU think happened too deep down, based off of the efforts I’ve seen). That’s what he first heard waking up, and I had to deal with his misplaced anger at my “cheating” (more like ineptitude to communicate that I had been assaulted) for hours while I sat right next to you until I could express the words and realization he needed to hear in order to understand that you hurt me.

For at least a week after that day, I was repeatedly having flashbacks of that moment. I know they were flashbacks because I’ve had an actual form of PTSD since before you assaulted me due to other, equally and more horrible things I’ve been through other than this, and that’s not even mentioning the 2 sexual assaults I went through before *you.* That’s actually part of the reason why I had to go to the mental hospital so many years ago, and that’s why it’s been so hard for me to get access to the specific (and expensive) professional resources I probably need to really overcome this like I should. Anyways, I couldn’t stop dissecting the situation at every angle to blame myself for your decision to touch me while I was asleep and my actions leading up to it. I also couldn’t shake the terrifying question of how long you were touching me before I woke up. I couldn’t comprehend why you would do such a thing, I thought maybe you thought I was awake (which would still be bad but.. less?) I thought, maybe I’m actually lying about this whole thing and I asked you for it, maybe some things I said before we went to bed gave you a cryptic message that I wanted you to touch me, maybe I was sleep talking and I said something that made you think it was okay? The excuses I was able to rack up to defend you and vilify myself were endless. To this day, when my partner touches me in certain ways or areas and I feel pleasure, I get a flashback of a moment during your assault, and the pleasure my partner is giving me, turns into an uncontrollable physical sensation of discomfort and disgust on my breasts and I have to stop it all. Just so you know, I’m not being dramatic, and my flashbacks aren’t like ‘in the movies’ either. They are real, raw, and painful experiences that constantly bring me back to the mindset, emotions, perspective, and disgusting physical sensations that I was going through when you were touching me, and betraying the very basic level of trust that we put effort into building together. I’ve self harmed this week with scissors that were supposed to cut eyebrow hairs, made suicide plans just incase I got enough courage to do it. I can say so much more but I’m tired, and I don’t owe any more energy than I’ve already given.

Another note, what was going on in your mind when you asked me if you could stroke my hair after my partner left for work that morning and hours right after you sexually assaulted me? What sick fantasy did you manage to dilute yourself with that allowed you to think asking to touch me ever again was remotely okay? Questions like the ones I asked in this letter will always be swirling in and out of my head for the rest of my life, probably. I wrote down some of these questions on a notecard to ask you during the meeting we were supposed to have one day, but they will never be answered. This letter, and the contents in it are not just things that I wrote down to vent or make you feel bad, I could have just made you feel bad months ago. It is a true and brutally honest testament to the disappointment, betrayal, lack of empathy, shame, and pure disgust I’ve been experiencing over the past 4 months along with the mental health struggle I was already trying my best to cope with before this trauma was added to the list.

I want you to forever remember that as I have just displayed to you the true power of taking the time and effort to write my words and express this much emotion to you, you could have just as easily done the same.

Very Sincerely,

Me.",CPTSD,A letter to my former close friend that I just want validation and support for,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lp8lmj/a_letter_to_my_former_close_friend_that_i_just/,1613918479.0

425,oceangirl93,1613946524,"In my experience with healing, I have found a lot of valuable information from the Body Keeps the Score and the polyvagal theory. These theories address how bodywork/nervous system work are paramount to healing. CBT and talk therapy for the most part didn’t do ANYTHING my developmental trauma/CPTSD, and actually made my condition worse. EMDR, for me personally, was the same, and didn’t touch the core blockages of my trauma (not to say that’s the case for everyone, as I know it can be very influential to certain people.) But from what I’ve experienced, complex trauma can occur over a variety of different contexts, conscious and unconcious, and needs to be addressed as such and not through solely conscious memory. In my experience, my nervous system, aka (fight/flight/freeze mode) has had to be stabilized and regulated (through somatic experiencing techniques, nervous system regulation, biological/neurochemical stabilization which can be done through medication or holistic supplementation or diet) before therapeutic healing has truly been effective. When regulated, more innovative and holistic work like parts integration (from the Internal Family Systems technique,) coping skills (pulled from dialectal behavior therapy,) and energetic/relational boundary work (from my own research,) have been the most effective for me. I haven’t had consistent therapeutic access to these resources but have done a lot of homework in these areas and I just wanted to share, because I know that so many of us get stuck in traditional therapy methods that are outright harmful. There isn’t one size fits all, and to each person different techniques are useful, but I wanted to share my experience for people in similar ruts.",CPTSD,My experience with healing,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lp8cly/my_experience_with_healing/,1613917724.0

However I have a tendency to hate therapy. To hate the fact that I need it, to hate the fact that it doesn't give apparent and more rapid results, I hate that I have to pay with my money for someone else's mistakes. I more recently have hated having to start again and again with therapists because they end up leaving me for whatever reasons. 

I've had anger outbursts at the therapeutic process that has scares off several therapists. I've had issues with paying for sessions on time because I've been unemployed and money has been an issue, and this has led to several therapists not wanting to prioritise me and leave me. I've had some therapists leave when I feel suicidal and they think they cant handle me. And more. 

I've lost hope now in therapy. I don't think it is for me and the world has told me so. I'm lost and resigned to this being my life but I'm going to at least have to try and reach my natural life span. I may not be enjoying it but I'll keep moving forward even if I have to crawl.

I was friends with them until I was around 14-15 because my mother isolated me from them. Yesterday I spent some time crying about it and honestly it still stings. 

I used to spend a lot of my holidays, weekends, free time at their place or they'd come to my place. We'd have long sleepovers and it was so fun. My inner child misses these sleepovers a lot honestly. We'd play video games, go to restaurants, go swimming, paint our nails, bake stuff, play outside, go to the mall etc etc. It was so fun. 

But when I turned a teenager. My abusive mother started putting poison in my brain, told me my friends weren't good for me. Etc etc and I believed her. So eventually I started to drift apart from these friends. This happened with other friends I hung out with as well. I remember my abusive mom telling me that these other friends I had were weird and that I shouldn't hang out with them. Etc etc. This barely scratches the surface with the amount of abuse she's done to me. But I just wanted to come on here and share this story today. I don't remember much but I ended up acting out, my other friends got sent to the principal's office and afterwards we were no longer friends. I was left friendless essentially. I was no longer friends with these 2 sisters and these other friends I hung out with. 

I fell into a deep depression and became increasingly anxiety ridden, started spending more time in my room, online, playing games or whatnot. I made online friends. But my abusive mother also put poison in my brain and kept telling me that my online friends weren't real. So I believed her and lost contact with them as well. This all happened when I was 14-15.

He brought very little to the table (went through dozens of jobs, routine screaming tantrums, etc.) while dictating everything from the food we ate to how I wore my clothes. My mother totally and unequivocally supported his every whim despite a mountain of evidence indicating that he was unqualified to manage a lemonade stand. He predictably arranged the household around his interests, isolated my mother from anyone who would intervene, and destroyed household finances. I believe that he viewed me as competition and a lot of his abuse towards me was under the guise of correcting a difficult child. My mother eagerly agreed and continues to stand by him (some 25 years together). She claims that he’s some misunderstood genius à la “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” She chose him over me in every capacity.

I’ve been estranged from both of them for years and my life is better for it. However, I’m finding it really difficult to comprehend  how a mother could parent an adult at the literal and figurative expense of her biological child. I get that it’s dysfunctional and borderline perverse, and that it’s deeply impacted my own ability to date/trust partners.

439,Icy-Ad-9567,1613936079,"First of all, I'd like to give a disclaimer that this happened almost a decade ago, and my memory of what happened is a bit spotty in places. This is everything I remember to the best of my ability:

When I was seven, a therapist that I was seeing did some questionable things. It started with her basically trying to control the amount of toilet paper I used. Then she wouldn't let me lock the door when I used the bathroom and started watching me use the bathroom. This progressed to her one day walking in and insisting that I needed ""help"" wiping myself up. I had been wiping myself up for years at this point, and she had never needed to ""help"" me before, so it felt wrong. I told her that I didn't need help and asked her to leave, but she insisted. She proceeded to force herself on me and wipe me up. Well, I say ""force"" but really I didn't physically fight back. I only verbally protested. I'd like to note that she used a VERY skimpy amount of toilet paper and I remember that the wiping was slow (I don't know how else to describe it). It was almost like she was drawing it out on purpose (but then again I couldn't read her mind and tell you for sure what her intentions were.) There was always paper between her hand and my genitals, and nothing else but the wiping that I described happened. Also, the wiping incident only happened once because afterwards I refused to go to the bathroom ever again at the therapy place.

440,endeering,1613935560,"hi everyone. i hope you are all doing well and being kind to yourselves. i recently learned that i most likely have adhd, and in beginning to unpack internalized ableism, i realized how judgmental i have been towards myself re cptsd. i've been reflecting a lot and feeling particularly emotional as of late. i wanted to share some love through a thought i had recently with y'all in these trying and politically scary times. 

tw: mention of death

sometimes i feel bad about how i'm not where i thought i would be in terms of my practice (i study fine arts and philosophy), especially when i see how skillful/knowledgeable some people from my cohort are, when they have solo exhibitions or get publications and do conferences and whatnot. it feels like i let a part of my younger self down and i start punishing myself for not being as productive as them, as skillful or as ""intelligent"" (my memory is so fucked that i can't remember much, so i often feel inadequate when i forget what philosophical concepts we learned about refer to) as they are. 

not sure if this is the case with yall, but in being so dissociated from my traumas i often forget what i have been through. my family members were my abusers, and i lived with them until last year. and in only getting therapy for cptsd this year, i get emotional thinking i had to go through all that alone from such a young age, and really wonder how it was even possible for me to keep going when life felt unbearable. for someone who thought they would die at 18, 20 because of my circumstances, it's a miracle that i am not only still here at 23, but am in fact thriving and doing things i never thought i could do, like having my own place and cooking for myself. 

so when you compare yourself to other people and hold yourself to normative standards, remember that they don't in fact apply to you. you had to fight for your survival and for where you currently are; that was never a given for you like it was for others. while some were able to pour themselves wholeheartedly in projects and people, you needed to allocate an incommensurable amount of resources and energy in protecting yourself. an incommensurable amount of resources to now unlearn defense mechanisms that no longer serve you today. you toiled to build your foundation when others already had theirs provided for. i'm finally graduating from my bachelors after 5  years, and was admitted to my masters with a scholarship last week. none of this would have been possible if i didn't keep persevering even when i had no idea what i was doing. 

so stand proud. you have always been doing your best with whatever you had, and you continue to do so everyday. and you have your past self to thank for that. not only is it important to practice compassion with your current self, but also with the you who poured everything they had in conjuring a better future for you, despite of not knowing what that looks like.",CPTSD,you are a success story,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lp4h3q/you_are_a_success_story/,1613906760.0

458,is_reddit_useful,1613925719,"Suppose someone punches you and it hurts. The physical sensations of being punched, including the pain, aren't emotions. Instead, emotions seem to be higher level responses relating to sense of self. In other words, your brain processes the context of the punch and that results in emotions.

I'm only now noticing how I experienced bad past events without much obvious emotion. Like when I saw my mother beating up my father, that hurt, but I didn't develop much emotional response. Even when she pulled my hair and it hurt, that didn't cause much obvious emotional response.

Emotions seem to involve some understanding of context. If someone punches you and it makes you angry, probably you're not going to be angry at only their hand, even though their hand is the object which hit you and inflicted pain.

For another more complicated example, if foreseeable bad weather leads to harm, it might make sense to be angry at things people did or failed to do which led to that harm, like failing to prepare. Probably only getting angry at a storm would be immature, relating to how people could change in the future, but you can't simply change the weather by getting angry at it.

In emotional terms it seems I learned that my mother is like the weather. I learned she's not responsible for her actions, and that she has little or no ability to change in most cases. (There are a few examples where she has a lot of ability to change however.)

468,quitshesays,1613916468,"I often don’t think to bring this up in therapy, but it’s bothering me today and I need to get it out somewhere. 

My mom has bipolar disorder and DID (although she’s been diagnosed schizophrenic and a thousand other things). She had full custody when I was 0-5ish. She was completely unhinged, not in therapy, not taking her medications. 

She had this friend, a gentleman a bit older than her, we’ll call him M. Trips to M’s house were always exciting to me because he had a TV with a big screen and he had all kinds of food for us there. 

There was a canal in M’s backyard and there were always ducks. One day, my mom stole a whole group of ducklings from a momma duck and put them in a laundry basket with a towel at the bottom. I was delighted to have pet ducklings, not understanding she had just stolen wild animals from their mother. 

She put the ducklings in the trunk and closed it. We went shopping. I didn’t know. I hope my mom was just being clueless and not sadistic. This was in Florida. We came back and opened the trunk and all the ducklings were dead, utterly melted, from the heat. It was horrible. 

So many animals died during those years. I have to wonder how she managed to keep two kids alive when she couldn’t keep the pets alive. I have very little recollection of my childhood, but this shit fucks with me.

According to my brother, my mom used to lock us in our rooms for days without access to food, water or the bathroom. I don’t remember this but I remember the ducks, you know? I remember all the animal deaths. I don’t think I even cried, you just get desensitized to it. I used to think it was funny growing up when people would be sad because their pet died. I hate it.

470,holakittyy,1613915955,"Someone mentioned this to me after I showed them my current situation / story (read below). Would like to know if truly you can get PTSD from a relationship....?


Story:
I am (26F) in a 4 year relationship. On February 15th, we had broken up because of inconsistencies from his part (25M): not helping my in the apartment, not ever taking the initiative to take me out for dinner date, prioritized work and because my partner and I haven’t had sex in about 4-5 months and while I find this concerning he doesn’t.

We talked this out, he said that I didn’t care about the fact that in December he told me he was experiencing depression and that even he wants to get better but doesn’t know how to. He cried, so did I, etc. This week he was off, so yesterday we went to the Mall (but he was cranky, so we spent about 20 minutes there) but today surprisingly in the morning he actually invited me to go out for dinner tonight, and he was in a good mood (this hadn’t happened in months). However, after our breakup on Monday today I realized he had taken all of our pics off his social media’s (he said that it’s because basically I was moving out and it was over so in that time he took them out), that unsettled me but I got over it. At dinner today, we touched the point of marriage (yeah, possibly not the right time) but I just wanted to know what he thought. He said “he didn’t know, he hadn’t thought of marriage and it wasn’t in his plans anytime yet”. He is planning to go to his friends on Wednesday which is GOOD because this is something he used to do, that he liked, that he hadn’t done in years. Another positive step he’s making.

He doesn’t want to go to couples counseling, a therapist or see a doctor about his depression. And my question is:  

1) Am I making a mistake by basically making it so my happiness depends on his mood / this relationship? Should I focus more on myself, and wait out to see if he keeps improving?
I also look at my friends social media, and sometimes it makes me jealous that their significant others seem to treat them better than mine does. I overthink about the way he used to treat me / be vs now. When I first met him, I was his whole world

Or...

2) Am I being gaslighted? Is this all emotional manipulation? And it’s completely uncommon for a man to act the way he’s acting? I don’t know anyone who is living with their significant other. So, honestly I don’t know how common our problems are.


Sometimes I feel that I put too many expectations on him because honestly, I want to be treated special by my partner. I don’t want sex to be an issue, and I don’t want to always be the one to bring up “let’s go out, let’s do this Or let’s do that” also, if things were to improve between us I would see myself marrying him.it was disappointing to hear his answer but again, we’ve had too many problems lately so it’s also wrong timing. I am an overthinker, I overthink the worst of the worst all the time.

I overthink a lot to the point that I experience panic attacks very often. I overthink that he can be lying, cheating, or that he can be manipulating me. He knows when I overthink and when I don’t however- specially now that our lease expires in April, I feel an urge to know if this relationship problem is normal and worth fighting for. I need to know what’s wrong with me mentally,for example after our brief break up he deleted our pictures from his social media. I brought this up and to him this wasn’t a big issue, he said “I’ll figure it out” when I asked him if he was ever gonna post me up there and LITERALLY my mind took me to: “he wants me out of his social media because he’s embarrassed of me, or he’s probably talking to girls, etc” like- my mind drives me crazy.",CPTSD,Am I experiencing CPTSD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/loxlsu/am_i_experiencing_cptsd/,1613887155.0

473,twentysixparade,1613913483,"I have PTSD from being groomed and molested as a teenager. I have C-PTSD from childhood that compounded with the molestation, and set up a patter that almost immediately resulted in an abusive, substance-abuse-based relationship with a boyfriend in high school/early college. That collapsed predictably. I met my ex husband hot on the heels of that.

I thought he was so charming and funny. He was so fun. He made me feel so free. 

But y'all he also got me pregnant when he knew I didn't want to have kids and forced me to have our daughter through pressure applied by our families. I told him I wasn't ready to be a parent and I believed we should give her up for adoption like good Catholics. I was sure I was not going to be a good mother yet. His sister looked at me with the most disgust I have ever seen and told me she would live in a box with her babies, she didn't know what I was talking about when I said we weren't financially or emotionally ready to have a baby. She was 30 and I was 21. They made me feel so fucking stupid. Throughout the pregnancy he would refer to me as his designated driver and get wasted. He got wasted constantly, at least three times a week. I remember being in the hospital after he left me while I was in labor several times to go get fast food to eat in front of me, laying there staring at my beautiful baby girl, thinking about how much I loved her but wishing one of us would die so we wouldn't be stuck in this hell together.

I was (and still am, working on it) a chronic oversharer with a penchant for the dramatic so he knew literally all my trauma. He loved it, loved the idea he was saving me or that I had saved myself maybe? That I was a fallen angel cured by the power of will alone? He would tell people I used to be addicted to opioids and that I had quit as though he were parading my success story as his own victory. 

It feels like I'm going to die. None of my feelings will go back in the container. I don't know what the fuck to do. I can't stretch it out, I can't sit still for more than a few minutes, everyone's still asleep so it's not like I can start banging around cleaning. I want my husband and youngest to know that I can be in control when I'm upset. Every door leads to a room with four more doors, and they're all full of my ex husband and his pain monster's proclivities. 

I guess now that I'm typing this, he never really knew me. I don't know that I've ever looked him in the eye for longer than a minute. We have never, never come to the still and quiet place together, that one where the world drops away and you can see a person and the eye contact doesn't feel uncomfortable. I think maybe I've always just been an object to him, which is why it wasn't a big deal to threaten to blow up my life if I didn't have a baby with him. The next time he knew I was pregnant, when I had left him and the man I had recently slept with had been bailing to the nth degree, I told him I was going to have an abortion and he blew his fucking lid. He called me begging me to keep the baby. He said he would take care of us, we could move into his house, he didn't care whose baby it was, I just needed to keep it or he was going to tell our entire collective devout Catholic family that I had an abortion. I ended up having a miscarriage so the point was null. 

The victim here is my daughter. Make no mistake. I see the ways I enabled him and continued to enable him up until yesterday when I dragged his ass into therapy and told her fucking everything I could think of. We have been divorced for almost five years and he's been treating my with the same sort of object regard for a long time and I've let him by not doing this sooner.

As a child I was abandoned in all senses of the word. I've never learned how to properly express my feelings, as my parents were too busy getting drunk to bother with me. If I ever cried or showed any negative emotions I was physically punished. I was also sexually abused by my father as I hit puberty, which has left me with many issues around sex.

Now, I (24F) am having trouble in my relationship, as whenever my partner tries to talk about our sex life (or lack thereof) I just completely shut down, and I hate it. I so wish I could just say what I feel but my mind goes so blank and the panic sets in that this is it, he's going to leave to leave me because I'm so emotionally redundant.

What doesn't help is that my partner also has PTSD, but his stems from a one-time traumatic occurrence, so I feel that he doesn't understand that our traumas are very different, and mines are so deep rooted that it is going to be a long road to recovery. A few months ago he said to me ""you buried the bad feelings before, can't you just do it again?""

I was literally speechless that he would say this to me, as he really is a wonderful and supportive partner most of the time. He told me today part of him wishes we had just stayed friends, and I know this is because of my communication and emotional expression problems. I feel bad for him because when he met me I was a ball of sunshine soaked in denial about my past. Now, inside a pandemic and lots of time to reflect on what I went through as a kid, I've come to realise that I have a lot to work on to be truly happy in myself. But now I fear I'll be handling it alone, as I have cut myself off from friends to hide the pain I'm in, I live in a different city from my whole family and now the ONE person I thought would fight in the trenches with me is going to leave me for someone a little less ""complicated"".

475,oddynana,1613912890,"I want to start by saying that I have no memories of any kind of assault. 

For years I have ignored my own feelings and experiences, convinced that I just want ""attention"" or to be ""special"", but due to some recent trauma unloading and mental restructuring, I've decided to start listening to myself.

For the past 8 years, starting when I was 14, maybe earlier, I've felt unsafe. Every day, nearly every second has been spent feeling like if I relax for one moment I'll be violated. Some nights I can't sleep until 5AM because I feel like if I let my guard down something will happen. I feel nauseous. (This is the most graphic part, just a heads-up) I feel an extreme discomfort around and aversion to penises. I am haunted by phantom genitalia touching me, entering me. I keep my mouth closed unless I'm talking or eating because otherwise my mind will create an imaginary dick and jam it in there, this still happens when my mouth is closed, it's just easier to deal with. I feel phantom penetrations constantly. It weighs so heavily on me that I can feel it. My mind creates the idea that my stomach is full of semen to the point that I want to vomit. Beyond that, sometimes it feels like phantom hands are trying to pry into my vagina. 

(Graphic description over)

Beyond that, I've never felt comfortable with sex. I'm asexual, so I always thought it was just normal sex aversion, but I'm starting to think it's more than that. Even looking at any kind of genitalia is horrible to me, I can barely look and recoil in disgust, even illustrations. My entire life I've been filled with dread for the day a doctor needs to look at my body in any way. I wouldn't let a doctor perform a breast exam as a teenager because it made me panic. I shared a fraction of this with my boyfriend and he said he'd always suspected ""something"" had happened to me, just from my behavior. I've always been very into social justice, but have long shied away from the mainstream feminist movement as so much of it is steeped in sex, genitalia, the body. 

Due to all of this, I essentially have no peace of mind. It's hard to sleep and I'm never totally relaxed. When I try mindfulness meditation I just feel vulnerable to the attacks, I have no mental safe spaces because they are immediately invaded by sexual attack when I try to make them. I have lost years to feeling like this and I don't want to lose anymore. The biggest question I have is - why? As I said at the beginning, I have no memories of ever having been assaulted. As far as my mental timeline goes, this all just started one day for no real reason. I can't identify any person it could have been or period in my life it could have happened. I know I said 8 years, but the fear has been around longer.

481,Insaneonthemembraine,1613905358,"I’ve had over 20 years of therapy and tbh it’s pretty much made no difference. I suspect it’s held me back as I often leave feeling invalidated .
2 years ago I finally got a diagnosis that made sense. Cptsd and DID NOS I’ve had about 50 sessions with my current psychologist who is definitely the best to date. However this current life melt down has gone on for 3 years and has gradually gotten worse. I had to bluntly point this out to him recently. 
I’ve had several sessions of emdr around some of the worst stuff. I definitely felt way more anxious, angry after each one, particularly after the session around the earliest sexual abuse. During that session I ugly cried like I never have in my life... but we kept going. It was a huge relief to cry like that.  I went swimming immediately afterwards to destress . I had a panic attack in the pool. After another emdr session around domestic violence i found myself trying to sleep with clenched fists for a while. My therapist told me  that this was positive.... and “ just to feel it”. That so sounds like crap to me. 
I was assured that emdr would help the memories fade. The memories have done the opposite. I continue to have flash backs... some new and some old. New memories have emerged and the nightmares are more vivid. I no longer work or see people. I struggle to even get a hair cut because I can’t do small talk. I have minimal control over what comes out of my mouth. 
So I’ve started to take the bull by the horns after reading a fantastic post on here, ( some one posted that they finally realised that no one is coming to save them) 
I’m medicating with psilocybin and reading about trauma. I’ve learned more from my reading a few books than I have from a dozen therapists. I’ve also started listening to loving kindnesses meditations. 
I now understand why the therapy has failed. Why I behave the way I do.  I’ve put way too much trust and faith in my therapists. I forgot——- I have choices now. 
Thanks to psilocybin I have recently begun to listen to my gut. My gut is telling me that I’ve made things way worse in therapy by discussing my childhood.... particularly with the emdr. With my word finding issues when upset I will never be able to fully say what happened. Time to stop trying. 
I’ve asked my therapist to stop me if I begin to talk about the past. Instead our therapy focus is on discussing psychology and what I’m reading. ( currently The Body Keeps The Score)
I always felt like such a failure at therapy. Now I’m beginning to suspect that my well meaning therapists have been plodding along clumsily making things worse by their own limited understanding of cptsd and didnos. 
Has anyone else had a similar experience?

My therapist calls me when he has a cancellation to offer me an appointment.. about every 2 weeks or so.  He keeps asking if this is an ok arrangement. I say yes as the first time he said this he said “ it’s all I have” . Is this as dodgy as I think it is?

I think I might be suffering from CPTSD, but I am not sure if this is a valid trauma, but still I decided that I really have to reach out because I am very concerned. Also, I am afraid to reach out to anyone in my close circles because I don't feel comfortable telling them. I know it is impossible to diagnose people over the internet, but I think your input might give an indication that I am searching in the right direction. This will be a long post, you can find a **tl;dr** down below.

Firstly I will introduce myself. Secondly I will describe my story. Then, I will share the problems I encounter. At the end you will find a conclusion. Anyways thank you for taking the time to read my story.

*Note: English is not my native language, therefore there might be some gammar errors.*

# Introduction

I am a M18 from the Netherlands. I live in a fairly small town near the coast. I live in a 7 person household; Mum and dad, one older sibling (M21), me, two younger brothers (M16, M13) and a younger sister. I go to university and I Invest in stocks and cryptos. Also I like going to the gym. I got a few close friends.

My older brother is very important in this story so I'll give a little background information. My brother is 21 years old and diagnosed with autism. He is very unpredictable and abusive.

This should be enough information to understand the family dynamics for this story.

# My Story

I was born into a family with my parents and one older brother. My older brother couldn't stand my existence for some reason. In my first year alive he already asked mum that I had to leave. Also he smashed my head on the age of 2 onto the plateau the tv was standing on. My head was bleeding heavily.

A year later when I learned to walk and talk, he started bossing me around. I always had to suck up to him, every little thing I was doing was wrong, bad or stupid. In the very common situation that I did something wrong according to him, he shouted, cursed or beat me. As we got older he started to get bullied in school because of his autism. Which made him even more inclined to use me as an outlet. Even though there were a few more brothers available to abuse, he still chose me.

I always needed to follow his actions. Brother bought a Nintendo DS, I bought a Nintendo DS even though I didn't even know what a DS was. Brother bought an iPod, I bought an iPod. Around the age of 10 he wanted me to buy a pair of Beats by dre headphones, so I bought a pair. Half a year later he destroyed the headphones with an enthusiastic jerk while I was listening to music. I said ""WTF IDIOT!"", he was already waiting to boss me around. I couldn't take it anymore, I fought back. He is 2,5 years older, so he is naturally stronger than I am. He fought very hard, kicks, punches, scratches, bites and knives. mum and dad were at work. Grandma was taking care of us but she couldn't get inbetween us. He grabbed a knife, but someone overmastered him. I can't remember who. He ended up beating me so hard I had to go to school the next day with a blue face. Everyone asked me ""what happened?"", but I was too afraid to tell anyone. From that day forward every fight got more intense.

My older brother told me very very often that I was the source of all his problems, therefore he was going to kill me. We started fighting really often because of that, dad had to intervene as he became as strong as a grown man. The fights usually ended up with the police storming the place because he was very lethal with knives. I started getting suicidal, but I was afraid of harming myself. Also I do not want to leave the family in that kind of pain. He really convinced me that HE and him only was going to kill me. So I actually started enjoying the fights knowing he might actually do it and he really tried.

It was not fun at home, so in primary school I went outside a lot with 'friends'. They weren't actually my friends, I just wanted them to accept me. I suggested that I steal some sweets from the super market to make them like me and make me feel wanted. Instead some boy snitched me in front of my dad and I got in big trouble. After having learned that lesson, 11 year old me spent €100 on sweets and snacks for my 'friends'. It's not that I was naive, because I knew damn well that they used me. But it felt better than staying home and being beaten by your brother.

I asked mum about my big brother ""why can't he leave, he is dangerous to all of us."" The only reaction I got was ""Don't you dare talk about him like that, you know that he is autistic and he can't do anything about it."" Never asked my parents to help me with anything again. I had to figure it out on my own, I never showed my emotions ever (except happiness). Since I wasn't planning on taking my own life, I had to become a really successful person as a coping mechanism. I started sporting a lot, reading, working, investing etc. etc. And it started working out for a while. I was sporting almost all day except for the times I had to go to school. It was more like escaping my problems instead of facing them. But it made me happy for a while. Also I got really arrogant, and didn't consider other people as human beings.

When Covid-19 happened and everyone went in lockdown, my brother finally moved out. Thank god. And it is also the time I considered trying to be a more social person, because it was finally safe to. But I realized I had been missing out on so much opportunities. Which made me extremely unhappy. Which resulted in me abusing substances one too many times. I tried taking psychedelics a couple times to see what was wrong with me, I realized I had become an empty shell with no empathic ability, that wants success above all to cope with my problems. It is really hurting me. I have become a really sensitive person, but no one knows. Everyone knows me as an arrogant emotionless mf, if I told what was wrong I would just be labeled as an attention seeker. Especially this lockdown has affected my mental health really badly

After a couple years of grinding my work is finally starting to pay off, but now I encounter even more unbearable problems. Last week for example I made more money in a week than my parents together earn in a month but I couldn't feel happy. My parents know I make a lot of money investing. My mum is not really a supportive person. She criticizes almost everything I do, but when she knew I earn loads of money. She acts as if I am the favorite child, she always asks ""how much money have you made this week"", instead of ""how are you"" or ""are you feeling alright"". I feel like she loves my money more than me, that’s fucking unbearable for an 18 year old kid. Also, I don't feel like I deserve it. I feel so bad knowing that my parents went to university and worked decades just to get an average income, and me just making a few times that amount with little education and work experience prior makes me just unhappy. I don't want to outshine people I love, but I do it too easily.

Last week I smoked a blunt with my best friend and I started overthinking so heavily I just couldn’t talk. I am constantly in my head. He asked me ""don’t you feel guilty for not talking at all."" I wanted to scream on the top of my lungs but nothing came out of me. I went home and I just cried in my room. I felt like I was going crazy. I tried improving last week once again, but yesterday I smoked some weed at my friends and we had to be home before nine. So when I walked home it the weed hit me real hard, it hit me so hard it was unlike any experience ever before. I was almost at home I only had to cross the railroad. But a train was coming and the lights started flashing and beeping. I couldn't stop walking. I felt a energy pulling and calling me to jump in front of the train. I tried walking backwards and holding on to a street lamp. I thought ""It won't happen here right"". The energy started pulling me harder and harder. I was so fucking terrified, ""please don't make this happen to me, I have so much to live for."" My heartbeat raised to 200 BPM in an instant. My life flashed right before my eyes. It was so powerful. Then the train passed by and I was safe. I never ever had such an powerful urge to commit suicide, FUCKING HELL WTF IS WRONG WITH ME. I got my ass home ASAP, and I hopped inside of bed. Today I started scrolling on the subreddit suicidal\_thoughts. Enough is enough, I am making this post. I have been postponing it long enough, I've been thinking weeks about making this post. Please send help. I am afraid that I might lose it one day. They say god gave you this life because you are strong enough to live it, how strong do you expect me to be then?!

# The Issues

In this part I will reveal the issues I have been facing, there will be undoubtably more issues I forget to mention but these are the most common issues.

**The feeling that no one really loves me like I love others**

Everyone seems utterly incapable of loving me like I love other people. I am always the person to love people more than they do it back. It is just the most unbearable tought I have ever had in my life.

**An extreme need for validation and attention**

I know wanting other peoples validation is generally bad, but honestly I crave it a lot. I always dismiss compliments because because I dont feel like I deserve it, therfore it feels like flattery but I still crave it a lot.

**I get overwhelmed by my thoughts**

Every day I think so much about life, existence, people, money, spirituality its just so overwhelming. I always daydream during lectures in University it makes it very hard to concentrate. This world feels like the most cruel place ever. I feel like a stranger to this world. I always lose track mid conversation because my mind has wandered off and I have a hard time coming back into it.

**I feel like a stranger to the world.**

People always seem to have different issues on their mind than I have. I have a hard time understanding people.

**I feel like I don't deserve it.**

As stated above, I am working on myself relentlessly and it is starting to pay off. I still feel like I do not deserve it. Even though I worked hours and hours. When people compliment me, it feels like flattery. I also don't feel like reaching out for help because I do not think I deserve help.

**I don't trust people with my thoughts and feelings**

I don't trust people because I feel that most people if not all people do nor have my best interest at heart. I tried telling the story to some people. Some people ghosted me, some people completely miss the point, some people are using it against me. I feel like an ugly person for trying to open up. People are fucking manipulative.

**I can't maintain healthy boundaries because I am afraid of confrontation**

Confrontation is very scary to me because I always imagine the worst happening as you can read above. My friends sometimes make statements that are just not tolerable, I always laugh and brush it off making me feel dreaded inside.

**I have been getting a lot nightmares since the age of 13 years old**

Since the age of 13 I have been getting really intense nightmares, the only way to escape my nightmares is screaming on the top of my lungs. The only way for me to leave sleep paralysis is screaming. 

**I act either way too distant or way too clingy**

I dont want people to hurt me in any way possible, I refrain from talking to people by putting on a massive resting b\*\*\* face. Some people are trying to get me to open up, but then I keep them on a distance. If I think a person is safe to talk to and is showing me human decency, I tend to get really really clingy and scare them off.

**I fall in love with almost every girl I talk to**

Girls that act like decent human beings are easy for me to fall for. They show a quality I have been looking for all my life. As a result I fall way too fast and way to often. It never works out though. I refrain from going into relationships and hookups.

**People are suspicious**

People are pretty scary beings to me, I generally think that most people are planning to take advantage of me or harm me in any way. I refrain from revealing anything I know, because I am afraid they will find a way to use it against me.

**I do not show emotions at all.**

I don’t feel comfortable showing my emotions to anyone, when you are in an emotional state you are easily to manipulate because you act irrationally. I always lock down my room when I want to cry or scream. 

**Severe Porn Addiction**

I watch way too much porn and its making me feel like a bag of potatoes. It uses your psychology against you to leave you wanting more. It's robbing of my happiness.

**I don't feel safe without a knife around**

My fear of confrontation with people has caused me to always keep a knife with me. I keep them around me as often as I can.

**I am abusing substances to make me feel good, I am really tempted to use cocaine**

I have been using weed, alcohol, ritalin, shrooms, mdma, lean to make me feel normal. The use of cocaine is very appealing to me because I want to be so arrogant that I make other people suck up to me.

**I feel a need to manipulate or dominate people to get my way**

I want to get my way so desperately to the point I am considering manipulating people to get what I want because that is the only way I seem to get what I want.

**The feeling of emptiness and existential questions**

I feel really empty and sad most of the times, life sometimes feels so hopeless. Because of that I get in my head real often and ask my self existential questions.

**The feeling that I don’t want to exist**

I generally do not want to kill myself, I'd rather just disappear. View life from spectator mode.

# TL;DR

Too long; Did not read. Here is the story and here are the issues I have been facing with.

I am a M18 in a household of 7 familiy members. I am the second child, I was born into a family with one other brother with autism. My brother was not happy with my existence he did everything in his power to make suck up to him. I always did things wrong according to him, if I did something wrong he punched, cursed or shouted at me. As we got older he started bossing me around more and more often, at one day I had enough. We started fighting really really often. He tried making me submit by grabbing knives. He said I was the reason his life sucked, therefore he was going to kill me. We started fighting a lot to the point where the police had to storm our house. I got suicidal but afraid to self harm. I started fighting him more and more often to make the possibility of him killing me greater. It never happened, the fights still continued. If I wasn't going to kill myself, I had to become a really successful person as a coping mechanism. It made me a cynical empty shell. This coronalockdown I became more successful than ever before, but also the most unhappy I have ever been. I am not a normal functioning human being anymore. I am suspicious of everyone. But I have been craving human interaction more than ever. Yesterday I smoked a blunt with my friends and on the way back home I had the biggest suicidal urge ever, I really have to make this post asking for help. 

These are the issues I have been facing with:

* The feeling that no one really loves me like I love others
* An extreme need for validation and attention
* I get overwhelmed by my thoughts
* I feel like I don't deserve it.
* I don't trust people with my thoughts and feelings
* I can't maintain healthy boundaries because I am afraid of confrontation
* I have been getting a lot nightmares since the age of 13 years old
* I act either way too distant or way too clingy
* I fall in love with almost every girl I talk to
* People are suspicious
* I do not show emotions at all
* I feel like a stranger to the world
* Severe Porn Addiction
* I don't feel safe without a knife around
* I am abusing substances to make me feel good, I am really tempted to use cocaine
* I feel a need to manipulate or dominate people to get my way
* The feeling of emptiness and existential questions
* The feeling that I don’t want to exist

# Conclusion

Moving onto a conclusion. I feel like this ticks a lot of checkboxes of past unhealed trauma (CPTSD), but I am no expert and I know that diagnosis over the internet is impossible. But it might give insight if I should reach out to a therapist.

486,path_to_wonderland,1613901116,"A recent post got me thinking: 
[DAE feel jealous of children](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/loi5tr/dae_feel_jealous_of_children/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)


(OP mentiones there how her niece is triggering her jealousy. Worth a read and all the comments too!) 
Being triggered by children and also parents, families, isn't something new to me. 


But for me it gets worse. 


**I hate ALL parents and pregnant women too**


Fuck, this sounds so awful. Like seriously, wtf is wrong with me?! 


E.g.: I have these neighbors who just got their first child. The baby has even been born on my freaking birthday — one minute after I was born. I think they are ""good"" parents. And I often help them out, walking their dog, buying groceries, etc. We're good neighbors, they are nice and sweet, such a pretty family. Still ... **I HATE THEM**


They have a ""perfect"" life. Both of them grew up privileged, a safe home, upper middle class, they have good jobs and a caring family with brothers, sisters visiting. And good friends. They have this gorgeous dog. They are newlyweds. Although their baby wasn't planned so soon (corona kid), they always wanted children. It's  *just* so natural to them. It just happened a bit too early. But that's fine. They never even once had to think if getting children might be something bad to do! 


(That's just one example. I won't even start with bad parents and how that triggers me.)


And then... there's me. I am pretty sure I will never have kids, which I think is a wise move. Deep down I just wish I'm infertile, that would give me the perfect excuse. I wouldn't even get a dog, as how irresponsible and egoistic would it be to get a pet?! Someone like me? 
I'm 33 years, female and get asked so often ""do you want to have kids?"", NO! NO! NO! I can't even *choose*, this is what people don't get. I can't just have a *normal* life. 


Here I am, besides people living their ""perfect"" lifes (of course it's not always what it seems), whilst I am intensifying my therapy before going inpatient for 3 freaking months.

488,phantom_0007,1613896270,"I gave a presentation yesterday and it went pretty badly.  I was supposed to introduce my thesis topic but I didn't outline any of the protocols I was going to use (I thought I was supposed to give a general overview) so now I have to write them all in a document and send the doc to the entire lab.  I just feel like I've disappointed my supervisor and I don't feel like working today.  I think I'm dreading going to work tomorrow too, I'm not really sure.  I just had a really bad experience with a toxic working environment a couple years ago so what happened yesterday was really triggering for me, but this lab is very supportive (well, sort of, I haven't been here very long yet but the people here are nice and my sup is one of the most understanding ones in the whole department).   I was tired from crying for an hour or so yesterday but I still went to lab and just sat there working on something else my sup had told me to help with.

I'm confused because normally after setbacks I go into this depression spiral where I start catastrophizing and think nothing will ever go right again in my life.  That happened a little yesterday but not as much as it used to before.  

I should probably take today off and read a book I've been wanting to finish for quite some time (and probably order pizza) but I'll probably feel guilty about not working (even though I already *was* working for the last 6 days of the week and was running around the whole academic building with my mentor, lol) so I don't know what to do :( how do I stop feeling guilty for taking time off and not being ""productive""?  I feel like I know objectively know that it's not healthy for me to spend all my time worrying about this (or scrolling through social media) but I can't really *understand* it, you know what I mean?  It's like I always have something in the back of my mind.

Also I'm not used to people not completely berating me after I've done a bad job.  Like my supervisor didn't tell me I was ""disappointing"" or any of the other things I told her my parents say to me pretty often (not anymore because I don't call them that often, they rarely have anything positive to say, but when I was still living with them full-time they were very nitpicky and emotionally abusive); she just gave me a list of things I could do to improve things later on, and gave me a new deadline.  I guess I'm just worried I won't be able to finish things before next Saturday (that's an absurd thought because I just have to search for things that are already available on the internet).  I should probably stop typing, I'm just repeating myself.  I'm going to go take a shower.

499,LeviathanNypmh,1613887347,"I'm 25 and I know that isn't old, by the slightest but feel like a late bloomer. I don't know how to drive yet, I still live with my parents until I transfer, and I don't have that sense of self that I promised I would have when I'm 25. (Like having tattoos, doing activities, driving, and getting my life started) But since COVID, I have been looking back and everything I wanted is stalled again. I was planning to get a job, get a tattoo, get myself ready to transfer, but lockdown started. I'm doing well in school, about to transfer but I hate how I haven't started to build my life or myself up. I'm turning 26 in April and I feel old, I'm jealous that some of my friends moved, live by themselves, transferred, and even if they haven't they are embracing who and what they are. I feel like I'm old, and I'm getting old and I'm to the point when I turn 30 my life will feel like I'm a late bloomer and I'm running out of time. I do want kids and get married but I'm so busy discovering and become who I am, and I might not want to have any unless it feels right and won't interrupt my need to know myself and heal from my childhood and teenhood. I want to have time just for myself, get my dream science job, become a fashion designer and an alternative model. I feel like I have to do it in a hurry or I'm a failure. 

I get so jealous of other peers who have healthy families that embrace who they are, have freedom away from family, don't feel like they're a burden, and even help with the dream they have. Where for mine they weren't there, criticized me, and don't help me. I know 25 isn't old but it's a far cry from what imagined of where I'll be.

I haven’t been diagnosed, but I do have a lot of symptoms of ptsd, so I hope this is the right sub.
I had this abusive friend (made a post detailing everything she did already) and one thing she did to hurt me was hurt this other girl I was friends with and that she’d abuse too. She drag us to the bathroom then make me watch her beat her up, most of the time until she was unconscious. A lot of the time she’d even continue after that. I keep on remembering this one time, where she grabbed her by the hair and pulled her head up so she’d look at me, then say “Look at her, look at what you made me do to her. Are you even going to apologize?” And stuff. I did after that, a lot. Then she said “you don’t seem sorry enough, guess I’ll fix that” and rammed her head into the floor a few times. I was screaming and she said that if I didn’t stop she’d do it again, so I stopped. I still hear the sounds it made, her head hitting the floor. She found so much pleasure in making us suffer, and sometimes I just wonder why she did it. To an 11 and 10 year old. She’s describe what she did to her previous victims, and always seemed so..proud of it. Even from when she was the age I was at the time. So maybe she just started off that way. I hate still hearing it, seeing it. I’d have to clean it up afterward and try to help her.

The TW on this is for sexual assult, and a shit time opening up about said sexual assult.  but there is other stuff in here that can be triggering, so read with caution or dont read it, i dont want to trigger any of you :)



Right off the bat, i guess we have mt parents divorce, witch happend when i was really young. This itself hadnt really had that much of an affect on me, other then a lot of spilt tears when i was old enough to understand it.

Then we have my mother, who isnt tocic, but has sone tocic traits for sure. She always shoots me down when i talk about anything related to my mental health, hardly spends any time at all with me or my sister, gets angry easy, has left me and my sister in a cold ass car for a few hours while she worked out in a gym, thinks she is always right and never litsens to me, always says she will look into getting me therapy, but its been a year, and she never did, and the worst thing she has done/still does is defend my ex step brother after he had sexually assulted me several times, even going as far as to laugh at me when i first told her about it, and says he was just being a teenage boy. Now whenever i talk to her, i get a wave of dread and anxiety, along with never truly opening up to her.

My ex step brother sexually assulted me several times when i was to young to know to say no, he got off with hardly a slap on the wrist, and i had to live with him for 2 years after that. A spicy bonus is that when i told my friends who i truly thought i could trust, they ALSO laughed at me.

When i was young, my mother and aunts/uncles all got drunk and got into a fight while me, my sister, and our cousin got locked in a room, the cops were called and i remember being terrafied. Obviously, i now have a massive fear of intoxicated people.

I've lived in flats and rooms my entire life and have always been a night owl, i've always been pretty sensible with noise and take care not to disturb my neighbours but something is triggering me to the point I feel I need complete silence and I can't pinpoint why. 

I moved in to my partners house around 6 months ago and since then i've become pretty intolerable to noise, we live in a mid terrace so neighbours either side. I feel like i'm always on edge as if they can hear me which makes me incredibly anxious that something bad is going to happen. I've gone from being fairly chatty to quiet, I can't stand the tv being loud, doors being shut, I need to whisper if I want to talk, I can't walk up the stairs normally- I have to go as slow and quietly as possible. 

Sometimes the noise physically hurts.  It honestly feels as if i'm stuck in some shitty apocalypse movie where if you make a noise you're dead. The thing is I know it's in my head, we hardly ever hear our neighbours despite them having children/pets so the walls are fairly decent - even when we're awake during ""normal hours"" we can't hear them 

I'm aware that this level of concern isn't normal and I don't want my partner to feel like he can't live comfortably on his own house as that's really unfair.

512,666Karmah,1613876858,"I was recently diagnosed with CPTSD, but i'm not sure if this aspect of it is trauma.

I never met my real birth mom, she stopped seeing me when I was 2. Growing up I was raised by my grandparents and didn't really think about it much, somehow. I think I was either repressing it or it just didn't hit me yet. All I heard were things like she's crazy, but they didn't make many comments on her in general.

When I was 18 I got home from school one day and saw a letter on the table in the mail. It was addressed to me and it was from my mom. My grandparent's didn't realize it was from her.

It turns out for my whole life they've been getting letters addressed to me from my mom and throwing them out. I never asked them about my real mom so I guess that right there is my fault but I kind of just figured she didn't give a fuck about me.

I ended up reading the letter and it turns out my mom is schizophrenic or something, she was very delusional. Shortly after reading the letter I developed depersonalization after drug usage in the following months.

I have dreams that my grandparents are hiding other things from me, and I feel like there is so much more wrong with me than what meets the eye because I feel so disgusting and dirty all the time. I have dreams where they're hiding something from me so I guilt trip them by self harming in front of them (I have never self harmed before.)

I'm not asking if what they were doing is morally right or not, because I was somewhat ""normal"" until I read the first letter from her and then convinced myself i'll get schizophrenia. My grandparents said they feared i'd start to see myself as a product of my unhealthy parents when I have been doing good all this time.

But the work is starting to pay off and show off. I can cry again. I've cried a lot of times in the past couple of weeks. As someone with a very strong freeze response and dissociation. This is great progress because I was not very attuned with my emotions when I started. As I had to dissociate as one of the survival mechanism's in my abusive mother's house. Also my trauma responses are starting to shift into healthier ones. It is rare for me to fawn to people nowadays. A year ago I struggled so much with setting boundaries and saying no. But now I don't have any problem doing so. But that took a lot of practice and I went through a lot of shitty learning and life experiences to reach this phase. 

I'm also realising my fight response and it's strong role in my life. I thought I was mainly a fawn/freeze type. But now thinking about it I am more of a fawn/fight/freeze type. With fawn and fight being the dominating f types I would say. I used to have VERY codependent friendships which were the literal reenactments of the Karpman Codependency Triangle. Where there were the persecutor/rescuer/victim roles. Recently I've processed that my own codependency was mostly a fawn/fight response for me. It was this cycle where I would be a rescuer, light myself on fire to keep the other person warm. I wouldn't set boundaries or anything but then I'd grow resentful and seek to punish them utilising passive aggressive methods. Thats where my fight response came in. I'd start being in coercive control and push them to do things etc etc. I'd be impulsive and jump to conclusions instead of thinking things through. I'd say harmful and mean things.

I was never close to her as we're not related by blood and I never knew her before she had Alzheimer's, so in a sense she never knew me either. I really have no good memories of her because during one of her episodes when I was in middle school she became violent and physically attacked me. My parents never took the incident seriously since they had left my younger brother and I alone to babysit her and didn't believe ""an old lady with no memory could ever hurt anyone"". 

Now my parents are trying to use her death as a way to ""get closer"" and ""fix our family issues"". They've offered to pay for counseling and other fees and are saying that now that my grandmother is gone, they finally ""have the time to focus on me"". I'm 24. I moved out when I was 18. They never cared to form a relationship with me and never cared to be around when I was growing up because they had ""other people to take care of"" and my brother and I just got in the way. 

They also want me to take my cat so they can sell my grandma's house faster because my cat is ""taking up space and doesn't get along with their other cats"". I unwillingly left my cat with them after I moved to college because I couldn't have animals in the dorms and haven't been financially stable enough to take care of a pet since then. I'm still not financially stable to have an animal, but they have offered to pay for her food and any emergency vet bills that come up as long as I take her. 

I really would like my kitty back as she is my ESA  (as approved by my doctors due to my PTSD) and really helped me with my mental health, but this puts a huge wrench in my plans to cut all contact with my abusive mother and her girlfriend. My plan was to get a full time job and get financially stable enough where I could pay for my cat's needs, get my own phone bill and then switch carriers/numbers so they'd never be able to contact me again. But then COVID hit and I've been in and out of jobs. My state's unemployment department also lost a class action lawsuit and I haven't been paid unemployment since last August. There are 9,000 cases ahead of mine, so I wont be getting unemployment anytime soon. It's been especially difficult because my partner has an autoimmune disease and I have disabilities so I can't just take up any job as much as I'd like to.

I reached the conclusion long ago with my counselors that there's no fixing my family situation and my parents have shown time and time again they feel no need to change and have continually downplayed the severity and neglect they put my sibling and I through. I do not feel family counseling will be of any help at this point. 

But I do desperately want my kitty back. I know she's going to be continually neglected by my parents (she's morbidly obese and my parents refuse to put her on a diet or give her proper food and exercise/play with her). It's breaking my heart thinking about leaving her with them, but I don't want more strings attaching myself to my abusers when what I truly want is to never have to speak to them again. Right now it's just the phone bill attaching me to them but once I get steady income I can get my own phone plan.

I went through a lot of extended abuse. I think I was scared since I was born almost. The abuse sadly continued for a long time into my adulthood. 

I have been in therapy and also to some body workers. A few times things like adrenaline addiction or adrenaline poisoning me on regular bases were mentioned. I have noticed that there were times in my life where I felt more relaxed and then most of my life I feel different than that. Various types of tense. A lot of emotional flashbacks. Sometimes I wonder if I am in a steady state of emotional flashback. I thought perhaps the tension and anger bursts and similar things could have to do with adrenals and if I could do something about it, perhaps it would just make my body feel better.

I looked around for what is said on the topic a bit, but it is all a bit wishy washy and sometimes even contradictory. And it seems to be something that people interested in weight loss look into, which is not my issue. So I came here to see if anyone tried to approach their problems from this angle. With food, perhaps some supplements, exercise. Something that worked for you. Or some resources on the topic that you find reliable.

I asked this in another sub that had people who practice it and don’t, mentioned trauma but didn’t really go into it, and it wasn’t asked to only people who’ve experienced childhood sexual trauma; so I’m here.




After my “second” sexually traumatic event I went wild just drinking and sleeping around. I didn’t care at all who I slept with or how or anything. I’m quite lucky I survived my teens without disease; though I did get pregnant at 19. That tamed me to a degree. I do think about whomever I’m with before I’m with them now and for many years since. 





I met someone through a dating app. I’ve talked with him for a while now with some gaps, my doing. I’ve met him in-person a few times now, but it’s been quick and we haven’t done much or had the opportunity. He’s brought up something I wasn’t quite prepared for. Though we met through a dating app, I’ve made it clear from the beginning I didn’t want a relationship and the other “things” in my life that don’t always make it easy to meet up. So this was never an interest in long-term commitment. He knows nothing about my trauma history so this isn’t someone preying on a vulnerable person using that to his advantage. 






He’s expressed an interest in choking during sex. I feel like I can trust him *because* he asked and didn’t just do it. I’m afraid though. I’ve been choked, not in a sexual context, and it was scary, but that was terrifying because I didn’t know if it would stop and was afraid for my life. Even hypersexual, I’ve never *intentionally* acted out abuse or even had an interest in it for fear it would cause more trauma and worse PTSD. Has anyone actively “practiced” choking in BDSM with a safe word/gesture and been okay or better after? Or any other risky BDSM acts that were okay and didn’t retraumatize you? Did directly acting out help you in any way? Anyone more traumatized by reenacting their abuse? It’s my understanding that the sub is the one ultimately in control so with that it feels a little less sinister. 





I have allowed some acts of abuse intentionally, and I can’t say it helped but it didn’t make anything worse either. I did enjoy making the man I was with then happy since he was interested in that, but it did nothing for me emotionally.

520,floopy_egg,1613871294,"Hi all, I am not looking for a diagnosis here but rather am wondering if this is a possibility or if anyone else has experienced something similar. I have tried searching for answers elsewhere and have found nothing.

I am suffering from OCD but ERP and CBT just do not work no matter how hard I try. After doing quite a bit of self reflection and taking a break from therapy, I stumbled upon this subreddit and was surprised to realize how much of the feelings here I can relate to. Extreme sense of shame, feeling like I don't deserve things, maladaptively perfectionistic, craving affection, feeling like I'm always doing everything wrong, etc. In particular, the way that many people on this subreddit do not like CBT as treatment for CPTSD because it feels like they are being blamed for everything and are on their own to fix their problems themself. 

Here is the issue, though: I haven't had any traumatic experiences that I can remember. However, the only childhood memories that I have are of me feeling ashamed, embarrassed, or judged. This is tricky though, because I don't know if I was being actively shamed or if that is just how I perceived it, because I've been highly self-critical for as long as I can remember.

I do wonder, however, whether the way the people close to me reacted towards my anxiety as a kid may have contributed to these negative feelings. For instance, since I was very little, I constantly had worries in the form of ""what if"" questions. To me, my what ifs were totally possible, but my mother would get annoyed and tell me to stop asking ridiculous what if questions. I didn't get why she thought they were ridiculous, and so I just kept worrying, and I didn't seek reassurance anymore because I knew that I'd make people annoyed. These what ifs never went away, and I kind of wonder if my OCD compulsions may have developed partially as a way for me to reassure myself when I was younger. (I was not diagnosed until I sought help myself in university.) I was basically just always worried or scared, but no one ever really took me seriously, or they would just get annoyed that I was scared because I was making things more complicated for them.

I also had a couple of tics from the ages of 8-11, although I didn't know the word for it until a few years later. They were quite noticeable, mainly hard blinking and clearing my throat. My mother would get annoyed with me for this too, and would tell me to stop, which I couldn't, obviously. When I did it in public, she'd always tell people that it was just a weird habit, and I was too self-conscious to try to explain to other people that I couldn't help it. I realize that a lot of kids in that age range have tics, but they are sometimes associated with anxiety, and as I've mentioned, I was extremely anxious as a child. My mother drawing attention to it definitely didn't help, either.

So all of this to ask, is it possible that I developed CPTSD (or symptoms resembling it) due to people constantly dismissing my anxiety and getting annoyed with me over it?

522,munkyie,1613871132,"Hi there.

I’m a CSA survivor, it’s impossible for the people who abused me to be brought to justice due to my own erasure of the evidence and the length of time that has passed/the fact that they live in another country/other issues that have guaranteed that there will be nothing that comes of it.


I feel a lot of anger, all the time. I can’t stop thinking about what I could have been, I can’t stop thinking how their actions have severely impaired me to the point that my brain works differently now. 


Because of this anger, I feel an extreme need to “get justice”, in any situation I feel is unfair or biased or anything like that. This includes me getting into constant arguments online with people because I just feel plain angry; I want to get one up on people I think are behaving unfairly. I also am angry and armed with knowledge about causes I feel are against injustice, for example feminism; this causes arguments very frequently also. Sometimes I just want to yell at someone and be totally, completely right and just in my anger. 



Obviously this takes up a lot of mental energy, I don’t feel like it’s a very healthy way to deal with this anger. I really want to find a way to deal with it better while still releasing that sense of frustration. I’ve tried punching a pillow; and I live with family that doesn’t really understand/know these things. 


Do you have any advice that could help me get this frustration out healthily?

Ever so often, I catch myself getting triggered by my 9 year old niece, a lovely little girl. As petty as that sounds, I think I know why. 

My niece is an only child and is loved and pampered to bits, sometimes to an unreasonable degree. She has this unshakeable sense of protection, of being loved and treasured. Every time she is not the center of attention, her parents makes sure she is. They cajole her and shower her with attention. She is never allowed the opportunity to feel like she's second-place, ever. Never had to experience shame or fear for being who she is.

I catch myself feeling uncomfortable when this happens. And as a woman in her mid-thirties, it's followed my toxic, internal shame. 'Get a grip woman! You're not a child! What's wrong with you?'

But I know why. It reminds me of my days as an emotionally neglected child when I had no one to protect me. To prioritize me. To make me feel secure. To make me feel loved. I grew up with a skewed view on love and life. And when I look at her, all I feel is envy. I am filled with grief for a childhood I never had. The hard lessons I was forced to learn as a young kid that the world doesn't revolve around me. That I never had the luxury to grow up feeling safe or to feel enough. Hell, to actually dare to feel like I was entitled to love or happiness. I am jealous. I am jealous and angry. 

And in moments like these, I try to speak to the child within me, to remind her that she is safe. But the journey has been long, hard and exhausting. Sometimes it feels undoable and I don't know whether she(the child within me) will ever feel whole. But I guess I owe it to her to give it my best shot

I am simply exhausted of everything, and that includes describing the horrific (at least to me) things my mom has subjected me to and the unfathomable pain she has caused. i have emotionally isolated myself and stopped trying to make people understand the scope of torment and dysfunction i have to go through. literally as I am typing this I feel I am massively overreacting for attention and to deflect away from my own irreparable flaws. People go through infinitely worse, its not like she trafficks me, I'm just experiencing a totally normal family dynamic but I'm too spoiled and weak and selfish to deal with it. I cannot even physically call what is happening 'abuse' because I feel so dramatic and self-pitying and voracious for attention. I'm sure my mom's (+dad and brothers) incessant belittling and gaslighting LITERALLY ALL MY LIFE about how everything is my fault and they are an angelic, healthy family without their 'fucking parasite of a daughter' contributed to this mindset. also some extremely disheartening confrontations with CPS which included a social worker calling me a selfish waste of resources to my face. (my mom still gleefully loves to remind me of that one)

i used to get super frustrated with them but now i think it's just my fault. it's either that I cannot find the proper words that will evoke the reaction of pure repulsion that would manifest into the empathy i so desperately need, or that I truly am just not going through anything that bad at all.

One thing I have had my whole life is a strong fear/disgust response towards typical cis female genitalia. I can look at it if I have to, but it nukes my arousal and triggers me into a panic attack or flashback spiral. It gets worse the longer I'm around it or if it's in a sexual context.

Problem is, I'm bisexual (yeah that one was difficult to figure out) and my longterm SO is AFAB.

But when those little ""down"" or ""low self-esteem"" moods come out, people always tell me I ""shouldn't"" feel that way about myself.

I'm sorry that it's exhausting to love myself every day when nobody else does. I'm sorry I had to build my own self-esteem from birth to adulthood because my family would bully me or flat-out mentally abuse me over everything I did. I'm an artist and they always made fun of my art, and told me I wasn't as good as I thought I was. They bullied me about everything, and a lot of other things in my childhood contributed to my low self-esteem, but this was the one thing that I remember a lot, because I wanted to be an artist and art was (and is) my life. The fact that I stuck with it, the fact that I don't hate myself or my art 100% of the time, I think is impressive. If one day I say ""I don't like my art"", that's better than me giving up or saying it every day.

I wonder what it's like for people who just received love as a child? Who had parents or siblings or friends who genuinely cared for them and liked them? How does it feel to not fully carry the burden of loving yourself because nobody in your life would do it? What's it feel like to not have to do that as a child? To not have to do this for 25+ years? I will never know. I was my own parent, I was my own friend. I'm proud of myself for growing my own self-esteem from nothing- even less than nothing, because I was being punched down constantly and I had to struggle to even stay on a baseline ""I don't hate myself"" level.

I'm kinder to myself. I think of the child version of myself. She- or any child- should never have to feel like they are solely responsible for providing love for themself. It's not fair to be expected to do this and expect yourself to turn out ""fine"", to expect loving yourself to come as easy as it ""should"".

It's something I'm working on, obviously. I want to love myself more. I love myself more every day. But I hate being criticized for having those occasional ""I don't like myself as much today"" days.

When I watch people in love on television it makes my heart ache, I feel like I have no purpose on this Earth other than to serve others and I feel totally empty. Its hard to be content whilst single when the reason I am single is because of all the hurt and pain I’ve endured. I feel like no one who is genuine and kind will ever want me, and all I’m good for is to be used and abused :( I just want a companion who I can curl up with at the end of the day.

However, for the past 4 days since signing the offer back I’ve been shut down and pretty much just crying in bed. I do what I have to to survive like eating and not much more. I don’t know why. 

I was crying this afternoon and it was a memory of crying for my Dad when I was little, maybe 4-5. He loved me when I was little, I remember going fishing and stuff. I remember him being kind and I remember feeling loved. I don’t remember a lot but I remember good feelings.

Then my Mom got angry and my Dad thought we’d be better off without him because then there wouldn’t be yelling at home anymore. I remember my mom threw a cast iron pan at him across the kitchen once. She would go on yelling horrible things for hours. 

He stayed in hotels then eventually got another place, a little apartment. Every time he came to visit there would be yelling and fighting. He didn’t have a vehicle to take all 4 of us anywhere, he always just wanted to come visit. He did stuff outside with us a lot, walks and playing games. He came less and less. I remember being sad and disappointed. I missed him. I couldn’t say it though, I’d get yelled at. After he left he became an alcoholic. He stopped coming. I didn’t see him for years.

The yelling didn’t stop. It got worse. We got yelled at instead. 

I left at 15.

Years later, tomorrow is me and my husband’s baby reveal party and I asked my sister to invite my dad. Apparently he’s excited to come. I don’t care if my mom throws a temper tantrum. She can just leave. I want people there who made me feel loved in my life. She took my dad away when I was little but she doesn’t get a say anymore.

548,MeanwhileOnPluto,1613851882,"Hear me out. I know everyone has their own approach to this kind of thing, but as a freeze type who has a lot of trouble feeling physically connected to the spaces I happen to occupy, I've recently figured out that I've actually been doing quite a bit of emotional processing when I play certain types of video games.

Stardew Valley is mainly what I've been playing these last few months, but in the past I've played plenty of other similar games. I started out on Harvest Moon and the Sims as a kid and I've kind of always been stuck on the genre since then. Now that I'm in recovery, I realize that the draw for me has always been the ability to unrestrictedly create a safe space when I felt unsafe so very often.

Maladaptive daydreaming has always been one of my coping mechanisms, so I keep a close eye on how I'm interacting with any given game and whether or not I'm maintaining a healthy relationship with the time I spend on it. Now that I'm actually aware of what I'm feeling in general, it's gotten easier to have a healthy relationship with these types of games, and I've begun to realize how much they've done for me in terms of whether or not I feel ""allowed"" to make the space around me into something that works better for me personally. I come from a background of emotional abuse and my ""selfishness"" was much maligned in my household, so life sim games gave me a way to start creating safe spaces for myself without my inner critic attacking me.

I'll use Stardew Valley as an example. I've noticed I'm allowed (both in-game and in my real, physical space) to:

\- move something if it's in my way without feeling bad about it

\- make my space prettier to me even if other people think my personal aesthetic is wierd or tasteless

\- change something if it's not working for me, even if i spent time making it look the way it did

\- be stressed out about clutter and know that I need to clean but that the clutter doesn't make me a bad person

\- do small things to mark space as ""mine"" (boundaries were forbidden when I was growing up)

And much more!

It's helped me be kinder to myself and, what's more, it's helped me figure out a little bit about what I like and don't like. I'm realizing I'm allowed to think things are inconvenient because they're in my way, and to make it so that they're not in my way. I honestly feel a little silly posting this, but it really has done... something for me. And I know games like this don't work for everyone-- I've had a lot of issues with video game addiction in the past and I've had to effectively ""ban"" myself from playing certain titles. I'm just pleased that I'm still able to interact with some of them still and get something positive out of it.",CPTSD,Using Stardew Valley and other life sim type videogames as a safe space to process the ways I'm comfortable interacting with the world around me,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lofk06/using_stardew_valley_and_other_life_sim_type/,1613823082.0
549,Sea_Depth9218,1613851840,"A big part of my CPTSD is accepting treatment from others that I would never accept from myself. I set low standards for others because I expect others to act poorly, and I expect them to treat me poorly, and somehow always think this is ""my fault"" in the relationship. It's ""my fault"" for not being ""good enough"" or for not being the kind of person who others want to have around. 

One of the things I'm doing now in 2021 is (gently) cutting off all relationships that aren't working for me. If I text someone or call them and they never call me back except on their own sweet time (three weeks later) with some half-assed apology about how they've been so ""busy,"" that's not OK with me anymore. When I care about someone, I respond to them in a timely manner, and now I'm at a point where I expect them to do the same.

 I understand that we are in tough times and dealing with our own issues. Almost everyone I know has some form of depression or anxiety right now. But, if someone does not have the space in their life to either:

A) make the first contact, EVER, so I am always initiating it 100% of the time

OR EVEN

B) at least respond to me within a reasonable timeframe

then no, I do not hate this person or hold anything against them, though clearly my feelings are somewhat hurt that the relationship is not as mutual as I would like. But I'm ready to see clearly they do not have space for me in their life, and so I no longer have space for them. 

I think a big part of healing with CPTSD is asking for the right kind of treatment from others, and believing that we deserve good treatment. It's easy to make excuses for people. We all have stuff going on. I have been dealing with a LOT these past few years. A lot. Grief, health problems, a legit disability, under-employment, you name it. Yet I always make room in my life for the people who matter. Relationships are important to me, and when people matter to me, I show them that.

Did I remember this falsely because I was high? Or is it because being high made my body comfortable enough to remember?

I remembered his room so vividly which scared me because when I did a virtual tour of the house we were living in, his was the only one where the detail was extremely accurate.

I could write an essay but I'll try to keep it short because I just need to talk to someone. And hopefully hear from someone.

My partner has been in therapy for about a year, for issues involving CSA, parental neglect, etc. I am several years into recovery from CPTSD from child abuse and other kinds of entrapment. Not in talk therapy right now, but EMDR has helped a lot. I am doing better than just a year ago, much more functional and optimistic. 

But, we haven't had sex in years--could count on one hand, and we have been in a long, supportive relationship. But I have had to train my brain to stop thinking of him that way and not expect anything. It has been a source of great pain in my life that I have had to learn to live with. And wince silently at jokes and learn to dissociate when a sex scene came on in a movie. At least it became somewhat more bearable after he told me (many years into relationship) that I was not the only one with whom he had had this problem. In the absence of any other evidence for years (and before he acknowledged lasting harm from CSA to me) I simply assumed I was the problem, and that was not fun. We have been building a more open and honest relationship recently which is good. 

He just told me last night out of the blue that his ""homework"" for therapy this weekend is an ""intimacy exercise"" with me (no sexual contact involved), that requires us to laugh afterward. 

I feel blindsided and angry. I am not the one who is afraid of intimacy in a monogamous relationship. Does his therapist know about CPTSD? I can't be forced to convey an emotion and not feel triggered. What if I feel like crying at the end of the exercise? Why do I have to do homework all of a sudden when I *have done years of work on myself* to live with this relationship, because I did not want to hurt someone who had already been hurt so badly as a child? 

I feel like if I am not the source of the problem, then I shouldn't have to go through this homework. And what the hell therapist who is not a couples' counselor assigns homework to the partner who is not their patient? 

I would appreciate hearing from anyone, even if you have no direct experience with any of this. I have no one to talk to, and feel trapped.

I'm in therapy and feeling I'm too far gone. I hate the thought of being emotional around them. I dont know where to start with EMDR or if it will even work.

I feel overwhelmed by the book Getting Past Your Past. It asks you to think of a place that only has positive memories. I couldn't think of any. Theres things I've enjoyed and I have positive memories kind of but everything is laced with the dread, anxiety and all sorts.

I'm writing this hoping that it validates someone out there, or that someone who is a friends with someone who struggles with trauma and c/ptsd reads it and gets further understanding about this topic. 

This text will touch on childhood trauma, abuse and mental illness. I will not go into detail. 

[Article about Validation and Invalidation. ](https://khironclinics.com/blog/invalidation/)

I'm a 20 year old woman, for the past 6 years I've been trying to heal from more than twelve years worth of childhood trauma. I struggle daily with various different mental illnesses. 

I grew up being constantly invalidated by my caregivers, teachers, counselors, psychiatrists, social workers, even now people around me often invalidate me without meaning to do so. Because of this I still struggle to validate myself and my struggles. 

For the past 6 years I've been trying to heal and recover, but there has been some bumps in the road. At times I've been a very toxic person, I don't say this in order to degrade myself, I'm saying it because it is true and it is something alot of us have gone through/will go through when we recover from our traumas. It's important to remember that this doesn't make us bad people, it makes us human. 

Anyways, over the years I've gotten to hear stuff like this:

- ""Others have it alot worse.""

- ""It made you stronger though.""

- ""Just get over it, it doesn't help to dwell on the past."" 

- ""Everything happenes for a reason.""

etc. 

I don't think that people understand how much this invalidates a person who's struggling with any form of trauma.

Yes, there are people out there who've been through worse things I have, but what happened to me was the worst thing I've personally had to go through. 

Yes, it made me stronger, but I was a child, I didn't need strong I needed safe. And we also have to recognize the fact that not all people become stronger because of their trauma, and those people are also valid. 

PTSD is more than just a mental illness, it's more than just sadness. PTSD is a mental scar and it completely alters how a brain functions. So no, I can't just ""snap out of it"" and ""get over it"". 

Most of the time  Im not the one who dwells on the past, the past dwells on me. 

And last but not least ""everything happens for a reason"", excuse me what? I was a child! There are no reasons as to why a child should be abused and neglected. Saying this completely dismisses a person's trauma and it does not help. 

I don't know what more to write or how to end this little rant but I want to remind you that you're valid. No matter what your trauma is about, you are valid, you are loved and you are important! 

I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm Swedish. And I'm sorry if my text is all over the place, I think way faster than I write haha.

My trauma just makes my life boring. I often don't want to leave my bed in the morning. I'm very emotionally distant from everyone. I have a couple of friends but I rarely see them (Covid really isolated me tbh) and I really have a hard time making new friends because I'm cold and I don't trust strangers.

We were able to go outside though, I don't know how much he controlled what mother did but I know sometimes he even got randomly pissed and left us alone at street so, we could go outside of the house just absolutely not back home... Since it was in another country and such.  

He menaced us with various things like weapons etc.
He would say things like no one is to be trusted, that he could and would keep us in a room forever if we kept wanting to leave him, that we can't leave him etc.
If mother tried to ask for help or explain anyone the situation he would get really angry and violent.
This lasted for a long time but we ended up going back home all together. I don't know if it lasted around a year.

TW: CSA, emotional abuse, physical abuse

I think I'm probably overreacting about things but I wanted a second opinion.

So, I have a friend that was emotional and physically abused and I was sexually abused but not the other two. Something that happens a lot is that when they're feeling invalidated about how people don't take their trauma seriously (and I completely agree that emotional and physical abuse isn't taken as seriously as it should be) they start venting about how people who were sexually abused are taken so much more seriously and get a lot more support. 

I get that they're frustrated and it's hard but it's starting to get really hurtful. At least in my experience, sexual abuse is taken seriously in that if you bring it up people immediately talk about how you made the conversation too dark or too depressing and seriously in that people believe sometimes only that monsters would be sexually abusive so they'll never believe their friends or people they like could be rapists/abusers. But in terms of actual meaningful support, it's very rare. I still have to deal with people messaging me whenever I post about my abuse telling me how they got off to it and how hot it was, doctors who mock me for it, and a lot of other things. And it feels like not only do I have to deal with these things and the lack of support, I have to be apologetic for getting any support that I do.

I've tried to bring it up before but I just kind of get knocked back down and told that people need the chance to vent. But it hurts.

I am an ENFJ who loves to be around others. Some of my best moments in my life are when I seek new experiences and meet new people!

but... 

I feel more introverted with time because sifting through people who are traumaphobic, not open minded or lack understanding, is exhausting, hurtful and ultimately traumatic. 

I feel like I have to go back to the stove that burns me in order to feel socially fulfilled if that makes sense. 

I feel like I’ve found many people who are amazing and they’re like “gold nuggets” but they’re the needle in the haystack. Usually other trauma survivors. 

I asked my friend the other day who was reflecting this herself, “If there was a room filled with similar people like your friends Annie, Elizabeth and John, would you stay up the whole night talking/would it be fun?” And her answer was yes.

I know memories don’t really work like that, that it won’t be a “flood” and I won’t see it all at once. My issue is that because I don’t remember it, it all felt like the first time. I’m not consciously avoiding sleep, I just can’t do it. 

I learned from my therapist that I’ve actually been dissociated for most of my life, so on that night and every day since I’ve been having trouble grounding myself. We’d been working on it for a few months prior to this, but since that night I can’t seem to bring myself back.

I don't know exactly why I'm posting this, I guess I just need to know that someone out there understands how terrible this all feels.

My mother was cruel and abusive to us, and my dad was ignorant and neglectful. Neither of them were mature enough to parent a single child, let alone the three they had. I sort of bore the brunt of it- they were abusive to my already traumatized older brother, who developed into essentially a sociopath who molested, beat, and tortured me the entirety of my childhood. I became troubled and rebellious, and my parents rejected me for that. They complained to my sister about me incessantly, to the point where she became so afraid of being abandoned herself that she developed all sorts of psychological issues. All of that coupled with the horrible fights, verbal abuse, and constant tension in the house left all of us really messed up.

I recently went through a year of intense trauma therapy, and I'm in a better place than I ever have been before. During that journey, I became aware of the way that my parents were continuing to manipulate both my sister and I. I gave them a chance to redeem themselves, but when they tried to get me to discredit my sister's claims of abuse I was finally done with them. I wrote a three page letter that outlined in VERY clear terms exactly what they did wrong. At the end, I told them they had better treat my sister well, because for now she is their only daughter. I said that I would be watching, and that I am no longer afraid to expose them for what they are to the world if I need to.

My sister is in a very bad place both physically and mentally, and she relies on them to pay her medical bills. I've been doing my best to support and help her through her struggles, and that letter was my most impactful way of ensuring that she at least would not be a pawn in my parents' games anymore and would hopefully get all the financial support she needs. But after all that, after sacrificing my sense of family for her safety (of which she does not know and I don't intend to tell her), she is refusing the treatment she needs. She is suicidal, and is in mortal danger every day due to her eating disorder. But she refuses to go to the hospital or consider residential treatment. I just don't have words for how much it hurts to have done so much to try to make it possible for her to heal, then watch her completely reject it all. I'm scared for her life every day but I just can't think of anything else I can do for her. I know I'm supposed to just ""be there"" and ""listen to her"", but how do you just listen to someone you love talking about killing herself but refusing to get help??

 In their minds, they were great parents who did nothing wrong. I was just a bad child. I once made rhe mistake of telling my dad I was reading a book about trauma after childhood abuse -- thinking he at least accepted what my mother did and just wanted us to move forward from it which is why he was so dismissive -- and he just said ""none of that ever happened to you."" 

I think I have this fantasy, this hope, that one day, they'll own up, take responsibility, they'll see it and see me and apologise. Even as a child this would happen, where I'd hope oh if I just do this, or say this, they'll come and put their arm around my shoulder and be the parents I needed them to be. But it doesn't come. I keep hoping for it and then end up betrayed.

How am I supposed to just accept that and move forward? I know this seems terrible but I'm just supposed to allow them to live their whole lives thinking that I was simply a 'bad' child, and even if they did abuse me (which they won't admit to) it was because I deserve it.

578,NipplelessWoman,1613832746,"I have C-PTSD from a plethora of childhood abuse events and other trauma. I moved out at 18, went to a completely different state across the country. I restarted my life and I am in a good place. But the safer I got here, more of my ptsd began to show. After living here 2 years, I finally began to trust my family doctor enough to get some help and try medication. 

However the medication that my pcp prescribed wasn’t enough for the massive amount of trauma I have been through. My pcp recommended a psychiatrist and a EMDR/Trauma therapist who are both excellent. I started EMDR and new meds. I have had even worse symptoms from the therapy and new medications. My sleep over the last two weeks kept getting less and less until I didn’t sleep for three days. I started hallucinating about trauma I have been through. It was the definition of hell. 

I talked to both my therapist and psychiatrist. My therapist has paused EMDR therapy and we are doing regular talk therapy. My psychiatrist has changed/increased my medications. My psychiatrist is working on getting my medications right so I won’t have these episodes. I am meeting with both of them weekly to talk about. I think we are on the right path but it takes time. I’m patient about that. My psychiatrist is trying so hard to find a good mixture on strength of medication. We’ve even used genetic testing and it’s been helpful. Because of the genetic testing, I told my sister about it. She’s still living with my abusive dad who believes that psychology is a fake science. But her OCD has gotten so bad, that my mom begged her to go and see someone. We all have kept it a secret from my dad. I sent my sister my genetic testing and what medications I am currently on for my sisters psychiatrist. 

Well my sisters psychiatrist told her that my Quetiapine, which is used for emergency insomnia moments, is like an opiate. Since we live in a hot spot for the heroin epidemic, my sister was freaking out and talked to my mom about what her psychiatrist told her. They both called to confront me last night about it and asked if I could substitute all my sleeping medications for melatonin. 

I told them that after sleeping only 2-3 hours for two weeks and then followed by three days of no sleep, I think I am passed the point of what melatonin can do. Plus, it was my understanding that Quetiapine is an antipsychotic which is probably beneficial since I hallucinate in my lack of sleep episodes and those hallucinations are always events from my trauma. This most recent episode I was water boarded, shot, and assaulted all over again. It was emotionally exhausting.

I don’t know what to do about my mom and sister’s concerns. My mom won’t talk about my ptsd events if it involved what happened in my family. But she’s fine talking about abuse she feels my dad and her had no part in. I am extremely vulnerable right now and really upset. I don’t know why I care so much about their opinions.

Maybe this is a plea for advice, maybe it's just a rant; I don't know anymore.   


I live in a place that just lengthened the window for reporting childhood sexual assault, and for a year they let victims take it to court, regardless of how long ago it was.   


This is really good, but from a totally selfish perspective, I'm in a really weird place.  As a teenager I was forced to be nearly naked, and then actually naked, and poked and photographed and a lot of not-okay things were said about how I looked by two adults while I cried and begged them to stop.  And the institution this was a part of approved this, and said it was my fault for looking the way I did.  For the next few years I was in really close proximity to them, and reminded that they could do this again if they ever wanted to, and when I tried to tell a Responsible Adult, he would tell me to kill myself.   


Here's the issue, though: it's not sexual assault...?  Because there was no ""sexual intent"" and because one of the people was vaguely related to the medical field.  NOTHING that happened was medically necessary, and in a place where they aren't even allowed to give you Tylenol without parents' permission, somehow this was just okay?    


This is why I didn't report it in the years between being able to leave that place and the statute of limitations running out––because if you read the literal laws, as long as no one is horny, there's nothing wrong with stripping a kid without cause, running your hands inside their underwear to look underneath, threatening them and their future and their parents if they don't stop trying to cover themselves up.  It's not invasion of privacy, it's not assault, it's not sexual assault, it's not even considered sexual contact.

We weren't close growing up but in the past 3 years started talking and turned out we had a lot in common (seemingly). A year ago, I move back to the country I was born in, and they invite me to come live with them. I met a few people through them, in a new city I'd never lived in before. Over the year we lived together, I started to notice a lot of really strange behavior. Also they took advantage of me financially, and a bit before I was about to move out (there had been a few conflicts over the year) I tried to address this matter and everything blew up from there. I had to move out sooner than my new place was ready to move into. 

I've become really close friends with someone I thought they were close with, turns out they aren't, and I was able to open up to this person about the abuse I've endured with my cousin, and thus have this person's support. Well, this person showed me a text message that my cousin had sent, warning about me, saying to be careful with me because I'm a liar and mentally ill. I know those people who'd rather side with my cousin and not find out what actually happened aren't worth my time. But this isn't to say I'm not shaken and angry, and feeling pretty powerless.

I've dealt with this once before, with an ex partner, but I never knew it was happening until I figured it out later on.

589,queegquegsgator,1613820557,"Did anyone else get plunged into a breakdown when receiving an official C-PTSD/ PTSD/ other diagnosis? I just had my very first (phone, thanks to the global covid situation) appointment with an actual psychiatrist (as opposed to therapists), who diagnosed me with PTSD from developmental trauma (since here C-PTSD isn't a ""real"" diagnosis). I was fully expecting that. He also diagnosed me with depression, which, even though I'm fully miserable and feel hopeless and joyless, for some reason never really crystalized for me as something I have. (He recommended Zoloft and trauma-informed CBT, both of which I'm eligible to get for free here because the country I live in right now has good universal health care.) For reasons my brain can't really process, hearing these diagnoses has sent me down a rabbit hole of all of my worst symptoms: dissociation, insomnia, uncontrollable crying fits, rage, self-loathing, panic, etc. etc.

I would have expected to feel relief at a diagnosis. I don't know why the opposite is the case.

Background: I've had various forms of therapy for a decade. For a long time, I did a modality similar to IFS, and in the last couple of years have switched to Somatic Experiencing. I've gone through brief periods (say 4 months max) where I've felt like the horror of developmental trauma was starting to lift, but it always comes crashing down in triggered flashback-led breakdowns and I'm plunged back into the badness again for equivalent periods or longer. During those bright spots, it feels like I'm truly ""in recovery"" from decades of trauma. Right now it doesn't.

If anyone here has had this sort of reaction to an official diagnosis, any theories as to why? How did it turn out for you? (I plan to talk about this with my therapist, but I don't have an appointment for another couple of weeks.) Hearing anyone else's perspective here would be great.

Oh, and I do intend to take the psychiatrist's recommendations. I'm struggling with them even though they're obviously sound, and I don't know why my brain/ body/ system won't accept that I need medication (and more coping skills). It seems cognitively obvious, but on a deep level I'm somehow rejecting it.

So, before I start shitting on my father, I'd like to say that all my life, he has been an exceptional father to me. I couldn't have asked for a better father. I have been very lucky to have super supportive, caring and loving parents. They've done everything that good parents should do and more. 


Now, I am one of those kids whose parents used to beat them. A lot. And for most of those times, I'd say I deserved those beatings. For example, one time I was calling names to our house maid while she was doing our household chores. Like full blown disrespecting her. My dad was taking a shower and was listening everything. He came out and beat the shit out of me. I was pretty young back then. Like 8-9. I didn't know what I did was wrong. And I didn't even know why he was giving me a beating back then. He didn't even explain why he was beating me. I know now


There are a lot of instances where I deserved my parents' beating and I learnt a lot from those. But, there is one instance that I will never be able to forget. So, I was watching some TV in the living room and I got a glorious idea of pranking my mom. Yep, I did it when it wasn't cool. I thought, what if I tell my mom that grandma is calling her and she goes and talks to grandma, and then realises that she didn't actually call her. How funny would that be, right!? Yep..I was stupid but, also young. Don't forget that!


So, I went in her room. She was sleeping and my dad was working on the computer there. I tried to wake her up. She said, ""What happend?"". She said it quite loudly. That grabbed my dad's attention. Now he was also looking at me. That idea didn't seem so glorious then. They were waiting for an answer, which never came. Then my dad asked, ""Why did you wake her up?"". I thought telling him that I was trying to prank my mom wasn't the best idea. I stayed quiet.


He then yelled at me. ""I ASKED YOU SOMETHING!"". I was taken aback. I thought telling him would only make him more mad. I stayed quiet still. _Slap_. ""WHY DID YOU WAKE HER UP!?"". At that time, my grandma came in the room and tried to stop him. He then asked both, my mom and my grandma to leave. Said he'll handle it. They left. Now, I knew there was no one who could save me here. I started crying. He didn't care. He kept hitting me. I kept crying. And I kept quiet because I still thought that telling him the actual reason would only make things worse.


He kept yelling at me and hitting me. ""WHY DID YOU WAKE HER UP!?"". I kept quiet because I didn't know what to say. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore, so I told a half assed reason that I wanted Mom to sit with me while I watch TV. That calmed him down. I kept crying. I couldn't believe that my own dad could act like such a monster, and that too for such a trivial reason. He then hugged me and tried to console me. That made me cry even more. It felt warm. I went all out. I couldn't stop crying


Well, the damage was already done. I still don't understand why he acted the way he did. And this was, hands down, the worst beating I have ever received in my entire life. This one scarred me


I absolutely love my dad and I genuinely appreciate everything he's done for me my entire life. I have entered my 20s and he's still financially supporting me by paying for everything I have, and also for my college tuition. I really want to forget that incident and forgive him for that. But, I can't do either. I am unable to. I don't know what to do.

593,samakkins,1613817683,"So very recently I (22F) have been diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD. I have done therapy in the past before I was diagnosed with these. My previous therapist never mentioned a diagnosis when I went. 

I'm just not sure if what I went through is severe enough to be labeled as C-PTSD. I just feel horrible about invalidating those that do have it. I'm not sure what to think and I wanted to come here after lurking for awhile. 

I grew up with my mom and step dad. My biological dad was NOT present for most of my life, as was probably best. My mom grew up in an extremely abusive household, my dad was extremely abusive, and she turned to alcohol when I began middle school after my younger brother was born. She already had liver problems prior to this, and it caused her to receive a liver transplant a few years ago. She vehemently refuses that she had an alcohol problem and insists it was because of the disease she already had. I've given up on saying otherwise to her face, she's been completely clean and has (somewhat...) become a better mother since I moved states almost two years ago. 

When I hit middle school I realized the family dynamic had changed. I was no longer the only child - I had a way cuter, better, and more loved younger brother instead. The only spot that was left for me was the family scapegoat. Since I had undiagnosed ADHD, once grades mattered and you actually had to STUDY...I tanked hard. My parents couldn't understand how their daughter could be ""so stupid and lazy."" I was heavily verbally abused, threatened, kicked out, and occasionally physically abused (maybe? My mom would hold me in a headlock and slap me, wrestle me to the ground. My step dad would grab my hair and drag me up the stairs once or twice. Idk if that's actual abuse...) for the entirety of middle and high-school, getting progressively worse the older I got. I was grounded nearly all the time for grades, and my parents did nothing to help me besides paying for summer school (which I also failed.) I could never see my friends, and my parents called them all losers. They made me feel like a piece of shit daily. When I was coming home on the bus, sometimes I would cry because I knew what would happen as soon as I walked through that door. I became horribly depressed and suicidal. I was constantly angry and sad, like those were the only emotions they could make me feel. I felt absolutely hated in that house just because I wasn't the perfect daughter they wanted. I even told them I wanted to shoot myself once. They both laughed in my face. I had tears streaming down my cheeks, begging them to understand how scared and alone I was. I can never forget the times I sat in my dark room on the floor, gut-wrenching sobs making me hyperventilate until I just couldn't feel anything anymore. The numbness helped me sleep. Actually, the numbness helped with everything when I was there. If I didn't go numb my body would literally crumble from stress and I would sleep all the time.

595,thequeasydream,1613817199,"I am a little tipsy atm so sorry if this is disorganized.

But growing up I thought I had the best family ever. I was adopted at birth. My parents stayed together, we wasn’t poor by any means, I wasn’t physically abused. Anything I wanted my Dad found a way to get it for me. I went to private school, my Dad bought me a BMW for my first car. Both my parents went to lengths for me that parents should not go for their children. My father was pretty depressed my whole life. Binge-drank when I was very little and occasionally when I got older. It is to my understanding now that he was pretty unhappy being with my Mom, and wanted a divorce when I was a kid. My sister recently told me that one night she got drunk and scratched the hell out of my Dad. 

I was super close to my Mom growing up, she was my best and only friend for the most part. She was my hero. However, I remember sitting in the parking lot of McDonalds as a 12 year old with my Mom asking me what she thought of the way he treated her. I remember her crying to me because he wouldn’t have sex with her. I also remember saying “I AM NOT A ROBOT!!!” to my Mom a lot as a teenager, because she couldn’t handle and still to this day cannot handle even the slightest hint of anger. 

My memories growing up are so blurred to be honest.

And, now that my father is has passed, I see my mother in an entirely different light. Medicated, she is sweet and docile most of the time. Unmedicated, she yells at him, shames him, says things like ""It's your fault"" or ""I'm mad at you!!!"" repeatedly for things a grandmother should not get upset with, the kid's 2 years old. She has called me stupid, retarded, a fucking bitch, a piece of crap, asshole, cruel, mean, nasty, disgusting, ungrateful, selfish, butch, white trash for dressing the way I wanted to (I believe I am gender-fluid, and sometimes dress more masculine), says that she is ashamed I am her daughter. That my dead father would be disgusted with me. Screams, slams doors, has upturned a table on me, locked me out of the house in the rain, threatened to punch me, threatened to kill herself. She has called my sister a whore, slut, and pig. Has a martyr complex, hates most everything. 

And yet here I am as an adult with crippling anxiety and depression. I relate very much to the DAE's on this thread. I am disconnected from most everyone and everything. I have no hobbies or motivation to pursue my interests. I overthink things to the point where I compulsively ask my therapist or strangers on here when I don't want to bother her, for validation before I express my emotions or act. I feel paranoid. I overreact even though I refuse to show that side of me to anyone but my therapist. I try to deny it but I get irrationally jealous. I can go into a rage fit at the drop of a dime. I am in a limerent relationship with my ex who cheated on me. I have no stable sense of self. If someone disapproves of me I spiral into shame, if someone likes me then I soar into over-confidence. I need constant reassurance from people I feel close to, that they are not mad at me or aren't backing away from me, even though I refuse to express it. I rarely cry or laugh out loud. I feel like a parasite for asking for help from anyone. 

My therapist said she thinks with my low self-esteem, need for validation, and control in relationships, that I show signs of some type of abuse growing up. She has mentioned BPD and Bipolar as possible diagnoses.

So, for context, I'm seventeen. I had a surprisingly idyllic early childhood, but that completely stopped once I hit ten. I started showing symptoms of mental illness; my parents brought me to doctor after doctor and none of them could determine what was going on. I stayed in a psychiatric ward for a brief period of time. Nothing any of the psychiatrists did helped; at that point I was suicidal, self-harming and destroying property. Got diagnosed with ODD and OCD, but no medications worked. My mother then started bringing me to alternative medicine practitioners, and I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease and PANDAS. I kept those labels for years afterwards, along with the OCD one. My mother was convinced that I was physically sick, that my behavioral issues were the result of an autoimmune disorder.

Needless to say, they were not. My mother is an extremely controlling, homeschooling parent, and she developed Munchausen's by Proxy. I was the designated ""patient"". I was in and out of psych wards for a few years. My mother took me to literally dozens of doctors and ""doctors"", some of whom were just pure scam artists. I had legitimate problems - but they were neither OCD nor Lyme. I continued being destructive and defiant - I assaulted staff members in the psych wards on numerous occasions. Hitting, spitting, etcetera. One time, I got sent home, and was extremely pleased with myself. Another time I was almost charged with a felony, but the charges were dropped. When I was thirteen, I began torturing and killing small animals (frogs, snakes). This was never addressed, and my mother continued to give me all manner of nonsense ""treatments"", some of which made me nauseous and ill. 

The household was extremely dysfunctional. My siblings and I are all homeschooled, and there were frequent (sometimes physical) altercations between us and our mother. My mother was verbally, emotionally, medically, and sometimes physically abusive. I responded by becoming ever more disregulated, angry, and defiant. Throughout all of this, my mother insisted that I merely had Lyme Disease, and I never received any appropriate therapy or support. I quite literally had no one, and I learned to rely on, trust, and value myself and myself only. 

When I was sixteen, I began torturing cats. This continued for about a year, and my mother never found out about it. I finally got a decent psychiatrist, and eventually told her everything. The household continued to be chaotic and abusive in all directions. My sister abused my youngest brother, I gave my mother a black eye, my other brother hit me, we all screamed at each other, and so on. Absolute dysfunction. I began drinking alcohol at sixteen, and quickly became fond of setting fires. My array of deviant behavior expanded exponentially, and at times I was convinced I would end up killing someone. I wanted to kill myself, too, but knew I wasn't strong enough to commit suicide. 

I'm out of that environment now, but I feel that I'm damaged and incapable of being happy like other people. I want to be normal, and at the same time I resent other teenagers who have had easier lives. Very often I want them to die, so that everything is ""fair"".

He then yelled at me. ""I ASKED YOU SOMETHING!"". I was taken aback. I thought telling him would only make him more mad. I stayed quiet still. _Slap_. ""WHY DID YOU WAKE HER UP!?"". At that time, my grandma came in the room and tried to stop him. He then asked both, my mom and my grandma to leave. Said he'll handle it. They left. Now, I knew there was no one who could save me here. I started crying. He didn't care. He kept hitting me. I kept crying. And I kept quiet because I still thought that telling him the actual reason would only make things worse.


He kept yelling at me and hitting me. ""WHY DID YOU WAKE HER UP!?"". I kept quiet because I didn't know what to say. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore, so I told a half assed reason that I wanted Mom to sit with me while I watch TV. That calmed him down. I kept crying. I couldn't believe that my own dad could act like such a monster, and that too for such a trivial reason. He then hugged me and tried to console me. That made me cry even more. It felt warm. I went all out. I couldn't stop crying


Well, the damage was already done. I still don't understand why he acted the way he did. And this was, hands down, the worst beating I have ever received in my entire life. This one kind of scarred me


I absolutely love my dad and I genuinely appreciate everything he's done for me my entire life. I have entered my 20s and he's still financially supporting me by paying for everything I have, and also for my college tuition. I really want to forget that incident and forgive him for that. But, I can't do either. I am unable to. I don't know what to do.

My girlfriend gets these too but I don't think she realized what they were until recently. Clover immediately got up and asked to go outside.

607,juicytyce,1613807508,"I grew up in a religious cult during my childhood. And some of the things they did was messed up. I am now starting to seek treatment for the trauma that I have gone through but verbally talking about it is hard. I can't say much about it without breaking down and I don't know how to tell my psych if I just end up a blubbering anxious mess in the end.

My parents or family members used to beat us religiously. When we made mistakes while studying we would get beat for that also. They used to tell us that they are doing it because they love us. I remember being caned because someone had put water in the dishwashing soap. My dad said if no one owns up then all of us were gonna get caned. And I ended up owning up so that my sibling's and I didn't get beat. My dad would cane us with such force that we would be covered in welts and bruises. I find myself trying to justify his actions, ""maybe I was actually a really bad child so I deserved it"". 

I remember having to watch my brother get punished. My Grandad told us that we had to watch because we need to understand that his 'soul must be saved from sin'. They would fry gravel or hard rice in a frying pan and make him kneel on it for at least an hour. By that time his knees looked horrid and I remember wanting to tell them to stop because it's hurting him and being made to watch made it worse. But I couldn't because I knew they would beat me too. I wish I didn't have to watch him cry in pain whenever they did it because I couldn't do anything. 

They use to strip us naked from the waist down and cane us while we were told to kneel. In the end we would be thrashing around screaming in pain but they didn't stop until they felt like it was 'enough'.

The physical abuse went on till I was 13, but the emotional abuse went on till I was 18.

They would tell me that they loved me but I couldn't believe it. In my child mind I would think ""why would you beat me if you loved me?"" Or "" Maybe I'm actually demonised"". Saying 'I love you' makes me feel so skewed inside. To this day I can only say 'I love you' in text without feeling so conflicted. Saying it out loud is like saying something foreign even if I know that I mean it. I currently struggle in my relationships because I feel mistrustful, I sometimes wonder if my love is legitimate or if this is ""actually love"". I know that I would die for my SO if I had to but the word 'love' brings me a great deal of inner conflict. I just want to be able to fully trust in someone without feeling like they are trying to do something to hurt me. I want to be able to be fully intimate with my partner but it's so hard. I am usually unable to be open with my feelings and I bottle them up inside, it makes my SO upset because I can't tell him how I feel. I wish I could but that was something I couldn't do when I was growing up because they'd react angrily or they'd beat me/ pray for me until the demon went away. Even though they can't physically hurt me anymore the fear of having to tell someone my feelings is still there. I feel like I have to protect myself.

Everyone was so quick to point out how well behaved we were and how lovely we were at family gatherings or church events, and that would just make me want to die inside. We'd just politely thank them and move on because we knew that we had to behave a certain way or we would get caned once we got home.

I try to justify that because I didn't grow up on the streets or in poverty that it wasn't really abuse. I'm probably just invalidating myself but that's what I was raised to believe. My parents would tell me that I should be grateful because I'm not starving and that I don't live in a broken family. 

I know this family is broken and I see it in my siblings everyday. 

I recently reconnected with my cousin after 16 years, she went through the same thing and it hurts to know that anyone would do something like that to her. It makes me so sad. I want to be strong for her and try to seek help because I don't want to live in fear like this anymore. My psychiatrist reccomended me a psych that specialises in truama, ADHD and PTSD.

I have BPD and CPTSD and have only ever experiences love as obsession or extreme, infantile idealization/ attachment.

The thing is that *know* that I’m idealizing and projecting all of these infantile longings and fantasies onto someone, that they aren’t as absolutely perfect as in my head and that however wonderful they are, I’m not actually seeing or loving the “real” them (which is unfair to them), yet I feel like I just can’t do anything else.

I think I'm probably overreacting about things but I wanted a second opinion.

So, I have a friend that was emotional and physically abused and I was sexually abused but not the other two. Something that happens a lot is that when they're feeling invalidated about how people don't take their trauma seriously (and I completely agree that emotional and physical abuse isn't taken as seriously as it should be) they start venting about how people who were sexually abused are taken so much more seriously and get a lot more support. 

I get that they're frustrated and it's hard but it's starting to get really hurtful. At least in my experience, sexual abuse is taken seriously in that if you bring it up people immediately talk about how you made the conversation too dark or too depressing and seriously in that people believe sometimes only that monsters would be sexually abusive so they'll never believe their friends or people they like could be rapists/abusers. But in terms of actual meaningful support, it's very rare. I still have to deal with people messaging me whenever I post about my abuse telling me how they got off to it and how hot it was, doctors who mock me for it, and a lot of other things. And it feels like not only do I have to deal with these things and the lack of support, I have to be apologetic for getting any support that I do.

I've tried to bring it up before but I just kind of get knocked back down and told that people need the chance to vent. But it hurts.

612,marginally_soft,1613801687," I've been seeing a trauma therapist for about 8 months now. I grew up in a home with an emotionally abusive mom and a dad who enabled her. My needs, wants, and interests were bottom of the barrel priorities for them. Love was conditional. As a result, I became an adult with an anxious attachment style and incredible difficulties communicating needs, wants or even allowing myself to feel like I wanted or needed something. I became a caregiver type person and have had to learn from ground 0 how to make sure my needs are met, too.

I'm getting to a heavy point in therapy that's been really challenging. I'm addressing the toxic traits I picked up surviving my childhood and young adult life and learning to communicate what I need. It feels bad, though. Like really bad. I feel like I'm suddenly asking for too much. I fear I'm becoming my mother. My anxious attachment issues feel like they've gotten more intense, but I'm communicating with my wife (who is supportive and patient and wonderful) as best as I can about my brain shit right now at least...?? I'm having breakdowns all the time about things regarding my mom and my own fear of abandonment shit. I'm having so many emotional flashbacks and memories I haven't thought about in years are frequently hitting me like a train.

Is this supposed to happen? Is it supposed to feel like I'm crumbling? Am I just supposed to put the pieces back together again in a better way? What is happening to me right now? I feel like I'm drowning in emotional hurt and fear and anger from my childhood so much of the time. I'm starting to ask for things I need (like quality time, help with chores, etc.) but it feels so *terrible*. The guilt is overwhelming, but I'm just so *tired* from being caregiver for so long that I'm desperate for help now. Will it become more natural over time?

I’ve felt depressed, isolated, unmotivated, and detached.

I haven’t been able to gather the courage to speak once in one of my classes and have a 0 for participation that’s 25% of our grade.  This sounds dumb, but I really cannot get myself to speak or turn on my camera when I have a male professor.  It’s like this in person, but even worse online because I can just turn my camera off and mute myself and it’s like I can disappear like I have always wanted.

Then we had a huge assignment due and I just could not do it.  I’ve felt really detached and didn’t even realize it was the due date already until the day before.  I’ve felt so numb and depressed that I can barely get out of bed and only muster up enough energy to do homework occasionally.  This paper was so much and I couldn’t do it.

It’s also a writing class and our story is critiqued in front of us for like an hour of the class.  I froze and couldn’t get myself to write knowing that.

Anyways, it is a zero according to the syllabus if it is late.  I think I just failed the class.

I’ve had a 3.9 GPA so far after bombing high school due to currently going through trauma at home.  It killed me to have bad grades because I loved school and I wanted to make it to college.  I promised myself I wouldn’t mess up again in college, but here I am.

This professor is a hard ass and made it so clear on the syllabus that late work is a no and extensions require formal documentation.  I don’t think he’s educated in trauma or mental health or that he cares given that he has used triggered as a joke before and has thrown around other terms as jokes.

614,braingobrrrrrrrr,1613800514,"I decided during an especially focused period of time, that I was tired ducking around my shit and being evasive in therapy just because it's so hard for me to really confront my emotions. I wrote down, starting from early childhood, memories that come to mind, and personality traits I had just as I thought of them. It's definitely not a complete picture, but it's probably more than I could ever tell her during our sessions. 

A lot of my CPTSD is from when I was in middle school thru high school, but writing down from early childhood made me realize or maybe re-remember a lot of my really strange and emotionally intense behavior. My mom was saying for a bit that she thought my sister, and possibly me, had been sexually abused when we were very young, but everyone shot her down because there was a lot of fighting and court battles and she has paranoid delusions and everyone (me included) just thought that she was making stuff up. But honestly, looking at my behavior as a small child (elementary school age), I check a lot of the boxes for CSA. I don't want to think about it. I don't remember anything bad, but I don't like thinking of that part of my life. I mean, partially because I have so few memories. Up until I hit about 11, my memory is absolute shit just huge holes everywhere, but I can remember some standard feelings I felt from the time and actual things that I did from what I was told by my parents or acute memories. It could be undiagnosed autism (that still might be a thing); but I also started masturbating when I was only 6 years old (I had not idea that that's what I was doing until I was a teenager). 

Well, my therapist messaged me back saying she wants to start our next session focusing the first page I wrote which is basically all this early childhood shit, and I regret showing her it so much. I have so much shame and embarrassment over it. I feel like I am making it up and that I wasn't actually acting like this or exhibiting this very suspiciously CSA behavior.

644,leckycherms,1613785752,"I am having trouble understanding dissociation and if this is something I experience.  I feel like the things I read about dissociation online are very distinct and extreme whereas my issues seem to be subtle and ongoing.

Firstly, I feel a disconnect with time.

Often days fly by incredibly fast for me.  I can wake up and do an activity and suddenly hours has gone by and I’ve just done a whole lot of nothing.

The same goes for weeks or months.  I don’t understand where time goes.

This causes a lot of problems in my life.  I often read an email or text message and sometimes days or weeks will go by and I get a followup message, angry at me for not responding.  I’m initially confused by these messages, because to me, it feels like I just read these.  Then I feel horrible and irresponsible, yet it happens again and again.

I often plan to eat lunch and then realize it is now 4 hours past lunch time.

I plan my day, then end up missing most things on my to-do list because the day has ended when it only just began.

I don’t know where this time goes.

Yet I also feel conscious when this happens.  It’s not like I’m forgetting what I am doing and stare into space for days at a time.  I know what I did today, but I don’t know why it’s so distorted and why it took so much time.

Today I woke up, took a swim, came back and took an exam, decided to lay with my cat, read a bit, and check social media before I took a post-swim shower and ate lunch, and boom, it’s now 8pm.  I woke up at 8:30am.  I had an entire 10 page paper I wanted to write today and so much more.

This hurts my grades too because I have weeks to work on a big project and suddenly they’re gone.  The 10 page paper I have to do was due yesterday.  Late assignments pile up because I don’t realize how much time has passed since they were due.  

I sometimes mean to go to bed after only staying up for a bit and suddenly the sun is rising.  

I have removed distractions from my life like social media, reddit, games, etc. for a week or two to see if those were the problems, yet this still happens with or without those things.

I also can find myself just wanting to stare into space for bits or not wanting to take in information.  Even when I am not tired I want to spend a couple hours a day laying in bed and doing nothing, taking in nothing.  It’s like my brain needs to check out and if I don’t, it won’t focus.

I do occasionally go through phases where I believe life is unreal, but I also believe there is truth to that.  I think about how it makes no sense that we exist and spiral into not feel like me or anyone around me is real.  It all feels so fake.  This is especially true with covid isolation, but it has happened badly before covid too. 

I’m also really confused by dissociated identities.  I don’t think I have DID because they aren’t extreme at all, but if I really analyze myself, I recognize that I have incredibly distinct personalities in certain situations.

Around adults or authority figures, I am mute, submissive, shy, awkward, careful, and act exactly how I did while being abused.

Around people I am very close to, I am talkative, silly, say whatever comes to mind, laughable, and carefree.

Then I definitely have different “moods” I can get into.

Sometimes I can be extremely self hating and just be swallowed into this world of isolation and see the entire world differently.

Sometimes I can be incredibly talkative and spontaneous and goofy and not be afraid.

Sometimes I can go almost entirely mute and be quiet and gentle and see everything in a soft way.

Sometimes I can talk like a child a bit, but I mostly assumed I was doing this to be funny.

Sometimes I can be super organized and into school and other times I can not care.

I also have a name that is frequently shortened and that frequently has a nickname which I grew up with.  Let’s say my full name is Samantha and my nickname is Sam for the sake of my identity.  I’ve recently noticed that I use different nicknames for different people, moods, or situations.

People who are near my age, who I am outgoing with, call me Sam.  I sign my name as Sam on things when I feel outgoing or childish.

Adults or people of authority know me as Samantha.  I sign my name as Samantha when feeling quiet or small.

I cannot even begin to explain how starkly different these personalities are from each other.  When someone sees me around my friends for the first time, they’re extremely shocked.  Likewise, when my friends see me around adults I don’t know, they ask why I am acting so weird.

Is this just a reaction to trauma (for example my abuse was from an adult therefore I am more timid and formal around them) or do I have some sort of divided personality traits.

646,HereToLime,1613784981,"So growing up, I experienced a lot of what people would consider to be serious abuse, but weirdly enough, it feels like the most traumatizing thing was the disregarding of boundaries. I have ADHD so I've always been very sensitive, and I hated people touching me/tickling me/hugging me, etc. I also grew to hate adults who touched kids without their consent even in these ""innocuous"" ways, like I'd go into full meltdown/rage mode and have to be carried away. These times are what I get intrusive thoughts/nightmares about the most. 

So my family ""respected"" my wish to not be touched, by not touching me. But they would THREATEN to touch me, because it was funny for them to see me scared. They would make jokes about how upset I would get. This gave me so much shame about being traumatized by the lack of boundaries that I vowed to never speak about it to anyone, I'd never show that kind of vulnerability. I wanted to kill myself by the age of 7 because of these things. It's only in the last 6 or so months that I was able to write down a bit of this and hand it to my therapist (with shaking hands). I feel like her validating, kind response actually made a difference with my intrusive thoughts/memories. They're not quite as sharp and painful. 

And now I'm imagining - what if just ONE person had said to 7 year old me, ""hey, I know it feels really scary to not be listened to. That must make you so mad. You know, it's okay to not want people to touch you. It's your body, and they should care about what you want. I'm so sorry that your family likes to scare you.""

I recently received this message from a friend when explaining my disconnect from others and my need for a healing relationship. my argument was that a lot of the pain of CPTSD is, for me, feeling chronically disconnected from other people. I said that the antidote to a damaging relationship is a healthy one. This was their response: 

‘Who is carrying the wound? If you can have a healing relationship with yourself is there a need for another? It then becomes a choice. You carry your pain with you like a suitcase. It is so heavy, why not put it down for a while, sit down and take a breather. You are no longer who you were, so walk on without it.’ 

This is a close friend, but their response made me angry, and then very sad. I don’t know whether what they’re saying is a misunderstanding, and I feel angry/sad about not feeling seen/heard OR whether they are giving me a little bit of truth which I don’t want to accept. Am I stuck in the victim mentality? probably. Learned helplessness is also a big issue of mine. 

I can totally see how their advice would apply in some ways, just perhaps not to childhood trauma. What do you think? I can’t work out how I am really feeling. I am doubting myself. this is someone who I respect a lot.

Spilled water on the charger for my vape’s batteries. I’m usually much more careful. I’d usually see the spill potential before it happened and prevent it.

Made a bad decision about a dental thing and have to see the dentist again. Trying to communicate with the dentist about what happened was difficult, confusing, and embarrassing. 

Tried using an already empty gift card at a restaurant. A small mistake, but the feeling stupid is about when the waiter told me. My thoughts were all jumbled and I couldn’t communicate. 

Today, I made assumptions about a problem with my dog, and I may have ended up getting a vet consultation for free because of it. Again it was difficult, confusing, and embarrassing. But this one bothers me most and it might be because of not having to pay. I’m not even sure how to explain the situation. What I know is I’ve cried off and on about this all day since. 

After the vet, I completely forgot I told someone I’d pick something up from them. It was 2 hours later that I remembered. 

Growing up, my parents demanded I be perfect and so I was (or so I thought). Being smart was more important than anything, and so I became smart (or so I thought). I got good grades and believed I was smart because of it. It’s probably trauma that kept me from understanding everything I memorized, but even with the reason being no fault of mine it’s so hard to be at the point where I feel so stupid. Now my memory sucks. 

Evil forking parents and your crazy bad selfishness. I hate you. You made me distort reality in order to exist, to survive your bullshit. Now I’m undoing it and it’s scary and confusing and I don’t deserve this.

Here’s what happened and it probably doesn’t sound like a big deal but I’m still freaking out. 

I just got off work and went to a gas station to use an atm. I was walking out the door and a car was driving next to me. I stopped and waited for it to go so I could pass &amp; the driver waved for me to go. 

A man who I don’t know at all went up to the driver, pointed at me &amp; yelled “You should have ran her over!” and laughed. 

I yelled back at him, “That’s really mean. Why would you say that?” 

He yells back “It was just a joke! Learn to take a joke! Take a joke!” 

I yell back “It wasn’t funny!” 

He yells, “Okay Karen!” Then he turned to whoever was in his car and said, “What a crazy bitch” 

At this point, I just walked away. 

About 10 years ago, I actually was almost run over. I think this exchange just triggered all that.  A person who I am no longer in contact with had yanked me out of his car, threw me on the road, pulled off and then reversed, almost running me over. He braked right before hitting me. I’m very lucky to be alive and to not have any injuries. 

I’m trying so hard to fight these feelings because I know it’s just my brain playing tricks but it really feels like no one would give any cares if I actually was ran over or died.

658,Acrobatic-Ad-5292,1613781079,"I recently moved back in with my mom (I’m 25) after living on my own for three years. I used to work full time and was completely independent until covid came. I lost my job and never financially recovered. I’m absolutely grateful for my mom telling me I could come back home, and glad to help her around the home, but lately I’ve felt really bad about myself. 

I don’t mind helping and I want to contribute. But now she’s gotten back into an old habit of constantly telling me to do things in the manner of which someone would tell a servant. First thing in the morning there is no “hey good morning” or “how’d you sleep” it’s always “I need you to do a, b, and c for me today.” Always in a hostile manner as if she’s already upset. 

I don’t mind being given things to do but sometimes I need to do things for myself too. I like to take time to myself to paint, read or garden. The gardening tends to be part of the yard work here as well. If I’m taking time alone in my camper, she calls me and asks what I’m doing and then tells me I need to do something to help her because I’m not being productive. She doesn’t say thank you, please or if I have something else to do. I end up feeling like shit because whatever I’m doing isn’t “productive” to her, even when it’s for my own mental health. And it’s not like I’m lazy or don’t pull my weight. I can’t even have one day of self care without her rolling her eyes and scoffing at me saying I’m “having a lazy day”.  

Today was raining all day, dreary, cold, and I woke up to a bad mood swing and just felt depressed all day. I have bipolar 2 disorder. I wanted to be alone and decompress. I came to the kitchen to get coffee and first thing I hear is “I need you to help me clean out the horse’s water buckets, wash the dog, and clean the horse stalls”. There is no good morning. It makes me feel like I’m good for nothing but manual labor and that’s all she wants me here for. 

I lived on my own and worked full time for years and so being treated like this has brought about a lot of old resentment that I had worked through. She makes me feel like anything I do that isn’t for her is useless and she scoffs whenever I say I’m tired as though I have no reason to be. She gets angry whenever I try to defend myself or communicate that I need a moment to myself. She gets highly defensive about my tone even though I match hers. 

I’ve had friends get very uncomfortable with how she speaks to me and one even said “That’s abusive language and tone...a mother shouldn’t be talking to her kid like that especially in front of others.” When I brought it up to my mom, she went into a rage. 

I don’t know what else to do but stay out of her way and isolate myself. I don’t want to but every time she speaks to me it’s in a condescending or angry tone. I feel like I’m a burden here now. Even my step dad gets on her at times about how she speaks to me and then she plays the victim as if we are ganging up on her.

When I get triggered I cry and often feel ""mildly"" suicidal internally and I really want my partner to cuddle me and be around me and talk to me for 10-15 minutes. When this happens I feel alright pretty quickly. He usually is ok with helping me. This post is coming from my own worries about damaging him by needing too much help.

Unfortunately sometimes I get triggered a lot. For the past 30 days I've been going off like a gun into tears and shaking at the slightest thing. What is a normal reasonable healthy amount of support to ask for? 

Am I allowed to ask for a hug every time I get triggered if it happens once every two days for 15 minutes over a month long period? Does that sound ok or is it going to cause damage? I literally have no idea what is normal re this. 

If my amount of preferred support I mentioned isn't too much, what is too much? For background, I grew up being emotionally neglected and physically abused.

My story is extremely long and complicated so I'll get to the gist of my symptoms, I have a lot of problems reacting to stress and it often triggers a f-f-f-f response, usually freeze or fight. I dont have visual flashbacks, all flashbacks are emotional flashbacks that I feel in my body. 

An example of a problem this can cause; somebody could ask me a question as simple as ""are you going to study tonight?"" and even when asking nicely, I react extremely disproportionate to the situation. I get extremely defensive for no reason, and it can even demotivate me to the point that I dont want to do the planned task anymore (as I already planned on studying before being asked).

661,NaomiPands,1613779319,"I don't have memories of any childhood abuse. My therapist has been talking to me about dissociation and trauma, I do believe she's alluding to PTSD. I asked my older brother about our childhood and he mentioned one of my father's partners throwing plates, being drunk, etc. And I can't remember any of it.

Additionally, I started reading ""The Body Keeps Score"" and while reading the end of the first chapter (I believe it's about CSA), I remembered these 2 dreams I had when I was younger than the plate throwing bullshit. (I do want to say, these dreams have stuck with me as a memory from my childhood, I just thought of them after not for a while). They're pretty extreme, especially for a 3-5 yo child. One was how these two men crushed and blended me up and poured me into an ice cube tray and froze me as ice. The other was how a penis was wrapping around my body and I was trapped. I know dreams don't necessarily mean anything and my parents were splitting up around that time, mum was also dating new men. I also have a memory of my father shoving dirty socks into my brother's mouth while we were playing in his room.

I don't know if I was, but I've always had an inkling that I was sexually abused (the dreams mixed with overly sexual activity with masturbation and touching other children). At the same time, I feel like I'm making it up for attention and that nothing happened. I haven't told anyone these thoughts, I've been heavily dissociating and having extreme suicidal ideation, to the point I've started planning and I just feel like I'm lying and doing it for attention.

Just looking at some photos I see that I had scars and scratches on my face and arms. So it was bad. 

I obviously am having a hard time in my life as an adult, and it just hurts so much that it’s always going to be “my” fault for being unreasonable and disturbed despite my family really giving me no option, now in order to love them I have to hate myself to make my brain logic function. I don’t know how to let my family die( mentally) but it kinda feels like that’s what’s happening. 

Sometimes I still doubt myself because my family is really alienating and even if I get close to the topic they are extremely defensive. 

I have a photo I found of myself with scratches all over my face at 4 years old, I look at it once in a while to remind myself what happened wasn’t my fault and it’s disgusting that they blamed me for not defending myself and punished me when I tried to.

For context: they have real anger problems that cause them to blow up at their partner (who also lives with us and who I knew prior to moving in) over the smallest things. They fight pretty regularly and it's always a yelling match where the roommate in question slams doors or fists on the walls, tables, counters, etc. They are also very manipulative of their partner. I recognize this because I just got out of an incredibly toxic relationship and it's unsettling to witness the same things that happened to me happen to a friend. 

It reminds me of living with my parents, down to the anxiety that wells up when it comes close to them coming home. It reminds me of living with my ex, down to the need to please and make others comfortable before I do so for myself. 

Beyond that, I pretty much hole up in my room. They decorated the whole place with their furniture and after seeing how my roommate yells at their partner for the smallest messes, I refuse to use anything of theirs and obsessively clean up after myself if I do. I don't use the kitchen much either. I try to use earphones as much as possible so I can't hear anything in case they do fight. Even if they're not fighting, I find myself assuming that they're complaining about me which only digs me into a hole that I can't cope my way through. 

I told them about my CPTSD diagnosis and try to communicate how I'm feeling and/or why I do certain things that may seem ""strange"" because I know my behavior might come off as disliking them. I s'pose it's my effort to make them comfortable because they have never experienced living with a \*diagnosed\* mentally ill person. Still, they definitely talk about how I'm ""defining myself"" by my illness and ""talk about it way too much"" - I've heard this verbatim. They've also said that I'm ""selfish"" and ""only think about myself,"" but I feel like I'm going out of my way to make them comfortable and ignoring my own needs in the process. 

I'm just wondering if I should call it quits and move out. I'm suffering, but I also recognize that ""normal"" people would probably just grin and bear it until the lease is up, though that's in 6+ months. Right now I feel able to handle it- they fought recently and I got myself through it - but I know that one of these days I might get accidentally triggered and lose months of my life once again.

I think I can see how this situation may have developed and how these obsessive-compulsive traits were useful to me in the past, but things have gone way too far. It has consumed my life.

Sometimes I wish my life would just end so this would stop. Other times, I worry I’ll die having achieved little to nothing worthwhile. Such ambivalence. Not to mention kind of pointless thought, since it looks like I’m going to live for a while yet. I’m full of regret.",CPTSD,Overthinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lnr88x/overthinking/,1613742395.0
673,m_eye_nd,1613771077,"I just watched a short YouTube clip on Peter Levine’s work with a former solider who has ptsd from being in two explosions. He has a form of Tourette’s where he involuntarily jerks his body; specifically his chin, neck and shoulders. Peter Levine explains that trauma is held in the body and uses somatic experiencing therapy to deal with this. He explained that this mans body jerking is representative of what his body would have done back then during the trauma (explosions); flinched. He used an exercise of slowly opening the jaw to interrupt the jerking and it seemed to have a positive affect.   

Even though I’m aware of the body holding onto past trauma, I realised just how much that plays a part in my life. Like most of you, I clench my jaw and I do it 24/7 unless I remind myself not to. I also “hold onto” my body, either wrapping my arms around my chest or using one hand to clasp onto my other wrist. And I do so quite firmly without realising. I also get restless legs where I have to move them about a lot especially when laying in bed. What Peter said about that man’s body movements being similar to what he would have done during the explosions, set a lightbulb off for me. The way I tense up in my body is exactly what I would have done when I suffered various traumatic experiences. I would have clenched my jaw, held onto my body as a protective stance and I feel maybe the restless legs are the fact I wanted to run away in the moment and felt helpless to do so, therefore the energy left pent up in my legs and I froze. 

I find it fascinating that the body remembers even if we choose not to. I also just wish I could release my body from all of this tension forever. I have done things such as dabbled in drugs even to get temporary relief (I don’t do this now). 

Just like all of us, I’m haunted with that same question everyday - who would I be had I not have experienced that trauma? And with that comes, how would I feel? How would I carry my body and it carry me? How would I hold myself up? 

I also wonder if those who haven’t experienced significant trauma in life feel tense more than not in life... or are there really people out there who just feel loose and free? Can you imagine how amazing that would be...  

I often come across as stuck up, stand off-ish and disinterested when people first meet me, as my friends have all told me. I know that’s just my bodies way of saying stay away from me because I’m scared of people. I know that I am very uptight and reserved and it’s because I fear if I really was to let go that all the trauma would come flooding through me and I wouldn’t be equipped to deal with it all. One day I hope I get to a point where I can let it all out. And I pray the most that I’ll be accepted for it all when I do and that I’ll be validated. But for now it’s the most terrifying thought in the world, so I’ll continue to go about life like I’m still living in my own war-zone.",CPTSD,"The body truly does hold onto trauma.

674,woahwaitreally20,1613771041,"My parents would tell you that they love me unconditionally. In fact, I think most parents would. I think my parents believe that a byproduct of procreation is unconditional love. “You always love your kid” that kind of thing. 

I think my parents also think that unconditional love is like a light switch. Once it’s in the “on” position, it’s always on. Once you unconditionally love someone, you always do. 

None of this is true. Unconditional love is not some automatic set-it-and-forget-it concept. 

Unconditional love is a CHOICE and you have to choose it over and over and over again. You have choose to accept and love someone for who they are not once, but every single day. 

I finally get why they say love is a verb. Unconditional love is an act, not a declaration. 

You have to choose unconditional love on their worst days. You have to choose it when they’re annoying you. You have to choose it when they disappoint you. You have to choose it when they anger you. You have to choose it when they hurt you. And making that choice means ACTION. 

My parents would say we love you unconditionally...if you live up to the version of you we have in our heads. 

If you don’t, we don’t want to hear about it. Don’t tell us. We will plug my ears and scream so we don’t hear. We will try to change you to fit the version of you we are comfortable with. 

I feel sorry for my parents that they never got to know me - their insecurity wouldn’t let them. They could only get to know the version of me they had in their heads. 

And it makes me sad that I guess I’ve never known unconditional love. No one has ever just accepted me for who I am. 

I guess I have to be the one to do it. I have to accept myself for who I am. I’ve always felt lonely, but I don’t know, having to be the only one who loves and accepts me is a new level of “on my own” I feel.

I haven’t talked about this with no one but I wonder if that’s why I’m so fucked up. I have all this stored in my brain I can’t make room for the good things in life. My earliest memory of domestic violence was the night before my first day of kindergarten. I’m 22 now. Anyways I woke up in the middle of the night to bright lights and my mom screaming and crying. Saying “hey look what your dads doing!” I shared a bed with my younger sister. There was my step dad. Blacked out of it walking back and forth in his shorts with his shot gun. My moms eye was already bruising from being hit. He kept repeating my name saying “your all going to die because your moms a dumb bitch” “should I just shoot my self so you won’t have to deal me anymore” “I’m going to shoot your mom right in front of you.” It went on all night while we hugged my mom crying. As the sun came up my mom told us to lay down even though my step dad was still sitting in front of us with his shot gun. We closed our eyes not knowing if we’d ever open them again. A lot to comprehend for a kindergarten and head start mid right? Awhile later we were woken up again by mom. She was getting us up to get ready for school. She bathed us, fixed our hair and dropped us off at school. We rode the bus home and that was that. We didn’t talk about it on the ride to school or when we got home. My mom and step dad acted like nothing happened. It felt like a awful dream. We still haven’t talked about it to this day. It eats me alive wondering how I went to school and acted like a normal kid when I had come from a horrible nightmare that night before. Anyways. I have tons of stories to tell similar to this.

683,IndecisiveButDeadly,1613765401,"I normally post and comment here quite a lot but as I am planning on including more personal details in this post than I normally do, I wanted to use one of my spare throwaways.

(this is a long post. **Blanket trigger warnings for: Mention of CSA, mentions of incest, covert incest, emotional abuse, threatening stuff, harrassment...** Did I get it all? Please tell me if I forgot a tw. I go into a lot of detail. I tried to type TW in bold next to the part that mention csa or the idea of it.)

I ended up moving states at the beginning of the pandemic and as a result isolated myself from most of my support system. At the time it was a good option as I worked in one the the industries that was being impacted the worst by covid, and I wasn't making enough to live on, nor was I able to get unemployment. The downside to this was that I would be moving back to the exact place where most of the abuse had taken place and where my father resided. I would not be living with him, however, so I felt like I could deal.

I had something bad happen to me a few months after this move and I found myself unable to cope. Of course I'd been in bad situations in the past and got through them, but my threshold was already lowered and my ability to cope with this thing that happened just... Wasn't there. At the time I was also still hoping (almost against my will) that my dad would change. I thought, for some reason, that even though I was scared shitless of being in my hometown, living in the same location as him would finally make him see me as a real person. I'd gone no contact with him a few years prior to this due to some awful shit he pulled but I was still having a hard time trusting my own perception of things. My relationship with my dad had always been very complicated and enmeshed and unhealthy, and I have no siblings and my mother died years ago, so I had no other point of reference other than how he treated her during their marriage, which was quite badly. It was definitely, definitely an abusive marriage. 

I started visiting this subreddit during that initial period of NC I referenced earlier, and it ended up being an absolute lifesaver. I started being able to untangle things and I figured out that my father was an abusive person. I ended up getting back in contact with him months later due to outside circumstances, but with newfound knowledge.

It has only been recently, after being quarantined with him, that I am finally able to trust my perception of how he acts toward me without talking myself out of it. I notice over and over that yes, he does call me names. He threatens me (he's never followed through, but he certainly gets in my face and slams things around and occasionally throws shit) and has done so my entire life. He sees me as his therapist and since I've stopped doing my ""job"" and put up some boundaries around what I can and can't talk to him about, he really seems to dislike me, if not outright hate me. I try very hard to keep conversations civil and polite and it works out okay sometimes-- that's the thing, it's always been the thing with him. He'll be nice and conversational and okay to be around, but then a switch will flip or I'll feel an ominous tension in the air as familiar as the back of my hand and he'll hate me again. He'll say I'm childish and stupid or he'll bang on my door so hard it shakes in the frame, or he'll get in my face or not let me leave the room. 

I feel fucking scared to be writing all this out because my sense of ""it's not my fault when he rages at me"" is fragile and besides writing all this down here makes me sound... helpless? I'm not helpless, I've left before, I've gotten therapy before, I made a support network, but I also want to accept and see clearly what he actually does and how much he actually scares me. The reason I went NC with him before was because he was threatening to call the cops after I didn't call him for a few days and he was calling my work phone multiple times a day and talking to my coworkers and, eventually, sending me what were essentially breakup letters. Literally the only reason he acted this way was because I didn't call him for five days, and the reason I hadn't called him was because I needed a break from calling him every day. Seeing his behavior (and having others witness it) so clearly was a big turning point for me, but it still wasn't enough to convince me at the time, because that was what I was used to, so I'm really trying to hammer it into myself now so I don't get into this situation again.

After the bad thing happened a few months ago, I kind of... tripped and fell back into living with him. I spent more and more time at his house until I was living with him again, and he seemed happy to have me around at first. My other support system that I had to rely on here outside of him kind of fell apart for me, though, and he turned a corner and started doing the things he'd done in my childhood. Intimidating me, calling me names, becoming enraged when I said no to something, that kind of thing. I remember trying one last time to have a conversation with him about this and I didn't want him to treat me this way and how it hurts me his words were ""you're not going to change me."" Truer words have not been spoken, yeah? I don't want to try to change him, now, I just want to get through this somewhat intact.

After I fell back into living with him, our state was the number one worst place for covid for quite a while and the death rate was very high here, so I didn't feel like I should go out and get a job as he is vulnerable and I could potentially endanger him my working the kind of jobs I'd be qualified for. So I have less than no money because  I spent all of it moving here, and I landed myself in quite a bit of debt besides due to some medical and credit card expenses, and my car got fucked by something else almost as soon as I got here. It may be fixable, I'm not sure. I want that to be my next project but I can't fucking hold onto anything. 

I've sobered up in the month or so, as when I first started living with him I fell into my alcoholism quite hard and do not recall a period of three months or so where I was not drunk, drinking, or hungover. I realized eventually that I would not be able to leave if I kept doing this so I tapered off. I'm not 100% sober now, but I do not allow myself to get drunk anymore. It's helped me feel a lot saner.

I keep losing time and fuzzing in and out of reality-- of the 4 F's, I'm most predominantly a freeze type. I dissociate a lot, and that combined with probable ADHD (it runs in my family) or whatever the fuck it is that makes me forget everything all the time unless it's right in front of me and fucked me up in school have made me feel like I can't ""steer"" things very well. Observing the way my brain works and trying to have compassion for it have helped, but it's slow going.

Basically, he just springs things on me, though. I used to say, ""can we talk about this later?"" Or, ""please don't call me that"" but I have no more energy. I try to start a conversation about something surface-level and pleasant because if I don't talk to him at all he becomes extremely angry toward me, but then he becomes angry that I'm talking to him about the thing I'm talking about because he wants to have a relationship the way we had one before. That relationship fucking destroyed me and I don't want it. I'm tired. Here is what our relationship was like before I moved in with him again:

\-calling him multiple times a day, every day

\-him telling me about women he's dating and his sex life and me being his relationship counselor in hours-long conversations

\-him talking to me about his abusive father and his family

And earlier, before and right after my mom died:

\-me feeling like I couldn't live with or without him

\-him using me as his marriage counselor starting at when I was six years old

\-me screaming at him on the phone and hanging up feeling violated and disgusting

\-him calling me abusive when I was twenty two

\-me telling him I'd been (**TW**) sexually abused as a child and him becoming extremely invasive and trampling my boundaries over what i did or didn't want to talk about and when

I could go on and on. I also remember there was a period of a few years when I was 14 or 15 or so when I was worried I'd gotten (**TW**) pregnant by him? It was really bizarre and obviously my sex education was lacking, as... He's definitely never ever touched me, but I always felt like his wife. And he used to lay in bed with me when I was too old for that to be appropriate, but I felt special when he did so I thought it was a good thing. People used to think was his girlfriend and did for many, many years.

I'm trying so hard to move on from my dysfunctional relationship with him, but I keep losing time and having bad days where I can't function, and since I'm around him all the time he keeps doing things that send me spiralling. I need to be able to function so I can get out of this mess I've gotten myself into but even before this last year I was barely getting by, so I don't know. I'm feeling hopeless and I don't want to feel that way because I want to have faith that I can get out and stop contributing to how bad this is. I feel like just because I'm living here I'm making him be abusive, if that makes sense. I would never apply that logic to anyone else, but to me... I don't know, it's probably an incorrect thought. It's actually a very bad thought. It hurts me.

Advice is welcome. Experiences from those who went through emotional/covert incest is also welcome. Things came to yet another head with him today and I feel more out of control than ever. He said I needed help and that I'm childish and immature and stupid and wierd. Same shit. He doesn't know I've been to therapy before, thank Christ. I really don't want him to know that. I can't wait to get insurance again so I can finally talk about the hell of this last year and a half with a professional.

I remember mentioning to an irl friend that he'd called me abusive. It was a year after my mother had died and he was raging at me a lot and I'd scream at him and freak out. My friend said that a lot of abusers will call others abusive, is this true?

684,kuntorcunt,1613765322," 

I'm on a journey of healing from childhood trauma and C-ptsd from Narc parents.

I was recently struggling with unemployment and financial issues, after having to stop university because of my mental health (dealing with confidence issues, anxiety, depression, addictions and ADHD). This situation forced me to move back home (a small city, with very few school and job opportunities) after living on my own for 5 years, to take time off to focus on myself. This was the only choice I had, and while financially it helps, mentally this environment is so toxic and negative and I wish I could leave.

Ndad passed away 4 years ago so now it's just Nmom and my brother. I am in my early twenties and my nMom is sick and ageing, in her late 60s. I've wanted to go NC but without my immediate family, I don't have anyone else in my life and have no support system, and if she passes too, I will officially be alone, having to fend for myself.

I know and have met some members of my extended family, but we don't have a relationship at all, because Nparents have tumultuous relationships with everyone. My whole childhood has been in isolation, I remember every holiday just spent with my brother and my parents. So I guess I am estranged from my extended family.

While I have been able to make some friends in university, my unhealthy attachment style, trust issues and mental illness makes it difficult to build real long-term relationships. I keep pushing people at a distance, so my friendships are friendly/fun but superficial. But we are not close enough so I can't really rely on them if I need a place to stay, life adive/guidance or need help financially, etc.

I'm getting better mentally as I'm trying my best to ""re-parent"" and love myself, but the lack of support from the few people I know is very debilitating. I've started to see a new therapist and hope therapy will help but in the end, I know that they won't care for me as a parent would and they're are just doing their job, and this makes me feel despair. No one at the moment cares about me deeply, and no one is looking out for me. I'm just ""no one"", I could disappear and no one would even care or notice.

I want to move back to the US (in live in France), maybe to California and go back to school but I don't even know how I could afford to do that. I have so many goals and aspirations (be a musician, open an art center...) but have so many setbacks. I feel extremely limited in what I am able to consider with my future, as money seems to be a constant hindrance in nearly every aspect of my life.

How do I build myself up and create a new life for myself in a new city without financial help from anyone ? How can I figure out any sort of life direction while being so young, inexperienced and mentally ill ?

How do people start out in life without any support ?

I ""think"" i have been physically abused as a kid, but here hitting your kids with a belt, wire, clothes hanger or even spit in their face...etc is more like a cultural thing, and very common way to discipline your kid, so everyone makes me feel like I am ungrateful for my parents, for complaining about this, after I grew up,

And I just don't know who's right anymore

I have very few friends, my father is very strict, I am not allowed to go to gatherings or parties or a friends house, so I am used to be lonely, I don't feel like I wanna go to a party or visit a friend's house anymore, i was sad about this growing up but now I just got used to being lonely and idk if that's ok, actually being around people makes me anxious, cuz I am not used to it and therefore I do/say things that are out of the social norms, and I end up embarrassing myself, 🤦🏻‍♀️

I honestly feel more comfortable alone, I don't enjoy being around people, but I get anxious thinking that I will end up lonely and disabled when I get older, I understand that marriage and having kids doesn't protect you from being a lonely grandmother, because your kids might not want you in their life when they grow up, and I have seen this a lot, cuz I work in the hospital and I have encountered many people bringing their really old parents trying to get them admitted for no medical reason, I have seen a doctor signing a DNR (do not resuscitate) order on his mother,

So I know for real that having kids/partner doesn't mean you will die happy,

Anyways, I am not pretty at all, the only guy who was interested in me was a 40+ years old married dude with fucking pitch yellow teeth who brought his 2 daughters to the ER and was hitting on me in front of the nurse in the clinic 🤦🏻‍♀️
Maybe he was just being friendly, idk

I am a morbidly obese woman too, so I know I am on the un sexy end of the spectrum by default, been a morbidly obese kid, and now a morbidly obese woman with mental problems

My boss at work, is decent, not pretty, he has a fair skin and a fair/semi black hair, pink lips, black eyes, and somehow I found him attractive, he is definitely the crazy type, and he is super funny when he is mad, I found him so so cute, he is like 10 years older than me and married with a newborn baby girl 👶, 

I don't know why I have feelings for him, a lot of times I play dumb to piss him off regarding work, cuz he ignored me on many occasions, like he doesn't take me seriously at all, I often feel brushed off whenever I talk to him saying an opinion I got,

I once touched his finger tips accidentally, and he was mad cuz I touched him 😡😡😡😡

My design for the piece involves a cast of two hands being pulled together around the wrists &amp; upper forearm by fishing line. In between these two hands’ palms will be a bundle of fish hooks and sharp metal/objects piercing the skin. The fishing line will be wrapped and tied into the fish hooks and around the hands so that it gives the effect of the hands being locked together by force from the lining and fish hooks pull.

691,008Luna,1613764617,"!!TW: Emotional and physical abuse, suicide 

I was often threatened by my dad to be embarrassed in front of others if I misbehaved in public. He even did it sometimes and I think I'm alone with this kind of trauma. 

If I was late to school my dad threatened to come into class dressed as a clown and embarrass me. Whenever I was just a minute late I would spend the school day scared and shaking.

(He never did that but I was terrified)

When I cried or was upset in the supermarket my dad would make super loud weird noises until everyone looked at us and I begged him to stop and promised I would behave.

He would sometimes steal things too, to scare me and make me go quiet so we won't be cought. 




...I want to write down the worst thing he did to me in public here, I need to tell someone, I feel like vomiting when I think about it and just writing trauma down calms me. 

(The story will probably sound disturbing so please don't read if violence and being publicly embarrassed triggers you!)

So: 

I was 12 or 13 years old and my dad wanted me to visit my aunt with him. 

I HATED that aunt. 

She was basically just my absive dad as a woman, even worse.
She had more kids and treated them all like shit.

I didn't wanna come along but I was dragged in the car. My dad always thought it was important to take me to her, because they would talk about how I misbehaved and exchanged tips how to ""discipline"" me.

(I'm the black sheep of the family because I developed mental illness and they see me as weak and retarded)

When we arrived at my aunts place I refused to get out of the car.
My dad yelled first and then dragged me out by my arm. I started walking with him but then he pushed my head (its a common thing that he did when I was walking too slow and he was pissed)

I freaked out and decided to fight back for once. I pushed and hit him and wanted to run away but he grabbed me by my hair and basically lifted me up by my hair. 

He carried me by my hair until we were at my aunts house. I remember screaming and kicking him and it was one of the worst pains I ever felt. 

In front of my aunts house stood a bunch of teenage boys. Maybe 3-4 boys with their bikes. My dad threw me on the ground next to the boys and said something like: ""Look what a stupid, disappointing daughter I have""

The boys stared at me silently and drove away. I looked around for a way to just instantly kill myself and ran to the road but my dad dragged me inside to my aunt.

I had to listen to them talking about my ""disgusting behaviour"" in front of my cousins for hours. 




I just had to get this out. I had a panic attack writing this.

692,Quakeslave,1613764340,"So this is my first post on reddit... ever. I'm worried of just rambling and such, but therapy isn't financially an option for me in my area, and I genuinely connect with some of the stories shared on here, so I'm hoping you guys will understand mine.

Before I divulge my past trauma, I want to give a bit of context in the present, and why I'm struggling so hard. Within the past half a year, I left my job as a travelling CNA because of compassion fatigue. It was causing me very much stress and guilt, and I fell into a pretty deep depression.  Around the same time, I was seeing a therapist on the BetterHelp platform, who advised me to take an antidepressant. An unfortunate side effect of this antidepressant caused some issues in the bedroom with my partner, which has never been an issue in the past. I was hoping with time that side effect would go away, but after a couple of months it seemed to only get worse. It's also noteworthy that I struggle with an alcohol addiction, and is still an issue today.

The issues in the bedroom caused a rift between us, and I switched antidepressants hoping that it would get better. I switched to a different drug, and kind of simultaneously as I did that I began to feel immense and intense guilt towards my dog, whom I've had for around 5 months now. Because of my depression, I barely had energy enough to get out of bed to start my day, so I knew I wasn't putting enough time towards him. I would go to work, come home, make myself drinks, and play video games until I was so drunk I passed out. rinse and repeat most days. My drinking makes me feel like I'm following the same footsteps as my father, and I'm terrified of that.

About a month ago, I suddenly broke down in front of my girlfriend about my dog for the first time in 6 years. It was ugly and snotnosed crying, but it was so *HEALING.* It was a cry I needed so, so badly because I held it in for so long. 

Since then, i've broken down in front of her a few more times, and because of this subreddit I realize now its because certain thoughts are triggers for these emotional flashbacks. The fact that I'm not alone  The problem is that my GF also suffers with anxiety and depression. When she sees me break down sometimes it causes her to have panic attacks. Her first boyfriend killed himself when she was 15, and was then blamed for it by her peers in school. The last relationship she was in before me was a mentally abusive one, only about a year before we started dating. Her grandma died only a couple months ago. 

We're two people who have been through so much hurt and pain, but have felt real love, warmth, and intimacy for what feels like the first time. I don't want to lose that love. I love the way she smells, and the way it feels when she rubs my beard with my head in her lap. I love the freckles on her face, her smile, the feeling of her in my arms, and of being held in hers. She inspires me to want to be better. To be the man she deserves and can be proud of. I'm trying to crawl out of my depression and take better care of myself.

My question, and the reason I bothered to type all this out is this: How can I explain to her that the reason I suddenly change from happy, smiling, and cheerful to suddenly bawling my eyes out is because of trauma? It's like memories from my childhood are coming back to haunt me That listening to my dog whine when I put him in the kennel to go to work reminds me of being put in a corner for hours, sometimes while being screamed at... and makes me feel like that scared little kid again? Or hugging my knees to my chest, sobbing silently. Knowing that the banging upstairs means that my drunk father is going to come down and beat me. Mercilessly, until he's had his fill. Having this be a few times a week routine.

Or of the mental abuse? Of being forced to sit down next to him for hours, Unable to leave in fear of his wrath, as he tells us (my brother and sister) how our mother is a whore. If we dared disagree, he'd force us into submission, repeating himself over and over again with anger in his voice until resistance was futile.  Of being huddled together on the couch downstairs listening to our parents scream at each other all night. The only comfort is that we were crying together instead of alone.

I haven't thought about these things in six years. I'm 24. I've lived most my young adult life desperately trying to get past the trauma and isolation I've felt for what feels like so long. It feels daunting to know that I opened this Pandora's box, and how far yet I still have to go. How do I explain these feelings to the most beautiful woman I love the most? My rock who's been steadfast beside me throughout the happiest of times and my lowest depressions.

I've been struggling with my mental health immesely for 6 years and I just understood why. I need to recover from some traumas in my past and there is this one of my traumas that makes video recording or recording in general be a trigger for me. 

In 7th grade, I felt really insecure because I was ""too sensitive"" and I didn't like how I looked. Due to this, I was always in the school counselor's office for support. One day, I went to the middle school counselor and the counselor asked if she can have my phone so she can help me with confidence. Although confused, I said ""sure"". I talked to the middle school counselor about my insecurities and was being honest with her. She was holding up my phone and my phone camera was facing me as I was talking to her and she was laughing nonstop. I stopped talking about my insecurities for a second and asked what she was doing. She at first said nothing and I then asked if she was recording. She then gave me my phone back and saw some videos and photos of me on my phone that she took without my consent. I then felt violated, humiliated and powerless. But there's more.

She then said that I had every right to feel insecure about myself because what I felt about myself wasn't true. She said I wasn't pretty enough, good enough, no one will ever like me for the way I was and that I'm a joke to everyone. I remember feeling agitated right after she did and said that to me. I don't remember what happened after that because I was that shocked and traumatized.

I'm 19 and video recordings are still triggers to me to this day. My parents did record some of my mental episodes to get me some professional help in the past but they didn't know that this happened to me until recently and they feel awful that this happened to me. Meanwhile, it just fucking hurts every time I'm being recorded because of this traumatic event. All of this makes me so fucking angry.

So to cut a long story short, I was sexually abused by my “stepdad” from the age of 13 to nearly 18- he also constantly made threats to kill me and my mum and was abusive to her for as long as I can remember (I was about 2/3 when they got together)

In the present- I’ve been getting gradually worse and worse mentally and the whole of this week I’ve been the lowest I’ve ever been. Constant flashbacks, nightmares all night about it, physically can’t get out of bed, suicidal ideation, shaking etc etc etc- I’m sure you all understand the sort of stuff i mean. 

Anyways it’s been made harder by the fact that I literally have no one to talk to about it. My mum isn’t interested/doesn’t understand how bad I am, my dad is very sweet but has said he doesn’t want to hear any details because it’d upset him, I have a sister but she’s been through something similar so I don’t want to trigger her/make her feel any worse/be a burden for her. 

I have literally no friends I can talk to any more because I’ve pushed them all away. I have one close friend who does care but I’m too scared to tell him because I’m scared he’ll think I’m crazy or just doesn’t want to know- I don’t want to unload onto him and freak him out.

I tried counseling but my counselor was awful and I felt much much worse after. I just don’t know what to do and I feel utterly alone. 
If anyone has any advice I’d be really grateful, but I’m also very grateful for the chance to just be able to vent like I did.

And I know some people will need meds their whole lives and I’m not going to dispute that, but I’d still hope they’d be working on healing regardless of if they plan to stop meds, if they have trauma. 

The amount of damaging BS that is normalized is disgusting. This stuff is a cycle and not enough people are remotely aware, because when you acknowledge trauma people get uncomfortable. Abusers get mad, they manipulate and gaslight us into thinking we’re the problem. Like we’re weak. We’re (okay now talking about us meaning the readers) silenced and many people just shut up and continue the cycle. No. We go through the painful process of becoming aware and then healing in order to break a cycle that has been repeating for centuries. We are among some of the smartest and kindest people. Those bat shit crazy people you hear about in history class? They knew how they were being treated was wrong. They were the sane ones. Not the abusers. Not the people who locked them up. 

And then people think their pain has to be validated by one specific thing. I’ve had a man tell me he’s not traumatized because there’s not one singular thing in his childhood that he can say is what started it all. In the same breath he says his first memory is of his drunken father bashing his and his brothers heads together. 

Like is that not enough? He obviously had ongoing abuse after that. Regardless - you’re telling me that’s not enough? You’re telling me you don’t feel disconnected to that moment? I  don’t think healing is acknowledging that things hurt, they may still hurt. The healing is acknowledging that and dealing with the hurt in healthy ways. 

It pains me to see my niece carry the weight of her bipolar mother. “She (niece) would feel bad if she couldn’t comfort me.” Shes fucking 7. SEVEN. Your feelings are not your children’s responsibilities. And I have to sit back and watch this bullshit because it’s frowned upon to intervene. I’m watching my nieces brain develop in such unhealthy circumstances. Her mother is out of control and really unwilling to get help. I pray she does not end up that way.

It pains me to see my best friend who grew up in a household full of mentally ill, manipulative, selfish and abusive people, always being neglected because she was quiet, didn’t want to cause issues - continue to stuff down her emotions, isolate herself, and then have a child because she feels her life is over and that child will give her purpose. She has a shit ton of unexplained pains and has since she was a teenager. You can’t convince me she doesn’t have unresolved trauma. 

It pains me to know that I spent so long depressed, suicidal, going so far as to act on it because not one person in my life could recognize that my environment was unhealthy and nobody bothered to tell me that there is a life outside of my toxic environment. I was just depressed, lazy. And you know what? Even if someone could see what I was exposed to wasn’t okay - they also couldn’t intervene because what I just explained with my niece. 

We fucking isolate people who are in the process of being traumatized because of our own inability, our lack of healing. Yes we need to put ourselves first but adults have had the opportunity to heal, but don’t, and decide to raise children in the same unhealthy environments they did and then have the audacity to blame the child for feeling anything negative because “you went through it too.” 

Everyone deserves more. If abusers had had the resources and compassion to give them an opportunity to heal, shit wouldn’t be so bad. Maybe less of us would be on this subreddit.

710,throwitoutsonnie,1613751662,"My mind will NOT accept that it was wrong for my mother to physically abuse me. It was bog standard physical abuse, without room for subjectivity. I intellectually know that it is not ok to hit children (that it's illegal where I am), yet when I think of myself being hit when I was 7, a bunch of weird stuff automatically happens in my head that I'm barely/not conscious of or able to control. Parts of my mind reject that we were abused.

I also have a type of dissociative identity disorder and I have an introject so I think it's the introject doing stuff in a separate stream of consciousness that I'm not allowed to know about. An introject is an implantation of the abuser's abusive personality in the victim's head that torments them long after they've escaped. Basically it doesn't allow my whole entire mind to accept that I specifically was physically abused. It will not ""land"" no matter which way I try to address it with myself. The closest I can get to actually accepting that I was physically abused is through displacement stories but even then it will not go in and stay there. The acceptance of the abuse gets kicked back out immediately.

Displacement story: Basically I ask myself, ""If I found out that \[my parent friend x\] was hitting their child in 2001 like that, would I have called CPS?"" The answer is yes, but it still won't quite land for me. Child abuse doesn't apply to 7 year old me for some reason. That's the closest I can get though.

I work with vulnerable populations now and of course if I suspect someone is being verbally abused, emotionally abused, sexually abused or physically abused, either in combination or any of them on their own, I take care of business with gusto. Yet if I imagine my adult self encountering my mother and my child self and finding out that abuse was happening, I imagine that I wouldn't say anything because it's nbd, even though I have multiple psychiatric disorders now so it was a big deal to me and that should count. What happened to little me would be a big deal to anyone- adult or child. It's like the introject thinks I deserved to die and be grateful for it and it won't let me see myself as physically abused.

It's insane and I wish I could take a pill that would make every part of my mind accept that it was wrong for me to be hit and that I should have been saved.

For whatever reason, my mother seems to require that I spend the night at her house (with only one bed) for her to feel fulfilled in our relationship. As a kid, she often came to me for affection and closeness as she never remarried after my parents divorce. Between wanting to focus on me and thinking that physical intimacy between unmarried people is a sin, it seemed like I was the only one who could meet her need to have that closeness. 

My husband and I have been together for a number of years and we live about 2 hours away. I acknowledge that spending the night at her house would make things easier logistically, but it makes me feel weird. Her request was specifically to come for a visit when my husband is working (and can’t join for the trip). 

It just sucks that I feel so weird about it when I feel like *actually* it’d be pretty normal to say “hey! If you want to share a bed with someone go find that person. It’s not me!” Other parents don’t require that their grown children come for overnight visits and share a bed. I don’t know, I’m just getting frustrated that she has been ambivalent about romantic relationships while expecting me to pick up the slack.

718,Aneriz,1613745470,"I remember telling my best friend in 4th grade that I didn't have school bullies, I had a bully waiting for me at home. 
I look back at those 20 years and I did feel imprisonment, I felt tortured. 
Her psychological manipulation since I was an uneducated 4 yr old, making sure I said I had an accident if a teacher ever found marks on me. 
Then as I was a preteen her telling me if I told authorities then I'd never see my sisters again. I did threaten to call police on her before when I was like 10 or something. 
She's choked and punched me in a closet when I was 8. Often slammed my face against counters, pulled my hair, punch my shoulder for not cleaning right single digit ages and all. 
Nearly everyday she was humiliating me before school. Shouting at me near daily. Like she was angry chef ramsey shouting at me daily ""you stupid donkey!"" 
Bad enough for me that just seeing something like Hell's kitchen as a 14 yr old I'd get shaky and dizzy, feeling like I'm losing my breathe watching to me of what happens to me but in 3rd person now. The dizzying terror that it never ends. That's how life is. 

School wasn't any relief for me, I was the most quiet shy kid in every class I had, it's like I didn't exist, I realized now that I was afraid of all people, there wasn't a person I wasn't afraid of. Because of my award shyness no one liked me, no one befriended me. I was lucky to make a couple best friends at schools that would last me several years. From my shyness people would give me hateful disapproving looks and it strongly further cemented my fear around all people. My art teacher from elementary became a warped view for me, a living goddess walking around, she noticed my artwork and that was it for me I was starstruck just from that. She doesn't know she became this heavenly figure in my dreams. A grand mythology of my past. 

Somehow I out of nowhere trusted a partner, prior to my partner I just didn't let relationships happen, whom came out of the closet and isn't attracted to me, anyway, partner saw signs of my mom being not normal, and when I was with partner in person I had psychological triggers, it was like I was worse away from my mom, like instead of knowing my main torment and danger was my mom, the fear began to spread irrationally. My partner saw me get weirder and weirder, asked me what was going on 
And without ability to control myself I lost myself an increasing fearful wail turning into a scream ""she hurt me everyday."" Shakiness, wailing screams, crying. Visuals and the sensation of having been in prisoned for 20 years. 
I was dizzy, limbs going numb, repetitive pattern of glitchiness that I didn't notice till partner would hold down to make it stop. 
That's how I knew that how I grew up with my mom was what it was. I grew up touting that I was happy, that I didn't know sadness, that I wasn't abused it was normal and whatever angry mom lol. 
My partner had a concerned look commenting that my mom messed up real bad. I was loopy for hours, glitching movement, walking around the place at strange pace pretending partner wasn't there, partner almost actually wasn't there, I was dizzy and things looked underwater. Partner I guess was following me around to make sure I didn't get worse? And partner didn't let me hide in a closet. I am just remembering now that that's what happened, I wandered off without explaining and went to hide in a different closet, I was feeling more despair that I was followed and yanked out of the closet. Spent a long time trying to walk off to another closet and couldn't see partner. Partner got me out of that by asking if I'd join walking the dogs and it did get me out of it. The dogs wagging their tails to the sound of leashes.  I calmed and explained that after long tormenting Chef Ramsay but with physical abuse also hours of abuse I always went to a closet. That I identified myself with the darkness of the closet and wasn't a person, that I was the darkness of the closet, dead, not there. I said I would stay in closet until I was a new dead being from the closet. And oddly I can't recall a day I've looked in the mirror and recognized myself. And when I see artwork I made in the past I can't believe I made those, it's like I'm seeing a stranger made those. 

Near 6 years away and I can't sleep right at night, plenty night terrors, waking up scared during sleep, several times. 

I think now the thing that affected me much about that abuse is it really really did feel like prison. I felt at prison at home and I felt that prison vibe follow me at school. The way my mom could torture me from sun up till sun day on her off day from work, on weekends to get me to clean the house, to hit me over missing a spot when cleaning some corner under the bathroom door from downstairs cause she found dust there. The torment of wanting to escape, run away, so many corners in a house, so many things I couldn't clean right, exhausted shaky from relentless shouting. Mentally tired. Physically tired from the hours of fear. 
Actually having spinal damage from her abuse, her smashing me around enough it was age 8 I guess why she choked me. Age 8 is when I developed what partner helped figure out for me that I had cervicogenic headaches. 
The thing was I really tried cleaning better and faster but past two hours of cleaning I'd develop a pulsating headache so painful it felt like I was pulling my brains out with just the movement of my arm. My mom thought I was lazy and making it up and hit me more, yelled more. 
Panting in pain. 
I remember the pain would go away by sitting absolutely still for 30 minutes or longer, sometimes I was blessed with the misfortune of it lasting 3 days. Some days I'd wake up with it much worse cause I slept at a bent strange position on pillow. 

Partner saw me in person with those headaches I remember telling partner ""I don't know what these headaches are cause I googled it and I only find out about migraines and mine doesn't sound like migraines maybe it's a brain tumor idk?""
My partner seeing me stiff and crippled by it. Telling my partner I knew better than to be active for more than 2 hours. Some mornings ofcourse waking up with neck pain and that dreaded pulsation increasing when I'd move. Me pressing pinching my face, my neck, pinching my neck to reduce the pain. Staying super still waiting for it to go away. 
My partner having a very concerned look for me and one day went more tenacious to try find out what it was. 
This same headache I told doctors about for years and they brushed off as nothing. 
We spent a longer time trying to find out my headache. Looking around. Tenacious. We finally found a matching condition. I remember reading the page slowly losing my smile. ""If severe it requires surgery"". 
Unsure about my life with this condition I read ""cervicogenic headaches can go away by sitting still""
Something like that. 
Just reading the surgery part. I was there frozen. An expression of loss. 
Reading about how spinal injuries cause these headaches. 
Looking at my partner ""I thought I was just some freak never to be believed and had some rare headache no one else in the world had"" 
Re reading over and over ""if severe requires surgery"". 
Memories rolling in me of grabbing cleaning tools panting in pain, with deeply painful head throbs at every movement, feeling seering pain, cleaning slowly, figuring out ways to appear more productive when she comes by like keeping main body still while forearm moves fast without shaking main body.
It wasn't everyday that these cervicogenic headaches occured, it happened often enough it was another part of miserly experience there. 

My mom was just as abusive on my cervicogenic headache days on non cervicogenic headache days. 
And for days I slept at the right angle or whatever prevents them happening for the day, the days I was all productive ahead of time going beyond my usual. My mom would just ignore all I did. And still yell at me for new dishes that weren't mine that recently got on to sink. Yell at me so many hateful and threatening things. 

Its like I was born into a prison, into slavery. But people saw me at school, I looked fine on the outside, I was breathing and sitting still. Because I looked fine on the outside and people think I look fine on the outside I'm okay. To them.

I stood up for myself for the first time since I was 12 years old.

This is a small victory, but it's a big step for me. I think.

So, last night my friend raised her hand against me. Like she was going to hit me. As a joke. She just meant it as a joke. In hindsight, I realize it was part of the conversation. She's a bit physical when she tells stories. But because of what I've been through, and how my family raised me, I couldn't see it that way. I actually thought she was going to hurt me.

She had no way of knowing what kind of effect that would have on me. Absolutely no way of knowing. But it scared me so much, I couldn't move, I could only speak. When she asked me what was wrong, I asked her if she was going to hit me. She wasn't. Instead she held me. She held me tight.

At the end of the night, I asked her not to raise her hand to me again and she agreed. It took me a few minutes to get the words out, but when I finally did, she didn't argue. She just agreed. Just like that. I almost cried there. Out of fear or pride or relief, I don't know for sure.

When I was a teen, my parents divorced and my mum had a new partner; he was very plain about not liking children and not wanting a family. He lived a couple of hours away so my mum would split, visiting him and being with us, leaving me and my sibling with out abusive father.
Whenever we visited my mum and her new man, I remember he tried his best to make us feel unwelcome. Make us do ""chores"" and even basic decency was always framed as a special favor. Like having a place to sit while watching movies that is not the floor. It seems stupid, but not being allowed space really stuck with me. At one point he locked me and my sibling in the car, drove out to some place so he could shout at us, being angry about something completely inconsequential.

They have cats and I remember one day holding one of the cats and realizing how envious I was of them; at least they where cared for, and had a place to be. It felt like they where part of the family; I wasn't.

Last year my mum accused me of trying to split her and her man; and of ""being said that I don't have a home"" and then I asked myself 'why is that such a bad thing' and went no contact.",CPTSD,I was envious of the cats,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lnecn8/i_was_envious_of_the_cats/,1613707648.0
726,Snowy-Pines,1613736354,"A few years ago I decided to try therapy to help improve my relationship with my parents. I found a therapist I liked, but in the midst of navigating the nuances of my relationship I realized that exploring the emotional abuse I had experienced at my parent’s hands would basically make me dissociate(not surprising).

My parents had changed and improved as people over time. My relationship as a result has also improved from where it was, but our engagement was still awkward. While in therapy I was fine exploring my emotions in an a more objective way and using that to help change my old perceptions/approach with them, but as soon as I started to bring up the impact and emotional experiences of the trauma, things went a different direction. My ability to stay present, not feel emotionally overwhelmed(shut down), and communicate kind of went out the window. Even though the situation was very different now, my mental and physical response was as though nothing had changed.

Obviously this will need to be worked through, but how can I even begin to tackle this mess if there is such an emotional block when just talking about it? I almost feel like CBT might not be the most effective approach here. Is there a certain type of therapy approach that I should look for when searching for a therapist.

729,ukprivate,1613732268,"*heavy sigh* so I've been thinking about this for a while now. Usually this type of sadness overcomes me whenever I get the extreme urge to live my maladaptive daydreaming and again realize that welp, that's never gonna happen.

It just saddens me so, so much that I'm wasted potential. Being such a talented person with so much potential, my dreams have been ripped away from me with ""seemingly"" no one else to blame. When people look over my life, they hold me accountable and responsible for where I am, not my damned circumstances and trauma which has ripped me apart. Trauma that has stolen giggles and joy from me. Trauma that wounded and damaged my inner child. Trauma that has snatched away even the desire to live from me.

Whenever I'm in this stage, I think about what could've become of me if I hadn't gone through so much bullshit. The sheer talent I possess could implement itself, I wouldn't have to voraciously live through other people, I could connect with the world in some shape or form. I could have a sense of belonging. I could succeed and truly live for myself.

I'm so tired of pushing myself to work or go out there in the world and literally having no idea what to do at some point or the other. I'm even done with ""hope"" because it just never works out, it never will. At this point, I'm also tired of being done with life.

All of the leadership qualities I possess. Every fucking time I'm reminded that I'm surrounded by people who don't even possess half of my talent, skill set, work ethic or abilities because they prove it with their work, but they ""succeed"" more than me because I'm fucking stuck. Bound. And that's how it'll always be because I can't fight for so much. I just can't. I'm angry. I feel betrayed. I feel bitter. I feel alone. My abusers didn't just take away my present from me, they took away hope from me. They ripped away my abilities from me.

And precisely this is why, I'll never fucking forgive my abusers. I will never, ever forgive those monsters for doing this. Never. They could rot, they could weep but it still wouldn't remove all of their wrongdoings. And one (probably only) thing I can't wait for? Is when they start to pay for their actions. God knows that probably that'll be one of the times I feel true ecstasy.

He's a physics teacher, and he's actually never gotten angry or yelled at anyone in class, or anything like that! 
Sure, it's a difficult subject which may have be a bit stressed, but I'm mainly anxious *about* him, which I know is super irrational considering my situation.

It's just his mannerisms that remind me of a person who put me through a lot and who was very very unstable. But actually, his mannerisms aren't even that close. It's just a similar vibe, but it's enough that I'm extremely on edge the whole class, emotionally it feels like he'll snap at any time just because my brain is likening him to the that past person. 
I jump at the slightest sound, or get dizzy and space out at times, and I just wish I could disappear. I feel a knot in my stomach before every class and I perform worse than I should be able to.

I think I may partly associate the classroom and the class with anxiousness and fear because during our first class we dropped heavy metal objects that made a loud thud sound repeatedly, for some calculations. I jumped super high and my head snapped to the sound Every. Single. Time. 
And there were ~8 groups dropping that heavy object repeatedly, meaning not a minute without several of those sounds. It felt really embarrassing because I know my lab partner noticed. He tried to joke it off, but I was too dizzy and my heart was beating too fast so I couldn't joke back well. My brain just started thinking back to old traumatic memories and it was awful.

 I had online classes for a while and they went great! I could even ask questions! But now I'm doing distance from home while most of class is in school, which means I see him in the class setting, and I find myself being all anxious and too stressed to focus again. It feels so stupid but I even unconsciously lean back and curl up whenever he's closer on the screen. I wasn't even ever physically hurt during my trauma, though I was afraid I would be several times.

I feel so so guilty that I feel like this, he doesn't deserve it. He's my class's favorite teacher but meanwhile I just feel afraid and want to hide. Does anyone know what could help?? It's too vague of a similarity that I would feel so stupid if I tried to tell someone. I do have a therapist I speak with but I'm not sure if I'd sound like an attention seeker and overdramatic if I brought it up.
Sorry this is so long, I would really appreciate any advice or comment whatsoever. I'm kinda nervous about posting here but I hope it's alright? If it's not I'll remove it right away!

Last night I had a dream... Honestly there's too much to really remember or even note here, but I unfortunately recall one part quite vividly... 

It was in first person view (sometimes my dreams are in third person, not sure if anyone else has that, but given the content of this the first person aspect makes it that much more uncomfortable), I'm pretty sure my mother was on top of me, choking me or holding me down, not sure which, maybe both, saying all sorts of horrific shit about me and about my dad, while she raped me. 

What's concerning is this felt very real, and in the past year or so I've been uncovering memories of some other shit my mother has done to me, and I'm actually worried that this might have been more than a dream... I'm genuinely terrified that this was an actual memory... And I'm not really sure what to do about it. I didn't really have time to bring it up with my counselor today, but even if I did I'm not sure I would have been able to since I have trouble talking about this sort of thing without freezing up. 

I haven't really been around my parents outside of a couple times I went over to grab some stuff I had forgotten, and I only really talk to my dad on messenger and even that's pretty rare. I'm not sure what else would have prompted this sort of thing in my dreams, especially since it's like the third or fourth time this year I've had a dream where I'm being sexually assaulted... 

But this is the first time it wasn't some random faceless person/people. My mother has done some borderline shit to me that I'm aware of, mainly involving bathing and such when I was a fair bit older than it would be reasonable for a parent to do so. (At least I feel it was) but she was also really close with someone that got arrested for sexually assaulting his kids for years, and my mother is kind of just overall an awful person, so I'm not really convinced she wouldn't be capable of doing anything to me or any of the other children she's watched throughout the years...",CPTSD,More disturbing nightmares...,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lnchwq/more_disturbing_nightmares/,1613700787.0

741,jade_rockford,1613724874,"I know I didn't handle this situation well, but I'm hoping to get an objective viewpoint on whether I should trust my instincts or if I should attempt to rectify it. 

For around the last 6 months I've been trying hard to make friends. I met a girl on Bumble BFF and we hit it off right away. But something she said in our first meeting -- that she had only been swiping on people who ""weren't that attractive"" -- bothered me, although I brushed it off at first. I have some pretty severe issues around my looks, and my self-esteem in this area is quite low, and frankly I think there is almost zero situation where someone's looks need to be pointed out to anyone. But, I didn't want to write someone off for a single comment. 

A few months later she went back to visit her home country, then told me she wasn't coming back. I have been pretty emotionally volatile in the last couple of months after sustaining a pretty bad concussion in an accident, and also there's a global shortage of a medication that I take for mood stabilization. Not that I'm trying to make excuses, but I've had a very rough go of it for the last few months. I decided that if I wasn't going to see her again, I'd tell her that I didn't think what she said was appropriate, and that I didn't think people's looks ever needed to be pointed out, and that in the future she should probably just keep those judgements to herself. I told her this over text message since we only text, which was probably a poor decision, and maybe I shouldn't have said it at all. But frankly I don't regret saying it, because it was a rude thing she said. 

She responded and didn't exactly apologize for what she said, but explained that she meant that she wasn't looking for friends who wear a lot of makeup (which seems like a weird excuse because if you have some weird hangup about makeup, just say you don't like people who wear a lot of makeup, which would frankly also be a weird reason to judge someone but makeup ≠ attractiveness). She also said she was sorry she hadn't ""made a comfortable space"" for me to bring this up to her at the time, which isn't exactly an apology for saying the thing she said. Then she said she was upset about what I said because she has body dysmorphia. 

Somehow I ended up apologizing profusely to her, as well as explaining why I have trouble bringing things like this up to people on the spot because in the past when I've tried to assert myself people have immediately cut me out. Then I asked if we could talk briefly on the phone to discuss it, and she said she wasn't in ""the right headspace to process"" my apology and asked if we could talk about it when she comes back to where I live (which I don't even know if she actually is going to do or not). I told her that of course we could wait to talk about it, but a few days ago I blocked and deleted her number (more than a month after the initial conversation) because I really don't care if I ever see her again. 

I don't see why her having body dysmorphia would give her license to basically call other people ugly, and I feel pretty gross about the fact that I was the one who apologized to \*her\* profusely when she never actually apologized to me for what she said. And because I revealed to her that I was afraid of people cutting me out for standing up for myself, and then she basically did just that. 

I know I should have handled it better, and that a text wasn't the correct medium for this conversation. I'm worried that blocking her number is a very immature thing to do and that I should unblock her and see this through should she ever decide to contact me again. But I also don't like that I'm now basically waiting for her to contact me again if/when she has processed my apology, and I have this deep down suspicion that if she ever does get in touch somehow it will be all about how much I hurt her by telling her why the thing she said hurt my feelings. 

I know this is long (yet boring!) but I have no one else to ask about this and I still struggle to trust my instincts in these sorts of situations because I never fully know if I'm feeling guilty and apologizing because I truly did something wrong or because apologizing for my existence is my default mode.

758,jellybean590,1613712340,"I really need to get something off my chest and you guys have always been super supportive so I hope I can leave this here. 

Background:
I’m recently pregnant (in first trimester) and have been an absolute miserable lump trying to do my best for my 18 month old while dealing with extreme mind numbing fatigue, constant nausea, and vomiting 3-5 times a day. Some days I can’t even hold down water, so it has not been fun. 

This has obviously lead to some tension between my husband and I. My husband, I suspect, also has some form of CTPSD although he’s been diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 37 and has not been on his medication as it causes him debilitating back pain (like can’t get out of bed on his own) and so has been waiting to get an appointment with a psychiatrist to reevaluate. So he’s prone to impulsive and erratic emotional outbursts, constant distraction, etc etc, and obviously this has been getting to me for him to be so physically (back pain) and mentally incapable at a time I really need extra hands helping especially to provide a somewhat stable life for my daughter. 

Other than that, I’ve been really self motivated about my own healing and learning deeply about childhood traumas and CTPSD, working through processing my anger and frustrations, and trying to reach some level of futility and forgiveness. I’ve been learning and going through what happens in childhood and how development stops and how it affects the ADHD and CPTSD brain. This is especially so I can be a good parent to my daughter. I realise I can’t without embarking on this journey. 

Recently, due to everything going on, husband and I have been fighting and arguing a lot more. And one of the things he says while we fight is how useless all my reading and learning has been because I’m not understanding of his condition or I can’t give him empathy and compassion when he’s ignoring us and being distracted and entirely scattered. and leaving me to deal with way more than I can handle in my own state. 

When I was young, my mom always criticised my shortcomings. When I loved singing, she’d tell me I’d never be a singer because I can’t sing on key, and that’s because I inherited my dad’s vocal chords and he’s an awful singer. When I loved painting, my mom constantly threw anger fits when I was focused on painting, telling me I’m using the paints wrong or not holding the paintbrush right and saying I’d never be a painter with such awful form. When I loved piano, she’d put me in competitions and when I couldn’t win anything, she’d punish me by withholding food and forced me to practice piano all weekend by punishing me for my failures. 


 Thing I need help with:
And so, my recent fights with my husband, with him shaming me for my reading and attempts to self heal (I had already been in years of therapy and felt good about putting that on pause to do some self searching), it felt like all that criticism came crashing down again and I feel like I’ve entirely lost my intrinsic motivation to learn and heal. I feel like I’ve become that little girl again with the overly critical mother, except this time it’s my husband shaming me and telling me something I loved doing was useless. He told me he hates me because I’m a hypocrite. I know this is due to his own trauma. His mom is a qanon-homeopathic-antivax narcissist who insists all his shortcomings were his own fault by nature and that she had always been a perfect mother. So the hatred and hypocrite comment is also loaded with emotional baggage and is not entirely true on me. 

Another part of me feels like I can’t continue this journey with him around. He will always drag me back, we obviously bonded in some unhealthy codependent way, and since becoming a mother myself, he’s behaved less respectfully towards me and I know that’s because of the baggage he carries towards his own mother. 

I just...I guess I’m just seeking emotional support. I feel lost, I feel shame, I feel small and vulnerable. I feel like I’ve yet again lost something I loved for myself.

763,pokeballdweller,1613709305,"Sorry if I am doing this wrong, I am new to the thread. 

I am 24F and I honestly have no clue what to do with my life. 

I am trying to keep this short so people will respond but just as a little backstory: 

I lived in England for the last 14 years. I was sexually abused, amongst other things growing but and have had multiple traumas. I had about 6 different schools, and the assumption is usually that I was a part of an military family, but really my mom just liked to bounce around or, we would burn bridges and be forced to move. 

I settled into a school in year 9, my Dad lost my passport when I was visiting so I missed most of the year. 

Then year 10, I started out well I was getting As and Bs in most everything but math. Math I struggled with because they refused to move me to the higher ""tier"" class and I was in the slowest paced classes- I was SO BORED. 

Anyways year 11 rolls around and I am getting close to my final exams... my teachers had a meeting and decided, despite me getting As in all 3 sciences (biology chemistry and physics) because of my math grade- I ""couldn't be good at physics"" and would be dropping to just biology and chemistry on the ""foundation level"" where I could only get a C grade max... Oh, and Math I would be on foundation level too. 

My mom fought it because they just sprung it on me and I had study plans/tutoring for math where I was catching up from the stuff I missed because I couldn't focus in class. The school dropped it when she said she would report them to Ofstead. 

I was trying but it... the spark was gone I felt like everyone in school was against me and wouldn't listen. So I stopped studying or trying as hard. I pulled a ligament in my back and missed the last 4 months of school lessons before I graduated. I passed all of my classes but I ended up getting Bs in science and Cs in math and english. 

I moved schools in A levels and still struggled because it felt like all teachers cared about was my ""performance"" not the fact I was in counseling, had a hard time at home, it didn't matter if my mom and step father kept me up till 3 am, I was supposed to turn up and be ""a good student"". 

Well I flunked the first year of a levels. I went back after deciding to try again..  and... oh boy. This was good. 

I went back and I again, struggled in classes. My head master pulled me in for a lecture aka him getting to yell at all the underperforming students. 

I enter he starts saying that I am not doing well and how it's not tolerated and I can go to X school if I want to ""goof off"". 

Well I try to take it on the chin, I say I am really sorry. I am having some home problems, and I will try to do better... 

He. LOST. IT. 

He says ""you know what, I don't think you were abused. I think you like playing the victim, the martyr, and only do it for attention. All you are is a talented actress. You wont be here by the end of the year""

I left in tears, ran out of school and flunked out shortly after. My chemistry teacher actually was in the room during the meeting and I didn't know it at the time but he called my mom to tell her how inappropriate my headmaster had been and how upset he was with the situation. 

But yeah. I didn't do well in school, some of it is my fault, I take responsibility for the fact I shouldn't have  let it bother me so much and just kept my head in the game. After all it just effected me in the end. 

I have had various jobs since then and I just cant seem to stick with it for a long time. I have a problem with authority- not in a rebellious way but in a I will run away and quit if I think that the situation isnt going well- even if I am getting praised. 

I just dont know what to do I wish that I had gotten a university degree but it feels too late, and then on top of it I don't feel attracted to anything.

764,BheanGorm,1613708783,"My husband is the sufferer. I have been with him for 5 years. I am running out of things to say when he vents to me. 

I have always been under the impression that when someone vents, they want one of two things. 

One: Help with the situation

Two: Simply to be heard

But lately neither of these sees to be working for me. If I offer to help, it becomes ""I can't vent without you trying to fix everything."" If I just listen and sympathize, I'm basically no help and I ""don't care.""

There are a lot of mental health issues that my husband has grappled with for many years. He has severe depression and anger management problems. These days fewer and fewer positive things come out of his mouth... and I am wearing thin. I can't keep up with all the negativity but I have been so very emotionally available for him...until I wasn't. I ran out of things to say and it makes him upset.

So every weekend I choose between isolation and emotional risk.

So everything started going downhill when I was 6, when a friend coerced me into s*xual acts for quite some time, her mom even watching once before stopping it. She became my first bully, and tormented me for years and years. When I joined gymnastics, we were forced to work out until we were sick, I was constantly humiliated in public, and taken to the side where I was told I was a waste of time. I also had a coach that was arrested or r*pe, and other coaches that made all of us feel uncomfortable. The head coach treated me so badly that the team began to do this as well, expect some went to my school, so I was constantly bullied. My dad is sick, mentally and physically, so he can’t work. Both my mom and I work two jobs. My dad gets aggressive, even going as far go threaten to beat my mom or to choke her. I’ve had to barricade myself into my room and threaten to call the cops. I have nightmares where he kills me. He sometimes throw things at us and will constantly call her (sometimes me) and idiot and insult her. He gaslights us all of the time. He uses OUR money to hold over our heads. But I feel as though I can’t be angry at him because of his health issues, especially because I had to save his life 3 years ago. The doctors said if I didn’t do what I had, he would have died. I don’t want to be angry or have feelings about it because I never know if it will be the last thing I say to him. I developed @norex!a, and almost died from it, along with diagnosed depression, anxiety, an CPTSD. My therapist always wants to call CPS but we both agreed it wouldn’t do much. I wanted to talk about this today because it is the anniversary of when my eating disorder landed me in the hospital. But today I am 3 years hospital free.

767,Midnighttonigght,1613707702,"So my husband bought me the package for Valentine’s Day it came with a Hedgehog plush, a card that says “someone loves you”, a rose, and a hedgehog sticker. Our hedgehog recently passed a few weeks ago so this made me extremely happy! It feels like he’s still with us. 

This doesn’t seem like a lot but growing up I always wanted specific toys or teddy bears and my mom always said no. My dad was the only one that bought me plushes but they’ve been lost in the many many times I’ve moved. My dad also moved out when I was 4 so I only saw him on the weekends, and he had two jobs for the majority of my “childhood”.

I feel the excitement from when I was younger and I got a new toy on my birthday or Christmas. Other than that I didn’t get many toys or love. My bipolar narcissist mother mentally and physically abused me practically every day until she kicked me out at 16. I also was sexually abused many times and have a whole lot of other things that have happened to me. 

I say I didn’t have a childhood because I cared for myself, I was home alone every day after school. I was forced to start doing all the house chores at 5 and start cooking at 6. I couldn’t go outside unless I was at my grandma's on the weekends, I practically raised my brother and took care of him every day. 

Then after I got kicked out my life got much harder. I’ve had to work full time since I was 17, and saved up enough money to get an apartment with my husband. Now I’m a year away from getting my bachelor's and I have my car. My life is much better since then but she completely uprooted everything, I hadn’t planned to move out until after college. I still feel like I can’t enjoy my life as a college student because I work so much. I’ve always had to be the “mature or Independent one”. 

I put the card in the kitchen so every-time I walk in there I see it and try to convince myself that someone loves me. Both of my parents rarely told me they loved me growing up and even to do this day. I always think that everyone hates me and is out to get me. 

I’ve been cuddling my plush all day and sleeping with him, it helps with the loneliness. When I have the means I plan on buying more stuffed animals and comfy pillows. I’m 21 and feel like I made my inner child happy. 

I saw someone else buy themselves a toy and it seemed great. I’ve been searching for this digital Barbie-like toy where you could live the day as a Barbie and play. When I asked my mom for it she said it was dumb and bought me clothes instead for my birthday. Because it’s a few days before school she would always say my gift was back to school shopping.

I just thought I'd say that after 20 years of trying to smoothe over my personality and interests, and genuinely thinking that I'm bothering people by talking for more than 5 seconds, some friends got through to me. I think I actually might believe that people might like me for me.

Somehow I've ended up able to spend quite a bit of time with my oldest friend over the last few months (on Discord, but hey), and I actually feel like someone gets me, and I'm ""enough"". I had to stop talking for 30 seconds mid-conversation because it hit me and I was trying not to cry.

I still need a mouth-guard for stress-grinding. I still pick at myself inside and out. I still dry-sob when I think about eating ""bad"" food. I still don't know what to do about my family, and I don't know how I'll find someone needy or patient enough to date me.

But something actually went right. Unemployment fading into social reclusion, a new job I hate, my first date in years turning into a nightmare rolling directly into a breakup at the start of covid and more isolation.

I keep convincing myself to live by for example liking a girl and then not wanting to miss my shot. But I never take my shot so I can keep living. Small stuff like that keeps my life going I guess.

I didn’t start masturbating until maybe 24. Literally. My abusive ex used to make fun of me for it. I just never really grew into it and I don’t know why. Could be sexual abuse, parents, Catholic Church, a combination thereof.

778,Prtmchallabtcats,1613701620,"I just remembered a desperate moment in my early childhood. I'll have been between three or four, based on the sibling who came from this.

I've been thinking that I'd figured out the final parts of my trauma when someone posted on here about infants and attachment, and a commenter described trying to break out of their crib. I almost commented this there, but realised that would have been far too much. I've been oversharing too.

I was locked in my room and given half of a bread roll with margarine on it. I remember that because i hated the taste of margarine. Then the day started passing by and I had listned to my christmas themed cassette tape several times over. I don't think it was winter.

I drew a sandwich and a glas of water on some paper and slid it under my door but of course no one came to look at it. In the end I figured out how to lift the lock of the four. The lock that was on the outside of my door. Screwed in for no other purpose than to lock me up? Why the fuck did my cold little bedroom have a lock on the outside??

It was a very old farmhouse, my parents had their room near the living room, and i was in the opposite end of the house, past a long, dark, cold hallway, through where the rotten bathroom and the attic were, with the old front door leading into the kitchen and living room. I was so scared of that hallway, because my dad told me ghost stories and was very intent on making me see them, to the point of drugging me.

The only heating was a wood burning stove in the living room, several walls and empty rooms from my room. Why was I locked in there??

I found my parents naked on the couch, and was told that my dad was simply lending my mom his penis, because as I could clearly see, she had it at the time (between her legs). Stunned at that and already terrified of the beating I expected for breaking out, I was then heart broken to have my plea for food ignored and be marched back to my room and locked in. I never broke out again even though I didn't get beat.

I know the taste of grass intimately, what it feels like to chew it when you're so hungry that it's actually pleasant until it gets stuck in your throat and you sit there under the trees and wonder if your short life will end with you choking to death alone and still being too scared of calling for help. Because needing things hurt in the very real sense of physical punishment.

I was conceived immediately after the death of their first, premature child. I was born almost three months premature and barely lived. My parents were, to put it kindly, lost souls, who agreed to breed for different insane reasons. There was no love, I was always meant to be the first of exactly two wonder children because my dad was super intelligent and pretty. He was also super damaged, and between the two of them they managed to fuck up every aspect of their little project while leaving three children alone in the wake of it all.

The only reason my soul didn't just die during my early years was the cat. She was a farm cat, left to fend for herself in all weather, having litter after litter of kittens that were usually taken by the fox. And if they weren't it was worse, so much worse. She cared for me, and I think of her as my mother. I don't like to admit that, because it feels so silly and sad, but maybe I'll stop being ashamed of it. Of her.

***TW: Emotional, Physical, and sexual assault and abuse, death threats, threats, and rape***

(I already posted this a bit ago but got no responses so I'm doing it again)

The first trauma that’s given me PTSD was when I angered this man and he got really mad at me and threatened me, saying he was gonna kill me and describing the ways he would. He grabbed my arms and shook me half to death, but thankfully another dude saw and helped me. Because of how harshly he shook me I passed out for a few seconds too. This still affects me and I feel absolutely stupid for it. It happened a few years ago, and I just feel like it “wasn’t bad enough” since it’s not like he punched me or stabbed me.

The other trauma is from when I had a friend. At first she seemed nice, she’d give me gifts and compliments a lot. The person that she was friends with, that I also befriended, was always quiet or hurt in some way. At some point she was able to tell me that she was actually abusive, and at first I wasn’t sure if I’d believe her, but then she started begging me to not talk to her anymore. So I decided to confront her about it. And she just completely changed. She went from happy and bubbly to angry and almost psychotic. I guess she thought there was no point in hiding it anymore since she started insulting and gaslighting and hitting her right in front of me. I tried to stop her but then she turned on me. That’s when she started abusing me. She’d hit me and beat me up, chocked me until I passed out or almost passed out several times, and took advantage of my ptsd from the earlier mentioned event and triggered me constantly. She said that she was the only one who’s ever care about me and that I was lucky that she didn’t kill me right there and rid the world of such a burden. But she didn’t, since she wanted my death to be slow and painful according to her. We weren’t allowed to do anything without her permission. We couldn’t talk, or eat, or use the bathroom and stuff or she’d hit us or something. She used it to humiliate us. And since we weren’t eating well, especially me, she enjoyed taking our food and eating it in front of us or not letting us eat and making us look at it. Then she’d throw it away. She’d tell us stories of her earlier victims, and we’d have to praise her or she’d hurt us. She also touched and raped me several times and purposely made it hurtful because she wanted me in as much pain as possible. Sometimes when I did something she deemed wrong, or just exist in general, she’d beat her up and make me watch. Anything I did could make it worse, like if I protested or looked away. The whole time she’d blame me, telling me that I made her do it and that I was a terrible person. Sometimes she did her “punishments” and when I’d ask her why she’d say that me existing was enough of a reason because I was such a terrible person. Because of nightmares every night from the incident with the man, I was barely sleeping, so I’d doze off during the day. She took advantage of it and anytime I did she’d trigger me or hit me and then anytime I started dozing off or just fall asleep I’d freak out cuz I connected sleep = pain even more. I tried to tell the other people in my camp, but she made them think that I was the abusive/mean one, so they never believed me and blamed me. When I tried to tell them about the raping they’d think that I was lying cuz a girl couldn’t rape another girl, and that I wanted it since I orgasmed, and if they did believe me they’d say I finally got what I deserved and praised her for it. I tried to tell the counselors but they’d bring us out together so she’d just make me lie then punish me afterwards. I’m surprised they never heard us scream, or saw us cry or the bruises. The only reason the other girl hid hers at the camp was so no one mentioned it and she got it trouble with her for it, since her parents didn’t even care whether she lived or died and she had to take care of herself and they never asked. The girl was also like 2 or 3 years older than us and stronger than us so we were never able to fight back, and she lowered our self esteems enough that most of the time we didn’t cuz we felt like we deserved it. Another thing she did was take advantage of my paranoia that he’d come back (he said that he would and nothing would stop him), saying stuff like “You’re sure he can’t find you?” Or “he might know where you live, cuz ya know the internet’s crazy now.” And stuff.

This only went on for like 3 months so I feel like I’m just invading with actually abuse survivors, since there’s other being with their abusers for like 3 years, or even a decade and stuff. And I feel like I deserved it since I never really fought back, or cuz I was stupid enough to believe her in the beginning when she said I was dreaming it up, or in the very beginning when I thought she was a nice person. My partner says that it wasn’t my fault and I didn’t deserve it, but I don’t feel that way, so I was hoping to get other opinions on it. I feel really pathetic and overdramatic to not be over it, since it's been a few years. Thanks for reading this whole post if you did!

1. Sleep has improved
1. Hypervigilance has gone way down

1. Depression is pretty much gone

More importantly, it doesn't interfere with other meds I take because it doesn't affect serotonin or dopamine receptors. This is huge for me as I cannot use any of the usual cast of hallucinogenic substances.

I joined the military at age 18 to escape the insanity after failing at college, my dad cried and I wanted to join the Marines. Nine years later, I was discharged from the usaf, with many physical and psychological issues. I was awarded 100% pt from the VA because I didn't hold back, and told the examiner exactly what happened, why I joined, and how my father robbed me when I returned home through a bullshit business he opened.

795,BoysenberryParty8534,1613692435,"I just got a new roommate about a month ago. To be honest, I was already skeptical of the situation before she got here, but we've been friends for awhile and figured I could trust her enough to give living together a try. 

The problems started prior to her moving in, with my sister leaving behind a lot of stuff to deal with that should've been taken care of already (cleaning, packing, etc.), but ended up landing in my lap to handle instead. So I started out this new living situation already feeling guilty about things I didn't know were problems until it was too late and they delayed the process.

Then my roommate actually started moving in and it was up to me to figure out where to put everything she'd brought for our shared spaces. Boxes and boxes of stuff to unpack, no help, but it was framed as me ""getting"" to pick where everything goes. She has not washed dishes or cleaned in the communal areas at all since being here, and I have convinced myself that I have no right to ask and am too afraid of confrontation to bring it up (hooray for fawning). She's told me if I have issues to let her know, but surely on some level she must be aware things in that department have been lopsided, right? 

There's also been a problem with money. When the first month's rent came due, she was surprised and short the cash. Apparently, her last place was due at the end of the month, no beginning, so when I said it was due February, she basically took that to mean March. I hate saying this, but I almost don't believe her - which is probably just me being used to my mom habitually lying to save her own ass. Either way, I ended up covering her share of the rent in addition to mine because I didn't want it to blow back on me, too, and had the means to do so. I've been avoiding the topic since and I'm worried I played it cool to the point of giving the impression I don't expect to be paid back. Granted, I'm okay enough financially without it, but it's not what I signed up for. It also feels like my fault in a way for not being clearer about the due date? And it almost feels petty to say anything because she's been catching up with bills since getting back to town. 

I haven't really been able to say anything to anyone because I don't want people to hold things against her (a lot of my social circle overlaps with hers) and every time someone asks how it's been living together, I bite my tongue and say it's been great. To be fair, some parts have been. All of this is just making me wish I would've lived alone after all, though.

I have this unsettled/anxious feeling that I don't quite understand. I think it might be what people refer to as feeling ""empty"", but I'm not completely sure. 

It's kinda like I have this void I need to fill, almost constantly. In the past I've used drugs, alcohol, tattoos, piercings, random road trips, literally anything that's a bit on the spontaneous and crazy side really.

It's almost like there's some kind of wall between me and these things that I can't break through to get myself to do them and at the same time I have a strong compulsion to do something crazy.

798,blartyplart,1613691687,"So, it turns out that this whole trauma thing really sucks. God, I look back on my childhood and I can't even count all the fucked up shit my parents did to me. From my dad beating the shit out of me over random infractions to my mom coming in afterwards and hugging me while telling me that it was all my fault and that I brought it upon myself, it just went on and on. 

Fun fact, I'm actually autistic. Well, I haven't been diagnosed by a psychologist, because my parents refused to ever take me to one, but my therapist agrees, and even though they will never admit it, so do my parents. Because I just don't get the rules behind the ways people work, and it was really bad when I was a kid, so I remember half the stuff my dad used to beat me for were social failures. My mom used to react to my childhood stims by condescendingly saying ""are we being autistic today? That's what autistic kids do, are you autistic? No? No, we're not autistic.""

So yeah, I recently had to accept that, in spite of the fact that my parents tried to beat it out of me, I'm almost certainly autistic. And that's okay. And just because they'd always point out other autistic kids and tell me how annoying and weird they were, and how I ""didn't want to be like that,"" being different isn't wrong. Got it. Great. Fun.

So why the hell do I keep running back to them? And why the hell do I keep feeling like crap about myself for being different? It doesn't help that I'm also a trans woman, and that's unacceptable apparently, so I'm kept at arms-length from the rest of the family, kept the big, embarrassing secret that nobody can ever know, and yet, I'm still so desperate to please them. I'm still constantly calling my mom, pretending to care about what she has to say, acting all friendly and loyal, masking all my impulses, stims, and neurodivergent behaviors, all so she can pretend she has a happy, ""normal"" Christian son. When I haven't been any of those things for my entire life.

I'm so desperate for love. I'm so desperate for affection, for someone to look at me like their daughter. I never got to be anybody's daughter. I feel like an orphan, because they don't even act like my parents anymore. I haven't heard from my dad in eight months. My mom is always audibly bored listening to me. And when things aren't overtly awful, my brain latches onto those moments and uses them as proof that I wasn't abused, that my parents still love me, and that one day they'll accept me as their daughter. But it's been well over two years since the found out. It's not going to happen. And even if it did, it would never undo the other trauma they put me through. My dad can't un-beat me. Even if he wanted to, he just can't. Anytime my girlfriend raises her hand to reach something that's even remotely near my head, I flinch. And if she goes to caress my cheek, I close my eyes and wait for the blow to come, even though I know that she'd never ever ever lift a finger against me. My dad can't erase that. He did this to me, and he should be ashamed of himself. And yet, all I want is for him to pick me up and let me ride on his shoulders again, just like I used to do when I was small.

I want my mom to hold me again. I want to feel safe in her arms again. I want her to tuck me in at night and sing to me and pray over me while I go to sleep. But I'm not even their child anymore. They only love me on principle, not in practice. They ""love me"" because it's what they're supposed to do. They never wanted me as I was. They never wanted a ""broken"" child, so they went and broke me further. Because I had to be ""fixed."" And now, I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. I'm so desperate for motherly love that I keep googling ""how to find new parents,"" as if people post ads for that kind of shit. God I LIVE for ""found-family"" stories these days.

I am able to meditate for about ten to fifteen minutes at a time. I understand that meditation is about being calm and trying to keep thoughts away and to focus on your breathing. After about two minutes of meditating I have no thoughts. I am no longer able to imagine my body, the room, anything. What happens is that within my head things start to flash, usually black to white. If it is not the flashing, it is like looking at a rapidly spinning sphere that is covered in pictures and scenes. But the sphere is moving too fast to be able to focus or recognize any of the pictures. I just get a feeling that it is not good. I try to pull away from the spinning sphere of gloom, but I cannot pull my thoughts to anything else. After a few minutes of this it will dissolve and my meditation will be over. 

Sometimes, watching the sphere of doom leaves me with an overwhelming sense of fear or that I am being pushed down upon. There is a heaviness, a weight. The emotions I am left with have reminded me of my childhood and some of those unfortunate experiences. It is those memories and through work with my therapist that I recognized that I dissociate as an adult and that I learned to dissociate as a child. I continue to meditate, to face the darkness, and to remind myself that I am safe. I want to learn to control the dissociation and if it happens, I want to recognize it happening.

805,steffejr,1613689349,"The backstory is that when I was a kid my father used a belt for punishing me. A nice wide, worn in leather belt. The worst part was not being hit with the belt, those bruises heal. The worst part was the fact that he would hang the belt from the light fixture in the center of the room. This was a reminder of what happened or what was to come. It was that part, the memory of that belt hanging there, that has stuck with me for all these long years. The summer after high school, when my father moved away and I went off to university, I bought myself a big, wide, black leather belt and made a pledge to myself. I pledged I would never take the belt off in anger. I would never beat my kids with a belt. It has been 28 years and I wore that belt nearly every single day. I never took it off in anger and after being a father for 14 years now, I never used it to beat my kids. 

I feel like I graduated. I am finally accepting that I am not my father. I will never be him. I am me. I have taken off that belt, that reminder, and have cut it in two pieces. I will burn it during my next summer camping trip. And I bought myself a new belt. A beautiful belt hand painted with colorful neurons to reflect me and my passion in life (I am a neuroscientist).

814,Britbrat77,1613685724,"My mother was verbally abusive and neglectful. She also was occasionally violent. When I was a child my mother dated several abusive men. Most of the men she had relationships with would move into the home sometimes with their children from previous relationships. All the men were physically and sexually abusive. My mother never tried to protect me growing up and often blamed me for my abuse. She would even expect me to protect her from them even when I was very young. 

Three years ago (when I was 22) my mother was murdered by one of her boyfriends. She was in a semi-commited relationship with two different abusive men that knew about each other and who had other girlfriends as well. She lived about half the time with each boyfriend separately. The two men did not get along. I unfortunately hung around both men separately, so I was constantly dragged into their drama (this was not the first time my mother had been in this situation). 

One of her boyfriends beat her to death, oddly after I found out the two men had been secretly talking. Then, the murder investigation was extremely messed up. I am still waiting for the court date, but the prosecutor claims that Covid is slowing things up at DAs office (IDK). I am my mothers next of kin since she was not married. All of the CPS reports became hot subject with detectives early on in the investigation. I learned things that I never knew about. My mom was getting reported by doctors for abuse back when I was in preschool. She was reported by every pediatrician that I was seen by. Sadly, all of this is just the tip of the iceberg that came out with her death. 

Even though it’s been years and I now have a baby of my own, I still have nightmares about what that man did to her. I miss my mom and wish she was still alive. I know she wasn’t a good mom but I still wish I could show her my baby. It sucks that her life ended like this. 

What am I supposed to say to my children who will never meet her? I don’t believe in lying but the truth is beyond horrific. The only thing I can think to do is for my husband and I to hide the truth of my family until my children are grown. I don’t see my family often and the ones I do see will respect my wishes. With today’s technology let alone decadeds from now, it won’t be hard for my teen/adult child to find limited information on their grandma’s murder let alone all the rest of the skeletons (I can find quite a bit with a google search of close relatives).  

How do fully break the chain? My husband and I are not like my troubled family members. We have been together for almost a decade and have a good marriage.

It's not as if my requirements are requirements of perfection.  They are requirements of *core* qualities primarily centering around conscientiousness, respect, and vulnerable honesty.  Which is more like an authenticity.

The sad reality I'm coming to is that these core attributes are very rare.  That has to be the explanation.  Sadly, a lot of people are just not honest with themselves and others.  Or they pivot on a lot of coping techniques, which is a kind of dishonesty.  I've opened myself up many times to giving people space, to not get too distracted by easy indicators that they don't have these core attributes, but every time I find they don't.  It's sad, too, because these people may have many great attributes ...and because of my disposition it becomes a kind of judgment process, which feels unloving or something.  But I know that's not true either, considering how much care I put into trying to see their frame and point of view, to not hurt them, etc.

817,cedricreeves,1613684605,"This  workshop focuses on repairing early attachment conditioning through  a  series of guided meditations along with relevant psycho-education.  It’s  aimed at people who are looking to improve their psychological  health,  especially those who have tried other healing modalities with   disappointing results.

Cost: Sliding scale down to $1 so no one is turned away due to lack of resources.

First thing to note is that Dan Brown and Other view CPTSD as having it's origins in disorganized early attachment conditioning.  He discusses it here on the Therapists Uncensored Podcast:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHJXSBKYEaw&amp;t=212s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHJXSBKYEaw&amp;t=212s)

What to Expect:

In this workshop we’ll take a both wisdom and heart approach to healing.

For  the wisdom part we’ll do an investigative meditation practice  looking  at our fix habit patterns, our “Schema Modes”. Our modes are  like parts  in other psychological systems like IFS. We will investigate  the  origins of our parts/modes in aversive childhood experiences and   develop understanding and compassion for our modes. We will see how   these aspects of our selves are blameless and simply just impersonal   responses to difficult situations. “Any other person would have   responded the same way as me.”

Moreover,  we’ll learn to be more aware of our parts/modes as they  arise. We’ll  sensitize ourselves such to “catch them’, instead of ‘them  catching  us’. Furthermore, we’ll develop mastery over them by learning  how to  use alternative means of emotional self-regulation (the Ideal  Parent  Figure Protocol in particular). Here it’s important to understand  that  our parts/modes are just maladaptive/afflictive means of self   regulation. There are other means to stay emotionally self-regulated if   we just learn the healthy techniques.

The  guided mode meditation draws from Schema Therapy “modes work”.  Jeffrey  Young developed Schema Therapy in response to experiencing   disappointing results with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in   treating more deeply disturbed clients with the likes of borderline   personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Schema   Therapy is a well researched and validated psycho-therapeutic modality   effective for treating deep seated psychological disturbances.

For  the corrective emotional experience part (a heart practice) of  the  retreat, we will do Ideal Parent Figure Protocol (IPF) guided   meditation developed by Dan Brown to heal early attachment conditioning.   The Ideal Parent Figure Protocol’s primary object is to repattern the   Internal Working Model of Attachment from insecure attachment   (dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) to secure attachment.

Attachment conditioning lays the foundation for developmental lines of:

* interpersonal relationships: both romantic and platonic
* emotional self-regulation
* exploration and healthy self-development

If attachment isn’t secure then further development in these areas is often disturbed.

Insecure attachment is a causal factor for many grave psychological conditions:

**Dismissing Attachment**  is likely partially causal of:  Narcisistic Personality Disorder,  Obsessive Compulsive Personality  Disorder, Antisocial Personality  Disorder, Substance Abuse Disorder

**Preoccupied Attachment** is likely partially causal of: Histrionic Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder

**Disorganized Attachment**  is likely partially causal  of: Dissociative Identity Disorder,  Paranoid Personality Disorder, Mixed  Personality Disorder, and those  disorders listed above.

Moreover,  attachment disturbances can be causal to or exacerbate more  common  problems like depression, ADHD, and anxiety as well.

Retreat Overview

Guided  meditation will be the main focus of  the program. There will be ample  opportunity to ask questions and share  whatever you feel comfortable  with. There will be no pressure to do so.  Passive participation is  perfectly fine.

Retreat Structures: Psycho-Education and Guided MeditationsPsycho-Education

We  will start with a brief lecture on attachment theory, attachment   repair, Ideal Parent Figure Protocol (IPF), and then Schema Modes.

Guided Meditations

Guided  meditation will be the primary means for working through the  schemas.  We will be taking an attachment theory based re-parenting  approach in  the guided meditation. These meditations will give us **corrective emotional experiences**. These will help us remap the **‘internal working model of attachment’** from insecure to secure.

* **Ideal Parent Figure Protocol** (IPF). Here we have *imagined*   ideal parents re-parent us around our particular problematic   parts/modes in question. This gives us the corrective emotional   experience we need to heal at the root.
* **“Mentalizating the Modes” Meditation**.   Mentalization, also known as meta-cognition is the ability to reflect  on  your own and others’ mental states. This helps us understand the   motivations that drive behavior. Weak mentalization abilities are   correlated with poorer functioning in life, and psychological disorders   like personality disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, and  substance  abuse disorder. Strong mentalization is a hallmark of robust  mental  health. Understanding your own and others mental states helps to  develop  confidence in making sense out of the world and your  experience of it.  **Particularly we’ll focus the mentalization meditation on the maladaptive modes (parts).** This move us towards integrating our parts/modes in to a healthy and more unified healthy self.
* **Tong Len**,  a Tibetan Buddhist compassion meditation.  This will help us cultivate  compassion generally and also particularly  around the schemas or  modes/parts in question. Moreover, by considering  how others suffer  with the same suffering we will see how we are not  alone in our  difficulties. This helps to normalize the painful  experience of the  schemas. Moreover, compassion around our shared  difficulties further  builds solidarity and a sense connection with  others.

Walking Meditation/Breaks/Journaling

Most  hours will consist of a 20 minute walking meditation session and  a 40  minute seated guided meditation session. The walking meditation   sessions will serve to help integrate the previous guided meditation   session. Brief walking meditation instruction will be offered.    Alternatively these 20 minute sessions can be used to journal or to just   take a break.  All three will help you integrate the previous guided   meditation session.

Miscellaneous

There will be a lot of time for Q&amp;A and spot coaching

We will be doing deep work on this retreat. For that reason please feel free to take a break at any point.

This  program is based on sliding-scale in  order to be accessible to anyone.  Please feel free to share with any  friends or family who you feel  might benefit.

Benefits

By the end of the day long retreat you will have:

Theoretical Understanding:

* More understanding of the modes/parts from a schema therapy perspective like:  

   * Demanding internalized parent voices
   * Overcompensation modes like “workaholic mode”, or “self-agrandiser mode”
   * Avoidance detached modes like the “detached self-soother” and the “spaced out fantasy mode”
   * Compliant surrender mode
   * Vulnerable child mode (which we reparent with the IPF)
   * Healthy Adult mode (which results out of the vulnerable child getting it’s needs met)
* A  basic understanding of attachment theory, know the importance of   attachment repair and how to start doing it with the Ideal Parent Figure   Protocol.
* The  importance of your personal explorations as a source for meaning  in  your life and more clarity on how to proceed in life towards those   explorations and goals.

Support Structure:

* A half day of attachment repair meditation that will start moving you towards a secure attachment conditioning.
* A very effective way to do emotional regulation on the spot in your daily life with ‘micro-hits’ of IPF
* A  sense of camaraderie as a result of seeing how our psychological   difficulties are rooted in common experiences that affect us all.

I got diagnosed with BDD+OCD at age 20 and spent 7 years in and out of therapy dealing with that.  i have done well... although my BDD has relapsed hard just lately and im suicidal everyday..

at age 27 i was diagnosed with avoidant PD and Cptsd. So that was a major blow as i thought i was nearly better. So now I have severe anxiety disorders, trauma and a cluster A personality disorder.

Now the more i reflect... am mindful and engage in therapy- it appears i was right for the last 10 years and i do indeed have NPD...  and sadism....  my therapist has now pretty much said i have NPD though she knows im too fragile and afraid of being like my father that she wont say it flat out.

I feel like im up against it.... too much. ive had a decade of therapy on and off. three years for cptsd and im still totally fucked up.  I feel I'll never get remotley better. For reference im low functioning. I've never had a relationship. i have one remaining friend... when people talk about having relationships while dealing with cptsd i think - wow... how is that even possible.

I got traumatised in my first year quite badly and then lived with a sadistic sociopath for the next 20years (my dad) and a histrionic traumatised mother.

so that leaves me here at 30years old and ready to die. i have been suicidal since i was 10 years old but now i have had enough.. so i dont know what to do. i don't think psychotherapy can help me... im too complicated and messed up. 
Im traumatized and anxious but then cruel and sadistic. im both sides of the coin. 

so..  i think in a year or so... im going to travel to Peru or Ecuador and partake in both an ayahusca ceremony and a san pedro 'huasca' experience (high dose.)

If that doesn't help me fix myself and become a better person ill probably end it.

-----

my one plan B that im keeping in mind is learning about compassion. and devoting myself to the alleviation of suffering in others.  somewhere like Africa or a war striken country...  but i keep asking myself; how good at helping would i be if im this twisted? would i do more harm than good?
And im so traumatised currently that i cant even feed myself so what good am i to anybody.

so plan b feels like a nice thought... not much more to me right now. id love to help like this but i think im properly broken. i think

The relationship I've been in for 6 years is going terribly wrong and I think I need to leave, even if I don't leave I really crave independence. 

I was raised in a cult and my parents never taught or prepared me to do anything other than get a man and do housework. 

I have a very good therapist but I've only been seeing her for a couple months. I'm planning on asking her for help as well, I know there are sometimes agencies that can help you get a job. But in the meantime I'd really like advice and to hear your experiences with this sort of thing. 

Any tips for being able to get/keep a job in this situation? Are there any specific jobs that are known to have an understanding environment or expose you to minimum triggers? If I am unable to do that, will I be able to get disability? Is getting disability acceptable? What is that process like, and what do you need to do to get there? 

Does anyone have resources for learning how to interact with landlords and do money stuff? 

Does anyone who struggles with flashbacks and dissociation drive? I love driving but I had to stop because it was really dangerous how much I'd zone out. it feels like a seizure sometimes. 

Does anyone cope with being romantically alone because relationships are just not a good idea for them? Is feeling fulfilled possible with no partner and a basic minimum wage job? How hard is it to find good friends? 

I'm so scared of becoming homeless. And being alone. But I already feel so incredibly alone in my relationship. I love him so much but he has shown that he doesn't respect me by lying to me, ignoring my boundaries, not taking my triggers or abuse of children in general seriously, and saying mean things when I try to open up to him. He is a huge troll on the internet, uses 4chan and hentai a lot, he looks at a lot of really questionable but not illegal things involving children (usually teens) in sexual context, and makes excuses for it. He is very good with technology and could be hiding something much worse, there's a lot of factors that make me feel like this is possible. He's always playing ""devils advocate"" on reddit about MY rights as a woman. He gets mad at me for being triggered by the creepy and sexist/ableist things his friends and family members say and do. He just doesn't listen to me or care when I tell him my experience, values, feelings. I don't know if he does it on purpose but after talking to him about those things I come out questioning my own reality. I have been massively psychologically abused in a past relationship before and it doesn't seem the same at all but it's having a similar effect. 

Right now it seems like everything would be pointless without love, but to be fair I'm so depressed that everything seems pointless anyway. We have a house together, huge garden plans, and a cat that I love so much and I don't think he is very good at taking care of, but I definitely couldn't take care of the cat in an apartment and on minimum wage or disability. He has a lot of money and I've gotten used to that, I'm dependent on caffeine, nicotine, and kratom so i will have to quit all of those because i can't afford them. I've been trying but it's extremely difficult. We have done so many fun and amazing things together, I was so happy before this started happening. I feel so bad thinking about leaving him alone in a huge house. He will probably find someone else but thinking about that really hurts me. He might already have someone else, I've recently seen some red flags of possible cheating.

 I'm in so much pain right now. I feel like I'm completely screwed either way, and that my only value in society and in this relationship is sex and the possibility of making babies.

830,or6-5693,1613680558,"""Babies manage prolonged attachment and nurturing disruptions through a process of disconnection, which in turn compromises several aspects of development:

 • Expressing need and want becomes too painful. 

• The ability to know what they need and want is impaired. 

• The ability to express what they need and want does not develop. 

• The capacity to take in and integrate experiences of caring and love is significantly compromised. 

• The ability to bond and feel connected to a trusted other becomes limited. 

• The ability to manage intense affect becomes dysregulated. The younger the baby is at the time of the attachment and nurturing disruptions, the more pervasive the impact and the resulting dysregulation. In particular, the capacity for pleasure becomes compromised. 

• Cognitions become distorted by attachment loss and deprivation. On a cognitive level, children try to make sense of their painful experience. Children who are deprived of having their basic needs met come to believe that there is something wrong with their needs. As adults they hold the belief that they are not deserving or entitled to express their needs or to experience the fulfillment of their needs. 

• In attempts to self-regulate, they become susceptible to eating disorders and addictions.""

831,smallfrythegoat,1613679104,"This happened 3 or 4 years ago, the summer following my freshman year. I had a steady boyfriend at the time and came down with a UTI, so I asked my mom to take me to a clinic. My mom sat in the room with me while we ran through the questions, and long story short, this is where she found out I was sexually active. The nurse didn't even blink before she ""diagnosed"" me with chlamydia. I said but both my boyfriend and I have been tested, my mom scoffed, and the nurse said something to the effect of ""He probably cheated on you."" The urine sample she took only went for a 5-minute UTI test, which came out negative, so after that she said she would send it to a lab to test for STD's, and in the meantime I got some pills for the chlamydia. 

My mom was berating me pretty much the whole time from when we left the house to when we picked up the meds at the pharmacy and finally got home. ""You f\*cking sl\*t! You wh\*re!! What were you thinking?!"" Just one constant stream of these insults. I remember getting the most horrible look from the pharmacist. I was just so humiliated, and I couldn't believe it, since I'd had a UTI before and could've sworn that the pain I was having then was exactly the same.

I went through with the ten days of pills, but about that weekend we got a call back from the pharmacy saying ""Good news! You don't have chlamydia. Now fuck off :)"" 

I didn't want to see another doctor after that first experience. A big part of me just wanted to take some AZO pills and hope for the best, but the pain had gotten worse and I was feeling it in my abdomen pretty much constantly. I finally begged mom to take me to an actual gyno and just braced for more abuse. Turns out I was right, it was a UTI. I got the medicine I needed and gradually got better after that, all with my mom in the background just constantly reminding me what a whore I was.

The cool part is how I found out later when I was doing my research that if I had waited a week I probably would've gone into septic shock, because that pain I had was a kidney infection.

In the past, he has opened up to me about some significant trauma in his life. It's pretty clear that his way of dealing with difficult emotions/situations is by drinking, impulse spending, watching tik told for hours and other things that will numb or cover up difficult feelings. He talks about how he has had to be strong for other people in the past, and how that seems to work for him to get through things. 

There are times I've tried to bring up the idea of getting help and dealing with trauma in a healthier way, but when I do this, he always responds coldly and seems to reject everything I'm saying no matter what. He's always the person encouraging others to deal with things in a healthy way, yet he can never seem to do that for himself. 

This breaks my heart. As someone who's had some degree of trauma in my life (it was probably nowhere near as severe as his), I want so badly for him to be free of it.

I kind of just felt it and sat up to roll up my sleeve and see how bad it was. My bf was like ""what did I get you?"" and I just said yeah and showed him. 

It didn't start bleeding immediately but then it started forming that bubble of blood coming out. Obviously, my bf was freaking out and rushing to get a bandaid and a tissue all while apologizing. He was clearly very sorry and I knew that so I just kept saying ""its okay you didn't mean to""

I guess someone's response to getting stabbed is anger, but I was more concerned that my boyfriend was stressed and feeling bad he caused it. So I just laughed and made jokes about it. He was really confused about how I was reacting to it. I guess it was kind of the same situation when a parent acts really calm when their child hurts themselves so the child doesn't freak out.

But a year later, a year of therapy, psychosocial support and meds, it doesn't get to me. My inner critic wanted to have a go at me, and I was sad for a minute, but then my self compassion kicked the critic's butt and took over.

It's ok to have failed. I've got a lot on my plate. I have four diagnoses (CPTSD, MDD, social anxiety and an ED) with a fifth one (ADHD) in the making. My meds make the ADHD symptoms more apparent. I couldn't properly focus. My social anxiety goes hand in hand with exam anxiety, and it was an oral exam so yeah, even harder on me. It was a lot of stuff to learn and the professor is very strict. She didn't like that it took me a while to answer some questions (blacking out). But it's fine.

I've done the best I could with what I've got on my plate. All the disorders, being locked up with my abusers, new psychiatrist and recent med change, my former boss stressing me out and harrassing me, talks with medical insurance and trying to find an internship  - I did what I could. I doubt anyone I know who doesn't have these issues could have done much better if they were in my shoes. Sometimes things just don't go my way. It's probably better that way anyway.

848,immaweebab,1613668833,"I made a post as while ago talking about loop ear buds. They should be 15-30$ and range from -20 decibels to -30.  I have the -30

I finally got some 2 weeks ago and can tell you they do help. My ears are always open and I feel like they are constantly listening through the walls to my neighbors. And I can’t turn it off due to my last neighbors triggering me and knowing that my apartment complex isn’t safe. But I am, so this is where it come in.

First off I can hear people outside my windows but with these in and I can’t hear the words. So I can get the gist of the tones. My neighbors are safe they are just loud.

But bottom neighbor is a #gamer and is the kind that will yell at the top of his lungs and bang walls and throw controllers. He lives alone and leaves everyone else alone, I don’t think he knows that we can hear him. It’s caused me at least 3 mini emotional flashbacks and 1 big one. Lots of lost sleep. Yes I can still hear the shouts but the edge of the noise is significantly reduced. I don’t have a big jump response to him anymore.

These also feel flush against the ear so I can sleep in them. It does come with the drawback that all earplugs have which is hearing your breathing and heart rate but I’ve gotten used to it. Wearing them now while working due to the rage gamer yelling and a dog barking and I’m not overstimulated!

I really like them because it limits my hearing to one room. I know I’m not in danger. My dangerous neighbors have moved and everyone else at the very least keep to themselves. It’s hard to tell the body that. Now I can listen to my music and not get interrupted with a casually screamed god dammit. Or my neighbors basically yelling while they smoke. I can work from home, make calls and not have my heart rate increase because I hear people in the parking lot.

But I can still hear it and will take them out to make sure no funny stuff is going on. 

I was also able to wear them in a bar environment (covid safe of course) and grocery shopping and it really cut down on the anxiety.

I’d recommend it. I still have to see long term effects but I can actually concentrate on work and have the bandwidth to deal with my other triggers. Instead of just shutting down and my productivity going with it.

I have just recently opened a whole new can of worms, to make a long story super short, I had a traumatic childhood and thought that's just it and I'm on the finish line of my therapy, ready to take on a normal life, but I've just recently realized that my time in a psychiatric assisted living unit in my teens was a whole other trauma that I have to deal with. I'm living with brand new flashbacks and triggers now.

So I think I need to hear some good things, how people with similar pasts and similar challenges have been able to build up good lifes for themselves. I don't see my future too clearly but am grateful for how far I've already gotten. I would really be glad to hear how you ended up in life too. I think that I need to hear that other people have been able to grow strong despite their pasts. Please just tell me what kind of life you're living right now and what things you're grateful for in your life now, if it's not too much to ask.

I can give a summary of mine first, I hope I don't sound braggy because that's not my intent and I don't have anything to brag with.

I'm 27 years old now and I graduated as a practical nurse last summer. I have a job I enjoy and have made some friends at work.

They too have to get up every morning and make something out of the day they are given. But they still find the energy and happiness to be like that.

Through this, I was also struggling with my sexuality.  My parents were beyond homophobic to the point of obsession.  Seriously, the only way to be more homophobic than they were was to actually go out and physically harm LGBT people.  I was terrified from puberty onward of them finding out about my secret.  

That terror was justified because what happened when they finally did later on in my twenties was one of the few things in my life that actually turned out worse than I imagined.  I tend to catastrophize and prepare myself for the absolute worst outcome in any given situation, so that's a bigger deal than it sounds.

My lack of friends had to do with a combination of being gay and coming across as clingy to other guys, purposely avoiding getting close to guys as to avoid appearing gay, and my parents' strict rules being so out of the norm for a teenager that the other teens wanted to stay as far away as they could.  I remember talking to a guy and getting along and then he went to give me a hug and I pushed him away.  He was like ""what's your problem, dude."" and all I could say was ""nothing"" in a stuttering voice.  In reality, I was terrified my parents would walk in seeing me hugging that guy.

I would say out of everything I went through, this in particular impacts me the most today.  I was in a constant state of loneliness and terror because of my sexuality from age 13 through 23 and then again from 26 until my early thirties when my parents succeeded in bullying me back into the closet and into doing conversion therapy.

And just as I was moving past that, the pandemic happens and knocks me back to square one.  And I'm now about to be 36.  As traumatic as my teen years were, my adult life to this point has pretty much just been an extension and I've never been fully able to move on.

As hard as this is to believe, it’s the first time I’ve realised that I tend to obsess over people who have left me for whatever reason (because something hasn’t worked out, or the relationship has ended naturally).

All the people I’ve let have a big influence of my life (and even those I haven’t given permission) are always mentally present in my life, their imagined judgements guiding my every move. 

Well, I’m not going to live like that anymore. I won’t let my past or the people in it define me. Even if I were to meet them now, they don’t know me anymore.

Does anyone else fear when you make a post where one is trying to explain a serious but nuanced or easily misunderstood issue from knowledge/experience (or say something to people at all for that matter) that someone might crop screenshots of what you said/edit out certain words or edit in others/use the format of the screenshot and your username to have you saying something else entirely/even just rage at you somewhere implying that you said something you didn't, but get so much traction lots of people believe it/trap you into doing something right in one context but wrong in another, etc?  


(e.g. something I've seen TERFs do - ""\[Trans person\] said men in bathrooms with little girls is OK!"" and then you go to see what horrible thing your fellow trans person was saying - and it was literally *nothing of the kind*, they made a post supporting gender neutral bathrooms and the allegation was just out of the usual TERF belief that gender-neutral bathrooms equate with CSA. I've also seen racists do stuff with something like throwing around the N word while having a white profile pic and confederate flags etc and posting in a way that seems like white racists WOULD post, and then when you do what you're supposed to as a white ally and tell them off for it, they change their profile pic to a BIPOC person and then accuse anyone telling them to knock it off of policing their identity and language and performative allyship)

877,HikerZe,1613647112,"After trying a few therapists in the past to improve my mental health I decided to focus more on my childhood rather than the now. Reason being than I felt I needed to tackle the root cause than the symptoms. Previously I never really thought I had a tough childhood. I was never abused and felt safe most of the time. That being said I definitely feel I was neglected and I can’t help but think that made it traumatic.  

In my early years I don’t remember getting any emotional support or comfort from my mother. My earliest memory is being alone and isolated at pre-school and I don’t know why. It is a strong memory and created a fear of others than is with my still today. Although through school I managed to make friends with ease my social anxiety went through the roof. At age 12 it got too much and I refused to go anymore. My mum was angry with me and thought the anxiety was ridiculous. I was scolded rather than listened to. The school and government authorities were of no help either. Up and till this point I was also raised as a Jehovah witness which alienated me from friends but I also stopped going to church at this stage also. 

All through the rest of childhood and adolescence I stayed at home at just watched tv. Nothing else. No internet. No shopping visits or days out. No events. No contact with everyone. No learning either as I was told that’s what school is for. I wasn’t allowed to have books. My mum went to work and I spent every single day stuck at home. This also meant no Dr or dentist appointments. This is what I think falls under medical neglect? My only option of social contact was school but I was too petrified to go. At one stage when we moved and I was at the age to sit the final exams I told her I would go but to my surprise I was told it was too late and she didn’t want to deal with the stress of it all. This absolutely destroyed me. I finally mustered up the courage to overcome my fears only to be shot down. 

Since then and despite some academic success later on I find myself in my 30’s, hardly worked, a couple of short relationships and believe it or not am still living at home with my mother.

880,dear_pixel_heart,1613639766,"Hi kind people in r/CPTSD,

Quick background before I go into what happened, and I'm sorry this is messy, I am not very good at communicating. I am currently on disability due to MMD, anxiety and complex PTSD. I've been living with my mum since Dec 2019, who helps to care for me because I struggle to. My father was living with us at the time, but last year, I moved out, and my mum did as well, because my father since childhood has been domestically abusive. I haven't spoken to him since moving out last year, which I have never done before. 

Fast forwarding to now. My mum is back in a relationship with him (they don't live together currently), I feel uncomfortable, and don't see or speak to him still. As one of my boundaries, he's not allowed at this property. Today I found out that he emailed my psychiatrist, which feels like a boundary violation, unless I'm overreacting, and at my appointment today, my psychiatrist told me about it. I was told that in the email  that he said he misses me and is grateful that I'm being cared for by the psychiatrist. However, he goes on to mention and talk about two triggering things: 1, if only I would receive the Lord Jesus Christ as my saviour then I'd be better etc and 2 ----- that he never broke my wrist as a child, that it only broke once, and that was due to a bully at school, not him.   


This triggered me so much to hear. I can't put into words and I don't really know what to do. Because my dad did cause a fracture in my left wrist and it haunted me, and caused so much damage... I remember being in the hallway of the house, I remember him storming up to me, furious, rageful, and he pushed me into the wall. I remember my left wrist not being okay and being horrified. I remember being alone and crying in a room. I remember the information of it being a fracture. I also did have a person in primary school pick on me, and in the girls bathroom, she purposely tripped me over, and this caused a fracture in my left wrist. I remember she stood there laughing as I cradled it. I suspect my dad only knows about this incident at school, because I had to remind my mum as an adult, and she probably recently told him. Both of these incidents didn't happen far from each other, but this is when it gets difficult for me, I struggle to remember anymore which one happened first, and if they where a few months a part, weeks a part, or one year. I wish I remembered, but I just get overwhelmed trying to remember these details.   


What has lead me to feeling that I cannot cope, that I don't feel okay, that I feel trapped, is this late afternoon when I got home from my appointment. Before my mum asked me about my appointment, I approached her first, and asked her if we could speak about it in confidentiality. I emphasized that anything I said about my appointment could not be shared with anyone at all. She agreed. When I started to tell her about my father, and what he said in the email about never fracturing my wrist, that it was a school incident, and that I was very upset, she started saying to me, the exact things my father did... that my father never fractured my wrist... that my wrist only fractured once.... 

I don't know how to explain how I feel. My body and mind. What do you do when you grow up in a household, you experience abuse, but no one acknowledges, and/or they don't remember, therefore - it's not real? What does that make me? I just can't :'( I had broke down to my mum in 2016 and confronted her about in incident with my dad in hall with my wrist, and she went pale as a ghost, she came back later to my share house, and said she believed me, and that she blocked out a lot things. I felt like all this time, she has at least been on my side since 2016 with that particular incident, and since that year, is when I begun to develop a relationship with her.  


But right now I'm feeling really overwhelmed, and I don't feel emotionally and mentally safe with her. I don't know if I am overreacting or not. Also, I am sorry for this long post. I just feel so alone. More alone than I can possibly put into words. What if that little girl and what what she experienced isn't real. What does it make this pain? And me? That memory from so long ago, that time, shaped me. It does not affect me with the same intensity, because I have spoken of it in therapy many times. I just feel so confused though. What is one supposed to do, if they are a child at the time, in a household, where no one acknowledges the neglect and abuse going on? Being on disability, I feel conflicted, scared and trapped. I don't feel I have a chance of expanding beyond family, and making connections with other people (that's been traumatizing in the past). I feel trapped, and so deeply sad. I feel hopeless. I don't mean ill will to my mum by saying any of this, but being in the same house as her right now, and her being my only source of connection, doesn't feel healthy for me, and I don't know what I'm going to do. I feel trapped. I don't know what to do about either of my parents, and what to think about what they are saying about my trauma. I am wondering if anybody else has had any sort of experiences that could be similar in some way. Has anyone ever questioned them self as well? I feel like I am all over the place.   


Also, when she was speaking to me earlier (we were in the living room), saying these things and agreeing with my dad, I had to walk away from her in tears to my bedroom. A while later she came to my bedroom, and confronted me here. I don't want to talk about it much, because it was really intense, but she just kept telling me firmly there was only one fracture, not by my dad, even though I was crying and telling her this is my trauma and body, and I ended up actually raising my voice to tell her to leave, which I hated doing.  


Anyways, in truth I am not sure how to end this post,

I did the thing! I just got up and went for it and I am working on being less harsh on myself, being ok with me RIGHT NOW, not the me who was way more active or skinnier or whatever. I'm actively working things out. 

I've struggled with weight issues MY WHOLE LIFE. 

I was accused of being anorexic in my younger years and that wasn't even true. My Aunty and my Mum sat me down and FORCED ME TO EAT. Granted I was concerned about my figure at a young age, but what girl or boy for that matter new to puberty Isn't? I know they were in their own way looking out for me, but it was for all the wrong reasons. 

It was also basically tattooed into our minds as kids that WE HAD TO EAT what was on our plates before we could do anything else or we simply wouldn't be getting anything else! A hard and confusing lesson all in one. 

My addiction to food was rooted in insecurity, shame, guilt, associated with ""being wrong"" and yes your girl loves a cheeseburger as much as the next guy, but that feeling of needing to feel full was coming from a place of feeling EMPTY elsewhere. I was using Food as a Self-Medicating Method and damn... Something has totally clicked in my mind now that has allowed me to move on from some really bad behaviours. I have hope where I hadn't before and today is a HUGE day for me. 

I have lost a WHOLE LOT of weight twice in my life (30kgs+ each time) and yo-yoed up and down all over the shop. I am currently at a weight that is just too heavy. But today and yesterday have been great wins in the smallest of ways! But with the biggest impact. 

My Pandemic Pounds are indeed all my doing, but also I've had issues with Depression, Suicidal Thoughts being a Survivor of sexual abuse and some extremely unhealthy Self-Harming habits.

I have been reading comments made by fellow Texans about their living conditions during the winter storms. It finally struck me why I have felt so frozen/disconnected this week. 

When I was a kid, I was often cold. My mother was basically convinced that all methods of heating our home that were available to us would kill us. Later in my childhood, we lived in a home with central air and heat and I never had to sleep in temperatures below 55-58 degrees again, but before that happened, it was normal for me to see my breath in the mornings when I woke up. My mom would light the heater for short periods of time. I remember falling asleep on the floor in front of the heater every morning. It was the only time I could sleep and be warm. 

It struck me that my bed during that time was this giant waterbed. The heating pad for it was broken and my mother saw no reason to replace the heater or get a mattress instead of the giant bag of cold water I was forced to sleep on. That is, she didn’t see a reason to fix it for me. My sister came to live with us. She is a lot older than me and has kids my age. She moved into my brother’s room with her kids. That meant my brother took over my bedroom and left me with no where to sleep besides the foot of my mother’s bed. I think this is when they replaced the bag of water with a mattress. My brother (five years older than me) was cold and my mom fixed the issue for him. 

When I slept at the foot of my mothers bed, she would warm her ice cold feet on my torso. She had me hug her feet and put my face in my shirt so I could blow warm air on her feet. When she was warm enough, she would pull her feet out of my shirt and curl up to sleep. I then had to keep my head in my shirt so my breath could eventually warm me up enough to sleep. 

I swore my kid would never have to worry about being too cold or having enough food to eat or being afraid of getting hit. And he doesn’t. I have done so much work on myself, but this week has been so hard. At any moment, my home could lose power and/or water. I wake up and listen for the heater or check to see if my phone is still charging. I turn on the water and hold my breath until I see water coming out. Yesterday morning I woke to outside temperatures above freezing for the first time all week and could hear dripping water. At first I thought I could be hearing a busted pipe and I was so scared.

A couple of examples: I had a friend I had a falling out with, and when I saw her a few months later, I ran up and yelled her name with happiness and talked to her for about 10 minutes before I remembered that I was actually upset with her. Maybe 5 years ago, I saw an ex-boyfriend that I'd blocked because he stood me up twice, and again I yelled his name and had a catch-up conversation. He looked confused and awkward the entire time but I just talked to him like I was super happy to see him. I remembered about 5 minutes after he walked away that he was actually a pretty big jerk to me. This past year alone, this has happened with a guy I work with and a guy I dated who was also a bit of a jerk - he treated me like I was a secret, which turned out to be a huge trigger for me and caused a literal toddler-like bawling episode (which I at least could hold off until I was in the privacy of my own home). My theory is that I needed to be able to forget peoples' bad behaviour because I either had to work with them (my former boss was a difficult personality, but I *loved* that job) or I was in the same class (grew up in a tiny town where one of my classmates ""abused"" me from about age 5 or 6 -12 or 14, can't remember precisely).

I wanted to move forward together and wanted therapy to unpack this with her. She seemed resistant, and then further when I would bring up the topic of our abortion she would get angry and sad which is understandable. But my bringing of it up was to heal and move forward. 

She seemingly wanted to sweep it under the rug or hide it away. I can also understand why she wanted to do this. But as a couple its about working together, she could have told me she couldn't talk about it. Yet she got to a point months after our abortion that she told me she cannot handle me bringing up such a painful and traumatic topic again.

She went further as much as to tell me I am a negative person. And she only sees negativity now when she thinks about me. Ouch, yes this hurt me deeply because my actions have only been out of love and wanting us to move forward together. Even if its me just listening to her talk about it. 

By no means was I trying to force her to face her trauma, I was simply suggesting we share some things about it and see how we can move forward without simply shelving this. I would have been fine even doing individual therapy separately because I just know that this was a very traumatic moment for her especially and myself as well. 

Anyways, she left me after years together because she felt like I was making her unhappy, that she connected me to negativity now, and that she needs to be in a more positive place. Since then asking for no contact, and I have been respecting that. Unfortunately it hurts because again I was only trying to mend and work through this together. 

I have looked into being painted black, and I feel like thats what she did considering that I was only trying to support and love her and find healing, yet she took it completely differently as she felt I was bringing negativity into her life. 

What can I do, if anything?

Why would she paint that I was negative, she has a right to, but it just feels like she took only what she was feeling and didnt even account for my want for support nor the support I was showing. She went as far as to say our relationship and I were toxic because I was ""bringing up"" stuff that she has trauma around. But she only brought this up during our breakup, before she never mentioned that. 

If she would have mentioned this, I would have done my part to try to never bring it up, yet she did not and then in a way broke up with me because of it.

I am a very reflective person and had she said something about me triggering her PTSD earlier then our breakup I would have done what I could to not trigger her trauma. But unfortunately at that point the damage was done despite me only trying to grow through this difficult moment in our lives.

She connects me now to negativitity and that hurts, normally I am the friend or family member or even partner who tries to be optimistic, deeply caring and catering, and truly positive. She even goes as far to think I was purposely trying to hurt her by bringing this up she mentioned during the breakup. By not even a percent is that true. 

I tried to explain all of this to her and I mentioned I wished she would have said something earlier because I would have changed my approach to be more adapted to what she needs, but as I mentioned before never communicated until the breakup. 

Is there anyway to disconnect that negativitity in her mind and for her to see I was trying to be supportive? Time?",CPTSD,She told me I was triggering her.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lmgcv3/she_told_me_i_was_triggering_her/,1613602754.0
892,Just_One1,1613629331," I  don't know if that's normal or not.  I've certainly had issues with  depression and anxiety my entire life.  Several mental health diagnosises.  Nearly OD'd once.  Chronic suicidal ideation to a degree (not currently at risk).  Panic attacks at times.  Obsessive, unwanted thoughts.  Self harm.  Among other things.  I'm honestly thinking it was just circumstance sometimes, or in decent part.

At surface level childhood seems bad to meh, but when I look, it really starts to look fucked, with lots of holes.  Took a look at some old media the last  couple days, thinking it would remind me of the ""good ol days"", but it  brings back many more hurtful memories than not.  Even though there was some good, which makes me think maybe im just a bitch or something.  Still tons of gaps and all.  Usually it feels really blank, lonely, or only a small number of things come to mind.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\-Lots of yelling, crying, screaming, things breaking.  Apologies.

\-A time my Dad was drinking on either pain or sleep medication in the AM, and told me not to tell mom.

\-Calling  the Police on somebody we knew, who was an unwelcome home intruder.   Might have had a weapon that time.  Screaming.  He chased me.  When we  moved we worked hard to make sure they didn't know where.  He physically hurt me numerous times, and was pretty much devoid of any emotion.  Feared him.

\-Violent  bullying.  Occasionally to the point where severe injury might occur,  never taken seriously.  Head repeatedly smashed into a concrete fixture,  dragged across the floor once.  Threatened to kill me once.

\-Nearly  drowned to death under a pool covering, found by chance by a friend's  mom, who told me not to talk about it.

\-Unhinged  older ""friend"" who had survived a pitbull attack, and nearly killed  himself.  He may have later, can't remember.  Sharpened knives with  little me.  Talked about disturbing things.  Locked in a room once with  him.  Don't remember anything except he didn't want us to leave, and  people outside did.  Put a chair against the door and barricaded it shut  once.  He faced hospitalization at some point, and I'm pretty sure something worse eventually.

\-Loneliness in the dark.   Spent almost all my free time eating and watching TV alone.  Maybe only  one who was home, I don't know.  Bordered on neglect.  Later I fell into obesity and drug abuse.

\-Almost  certainly seeing a dude in black in the yard at like 11PM, our mesh  door being very fucked up making it seem likely.  I hid under the table and yelled for help.  Parents told me nobody was there  and not to worry.  The gun may have came out.

\-""Friend"" who told my little brother to strip while laughing, made him leave and cut him off after.

\-Depressed  friend who had AIDS, his mom telling me I had to stay away when he was  bleeding.  It may have been a dogbite or something sharp.  I wanted to  help him and didn't understand.  Think I got some blood on me and people  freaked out.  (For unrelated testing reasons as a young adult I know I  didn't get HIV).  I don't know if he's alive anymore.  I think I was  told not to hang around.  Wish we talked more, nice guy.

\-Falsely accused of assault by another asshole student for their gain, wasn't believed.  Treated poorly and assumed guilty as a result.

\-Having somebody threaten to stab and kill me.  Not being believed.  Police not involved by school.

\-Finding a bag of pills once on campus, being told not to talk about it by a staff member.  I think I thought it was candy.  Around the time of the painkiller explosion.  I remember the semi-often thing like a syringe in a park or playground, and how parents were very worried.

\-Some memory behind a shipping container and being grabbed on campus.  I have no clue what.  But I was very upset.  Wasn't able to leave.  It might have just been another beating.  I cried that day.

\-People were sometimes very worried about me, in tears, after situations I didn't understand or can't remember.

\-Never  felt upset watching gory movies, live police shows, Iraq war footage  stuff.  Lots of that.  The content somehow seemed normal, familiar even,  never bothersome or rare.  Never clicked.  I have empathy too.

\-Lived in some nasty Fontana/San Bernardino neighborhoods and had some REALLY sketchy neighbors before.  One of my oldest memories is police cars and loud noise outside an apartment window at night.

\-People around me extremely depressed at times.  Sometimes not making any effort to converse.

\-At times I didn't want to live, and put nerf guns to my head, pretending they were real, and layed there pretending to be dead.

COULD GO ON.

My  family only ever talks about good bits.  I love them,  and do my best to be a good son.  Try hard in school, cook for them  sometimes now.  But the more I look back, it really seems like a bad  time.  Interspersed with happy moments.  Did I experience trauma?  Is  there maybe more bad I'm not remembering too?  Those questions are  really kinda making me think.  My parents weren't great for a long time too, which makes me question it.

When  I pass the old house or school on a drive, it feels really, really  wrong.  Not trying to appropriate anything, certainly not trying to wave it around.  But it certainly seems like it was a pretty awful time, and I'm curious to learn more.  I don't even know if this stuff hints that it was traumatic, or is enough to say.  Maybe this is normal.  Maybe it's just bad in a normal sense.

896,MyLifeHurtsRightNow,1613626523,"I'm writing this for myself just as much as I'm writing this for y'all. All my miscellaneous thoughts that I want to share go here because it is, in my experience, a very kind and loving sub. Good habits, like reading every day and staying off your phone at night, are amazing for your mental health...most of the time. I've made a New Year's resolution to read and write every day. I want to finish writing my novel by next fall and want to read 30 books by the end of the year. I always leave my phone in the kitchen at night, so as to give my brain some mindful time both in going to sleep and waking up. I try to watch tv not too much, as I feel that it is wasteful. I grew up with work-ethic crazed parents, and it's super hard for me to stop working, stop being an efficiency machine. ""Wow, that's a wonderful thing. You must be very productive."" No, it is not wonderful, and yes, it is productive. I'm often touted as a great student and worker, but it's mostly at the expense of life's joys. Whatever, another conversation for another day.

Anywho. I'm currently snowed/iced in, which has put a few dents in my securities. I can't get to the gym, which is causing a lot of stress. My eating habits are getting particularly bad (I chewed and spat a box of valentine's chocolates today). Body image thoughts are distracting me from my online work. I can't get to work work, which would help me stop eating so much (and give me some human interaction).

I've found myself vegging a lot. I've been falling asleep with my phone in my hands because I can't do my daily sudoku without voices shouting in my head about how unlovable I am. I have skipped reading and writing the past few days to browse Reddit, which is a bit of a task since I deleted it from my phone several months ago (I do it on my laptop). I feel horrid about it. I feel so unproductive. Days absolutely wasted. Days I'll never get back. I have an app that helps me keep track of all my daily habits, and the fact that I broke both my writing and reading streak made me super upset. Plus, I really love writing and am so excited about my novel. I pour my heart and soul into weaving together worlds and characters and intertwining story arcs. I find purpose amongst the hundreds of thousands of words at my disposal, words able to capture even the most minute eye movements and breathing moments. Yet, right now, I can't bring myself to do it. I fear that it will never be done. It's been an offhand personal project for over a year now, I'd work on it whenever, but now, I feel as though the concept may be good enough for a published book! But perhaps I'll never finish it. Maybe it will be merely a sad half-finished unsound story left to erode in the depths of my google docs.

I think I am going to sit it out. Whip out the ol' (frankly loathsome) DBT skills and practice distress tolerance. I'm going to put on a Disney movie and paint my nails. Is it productive? No. Is it commendable? No. Will it make me loveable? No. Am I even *good* at it? No. Do I enjoy it? I think so. I'm not actually sure. I'm not used to enjoying things for the sake of enjoying things. Enjoying moments for the sake of those moments, rather than for the sake of what they'll look like from tomorrow. 

It's okay to live life like (immaculate assonance + alliteration, I'll say) a kayak on the river. It seems as though you've already got your vessel into a river headed toward your goals. You paddle as hard as you can, trying to get to your desired destination as fast as possible. You get sore, but that pain means progress, right? No pain, no gain, baybee. It means steps closer to your perfect dock. Some days, your muscles ache terribly, and you're unsure if you can even keep rowing. Just let the river take you. You're in the river for a reason; I mean, if you didn't want help, you could have just walked, ffs. Just let the river be your friend. 

I don't know what the fuck that terrible pos metaphor was. Word vomit, blec. I think that I'm trying to say that life should happen organically. Sure, we can incorporate good habits and practices, but we should let joy come to us. Let time take the wheel and notice that we've made it this far. Note the scenery. Is it ugly? Is it pretty? Is it scary? Where *are* we? Have we passed other people without noticing? I hope that I coherently relayed at least part of the wisdom I believe I have arrived at. It's pretty late at night, right now. I just can't sleep and wanted to share with other people. 

TL;DR It's okay to veg out. It's okay to stop working. It doesn't make you a bad person. It doesn't mean that your goals will never happen.

&amp;#x200B;

All I've had was self-reflection and Google research, and I feel like they've served my growth really well, but I don't know *how* well, as opposed to trying therapy again. Here and there, I write reflections about how I was raised, how it might have impacted me, how I often felt, what behaviors I'd repeat, and more. I've developed a better understanding of the source of my attachment issues and recurring nightmares. I notice how I lose my train of thought recounting memories when they're upsetting.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently went through my first relationship- well... *""situationship,""* that felt like a rollercoaster of discovery about new info I never needed to know before: love-bombing, distancing, cognitive dissonance, needs, gaslighting, attachment theory... and much more. I felt like I was rapidly learning and finding potential answers throughout, and even now I'm reflecting on what happened and I'm reading a book to better assess myself and my side of the problems that I contributed to it. It feels like I'm constantly adapting and ready to bring up my mistakes... but the positive thinking always comes along!

My abuser was my mom. She’s a paranoid schizophrenic with a personality disorders and homicidal and suicidal tendencies. And probably undiagnosed CPTSD since she was also abused as a child. 

Her condition just... boiled over, onto me while I was still a child. I know that now and I feel empathy for her. Even going through what I do with CPTSD, I cant imagine the confusion and horror and pain she felt. I can’t imagine what even she goes through now as an adult still alone, though she’s completely unaware of herself. I worry sometimes that I’ll become just like her. That the rug will be pulled out from under my feet and she’ll be there, staring back at me in the mirror. 

I feel sorry for her, and almost jealous. Because I know that in her fantasy land in her head, everything for herself is okay and reality is secondary.

For a very long time I’ve felt nothing but resentment towards her and what she’s done to me... but underneath all that, I feel so sorry for what she has to live through every day and the person she’s become as a result.. I used to wish revenge on her. Now I wish nothing but healing. I cry for it sometimes, hoping one day she’ll stop bubbling over and be able to be happy again. I remember small snipets of my childhood when I saw her smile, all before 10 years old, so I know she’s been suffering and it’s been awhile. 

Even through all this I still call her Mom. Here’s a letter I wrote to her: 

Dear Mom, I hope you find your happiness eventually. I know that me and B**** leaving was  really hard for you and probably pushed you over the edge even further into your condition. We never meant to hurt you, only to protect ourselves. And we loved you very much. You’re not a horrible person. You’re not some devil. You’re just sick.. you’re so very sick and I hope you get the medicine and recovery that you need some day. I wish I could say that I still love you but I don’t.. what I do feel is care for you. I care for you, and I will till we’re both gone.. deep down inside all of that I know that you’re a good, sweet person. I saw it a few times when I was little. But I know that your thinking is disordered and illogical, and I wish you could feel this love I have for you and allow it to make you whole.

904,JConnell13,1613623221,"I am realizing that I thought all parents would beat their kids, as it was a way of installing discipline. It's kind of a shock to read now about all the healthy ways to enforce discipline in a constructive way, that don't involve hitting, beating or humiliating them.  
That might sound basic, but I just thought as a kid (and now as an adult) that every child gets hit and beaten if they are naughty.

Like, my thoughts seem to have been: they must deserve it, how else will they learn?   
But it certainly didn't help me at all. My parents weren't able to set healthy boundaries and teach me how to behave better, so they just got angry as hell and beat me instead. 

  
This has really impacted my life and I'm amazed that I took this for granted for so long. My parents never sat with me and explained things about how to behave and relate to others.

I know it sounds fairly strange, making a game about it. But I thought maybe it'd help me a little bit, to see things maybe more in perspective. Perhaps this is a little pretentious, but I'm hopeful that it'll help me, and I'm here because I want to know if certain events were blown out of proportion by my own bias and feelings. I apologize for the long post. 

All my life, I feel like I've walked on eggshells near my father. He's always been an omen, like a rain cloud always hovering in the distance, and the storm never too far behind.

There was never any winning with him. He had the unique talent of somehow always coming on top in arguments, or going around in so many circles that you would eventually give up fighting altogether. The fights were a regular thing, monthly, weekly, between him and my mother, between him and me. In the end, everyone would always get caught in the middle. 

He always spoke in a way like riddles. Never actually telling me what he wanted, but always expecting I would somehow just know. And then get angry when I didn't. When I told him to just speak like everyone else, he made it sound like *I* was demanding him to change so that *I* could feel better. And then demanded to know what right *I* had for demanding *him* to change.

He always felt like we owed him something. Gifts were brought back in arguments as ammunition: *I fed you, I clothed you, I bought you a phone, and this is how you treat me?* And use it as the argument that he was always the victim in these arguments. 

All of these led to arguments.

In the fights, inevitably I would always end up in tears, and he would always get angrier at me for crying. I remember very vividly what he thought about my crying: 

""It's a personality trait, some people are just naturally weak."" 

After I told him that I was threatened by him and that I couldn't really control whether or not I cried: ""Why the hell would you feel threatened by me?"" For context, a couple of years ago, he flew into a rage over and I ended up calling the police because of how much it escalated.

However, he's managed to somehow justify his own actions by blaming it on me: ""I didn't want to do what I did, it's just that you didn't do your chores like you were supposed to."" Alongside: ""I was hit by my parents, too when I was younger if I did things like failing a test."" It's true: he didn't hurt me, he grabbed me, but he didn't hit me. It makes me wonder if my trauma is less valid than I feel like it is.

After fights, he would sometimes ignore us for weeks and give us the cold shoulder. 

Or, the next day, he'll pretend that nothing happened or rationalize everything he did. I think the worst thing is that, he never once told me that he was sorry. It was always me: never because I wanted to, but always because I just wanted it to be over. 

Boundaries didn't exist to him, but we were always tiptoeing, scared of even looking past his line. And he was always shifting, always volatile. Having an opinion was wrong, but not having an opinion meant I was stupid. Talking to him about the things I was interested in meant having my interests belittled or dismissed, but not talking to him was also wrong.  

And the funny thing is, he never thought he did anything wrong. Or he never thought he was the one that was most wrong. 

That's another thing that frustrates me. In Asia, family is prioritized above else. So is face: you never call the police on your own family, and everything else is fixed behind closed doors. The day I called the cops, I can vividly remember my grandmother (father's mother) telling me to say good things about him. So they don't take him away forever. 

And then when I came back, she sobbed to me, telling me that my father didn't mean it. That he was just stressed. 

I was debating with myself so much on whether or not I wanted to make this game. Whether to make this post. I'm terrified of him finding out, the same way I'm anxious at the sound of his footsteps, startling when I hear him raise his voice, when I hear he and my mother talking, even if it's just normally. 

Even now, I feel like I'm questioning my own trauma: I talk to a counsellor regularly, but for almost as long as I can remember, I've been told that this was normal. What happening was normal; the fights, the yelling. And that I needed to learn to be strong so my trauma would no longer affect me. I know that's not true, but at the back of my mind there's always that doubt, and I'm always afraid that I'm just making everything bigger than it actually was. 

That's why I'm making the game.

923,hatetheseparties521,1613614668,"Just in advance this will probably be long so sorry for that.

I don't know where to begin. My mind is a mess. I think I have dissociation or depersonalization. Around the age of 12 I think I kept so much bottled in that something happened. I just stopped feeling and my face became rigid and hateful looking. I acted nice and stuff to other people but I think inside I turned the hate to myself. 

I think the reason I ended up this way was because I kept so much shit to myself. I was getting bullied at school and I didn't talk to anyone about it. I had no friends either for a while and I felt like a loser and I also pretended like I was fine. I would constantly think about it though. Every single day I would try to solve my ""problems"" in my head. I tried to diagnose why I had no friends and tried to fix it. I don't even remember the stuff I would do. I think I used to google the stuff I was going through and then would try what other people suggested. Stuff like acting confident, trying to listen better, focus on other people, like all the bullshit advice you see on the internet I would try. Usually I was fine around my friends but would shut down around certain people. I still was a funny kid. 

Then when I turned 12 and went numb I think my sense of humor went out of the window too. I think I completely lost myself by that point. I remember noticing that every single day just seemed to blur together. It felt like I was living the same day over and over unlike before where each day had its own flavor and I could remember things i did during the week. I remember asking my mom about it because I was worried i had alzheimers. I used to have a really good memory and afterwards I had a horrible one. 

In highschool I think I started to hate myself. I thought certain times I was angry or bullied others when i was younger was the reason I was such a bad person. I remember thinking that I could train my brain to forget. I remember feeling like before this stuff happened I was innocent and pure and afterwards I had this blemish on my life that I couldn't erase. I guess I thought that if I kept forcing those thoughts out of my brain, then after a while I would forget about it.

I think my relationship with my brain has been pretty bad like that. Throughout the years I would always feel like ""If I do this, then maybe I'll improve."" I would keep trying all these mental things to try to trick myself into being more confident, funny, outgoing, basically the person I wanted to be. I wanted to have friends so badly. I always would try different mental ""tricks or techniques"" and when they wouldn't work I would just move onto the next one and I'd be like, ""Maybe this time it will work."" I don't know why I couldn't see how nothing I was doing was working. I think part of it is because the blurring of time. It's like I lost my sense of time so everyday just felt like a new day with no connection to the last.

I'm 26 years old now and have been trying to heal but I am still struggling with some parts. I think one thing is that I have so much trouble trusting my own thoughts/feelings/actions. I have tried to like cognitively override, suppress my thoughts, deny things in my head, pretend like I didn't see certain thoughts, stuff like that, that it feels like I don't even know where ""I"" am anymore. Like I did that shit so much that now it feels like I still do that stuff without even trying. Like I'll be alone or something and I'll see something or think something and I'll make a face or a reaction to it that I'm ""supposed"" to make even though that's not what I would actually do. I get frustrated with myself because I feel so fake that it's become me. I feel like a psycho too. Who the fuck does this stuff? I also don't know whether I am acting/pretending or not. It's a weird feeling but I feel that way most of the time. Even now, it's like a part of me feels like I'm writing this post because I somehow feel like I'm ""supposed"" to do it to heal. 

I don't know what to make of this or how to stop doing this to myself. All I want is to feel like me again but I get so frustrated at myself for doing this shit. It's like I can't trust myself to just be. It's like everything I do has an ulterior motive that I'm not even aware of consciously half the time. I feel like I fucked myself up real good in a way. I don't know if anyone has gone through similar. I feel really alone because I can't imagine anyone would understand and I don't think I've tried to tell a therapist even though I should.

I apologize for the length of this: first I'll share a little about myself and then my current problem. The TL:DR; is the title so please feel free to skip my background below.

I did not have a happy upbringing and as a result I ran away a lot and other than my time in the military I have essentially lived in isolation my entire life. Unfortunately, this means that I struggle hard with social situations to the point that it is disabling.

If you take a quick peek at my post history, you'll see some examples of my work which I have given myself fully into for the past 3 years. I started doing all that while I was homeless, and the thing of it is, my anxiety was so severe that I couldn't do any interviews or take up any of the opportunities that were given to me. In fact, 2 engineers from Google visited me at the homeless shelter in 2018 to give me a computer and phone in person since I literally could not zoom with them from anxiety...they were so determined to talk to me that they came by train from out of state to do so.

I have ran the gauntlet of medication for bipolar, schizophrenia, and various other misdiagnosis for the last 10+ years until I found my recent therapist last year who was able to determine that I have complex ptsd. And it's literally changed my life.

I've grown so much since then and while I still struggle I'm at least now able to speak with people. In fact, I'm actually in my 2nd art + code residency and while I have had a few embarrassing mental breakdowns while giving talks (including once completely disassociating and just turning off my camera mid speak to the bewilderment of everyone) I'm at least able to try. And I'll continue to try!

But here's the problem: my therapist who has basically held my hand throughout this entire radical growth process is now leaving to another state to start a private practice. And I'm devastated. Honestly, for the past few weeks I have been sleeping all day from depression and have not been productive at all as I don't know how I'm going to continue healing with a complete stranger.

Have any of you lost a therapist? How have you dealt with it? Rationally I know it will be ok but I'm not rational right now :(

My depression is getting a little hard to deal with (but I'm safe and all that), and already I've had to disable my social medias and delete posts from sharing too much information. In a way I feel like I was approaching the finish line of ptsd and fell flat on my face just before crossing.

929,HenryLafayetteDubose,1613610570,"For some context, I was thinking about one of my parents today, and a memory came back about how they used to have me do chores around the house/yard to ""build character"". Yeah, sure, some of them were regular chores you'd have a kid to do (like sweeping, dusting, raking leaves, feeding pets, etc.), but I remembered this parent alluding that certain chores were saved especially for me to do when I was there (I'd have to guess custody was split 70/30). 

Some examples of these chores (that I can remember actually doing) were stacking firewood then restacking it when it was ""unstable"" and fell over, trimming a bush that was about ten inches taller than me, cleaning carious rooms (read tidying, sweeping, organizing, and wiping counters/tables) to their standards, vacuuming various rooms to their standards and redoing it if ""I missed that spot under the desk because I didn't move the chair to vacuum there"", detailing their cars (read vacuuming, clearing trash, and wiping down) to their standards. 

What I actually wanted to share is a reflection I wrote in my journal just a bit ago: 

""I just had a thought. Has it ever occurred to you to think about the definition of “character building”, and what it might mean? I was thinking about this last night and came to the conclusion that “character building” can be lots of different things. I’ll just say what a couple of these possible definitions may be, based on my experiences and personal opinion to provide some examples.

""Example One: “Character building” is working on building your character, or -- in other words -- working on editing, adapting, and adjusting your personality to become the person you want to be or present yourself as. Example Two: “Character building” seems to be the discipline and motivation to better yourself, resulting in becoming the person you want to be. There are many more, but for the sake of simplicity, these are the only two that apply to my next bit. 

""I came to the conclusion that my anxiety problem is not a personality trait. It is the long snake (or possibly a small part of the long snake) of mental illness that runs in my blood. It is something attached to me, and have learned to live with. I may be able to make it shrink from time to time, but it will never go away. I’ve accepted this. One thing I will no longer accept is “work ethic” as a personality trait. “Work ethic” is -- in my personal opinion -- is definitely not a personality trait. 

“Work ethic” is something I believe you learn to have. Because you learn to appreciate working. And as a result, you learn to appreciate the reward that comes from doing good work or working for a long time. You learn it because everyone learns some form of discipline at some point in their lives. People budget. People get up on time. People say “not right now” and “after I finish...” when they have work to do. For better or worse, and whether it’s good, bad, or in-between, I think everyone learns to have a work ethic.""",CPTSD,"In case it might help someone who had a parent/parents like mine.

930,alwaysbereasonable,1613608235,"So, I had an epiphany today that the random bouts of a deep, heavy (yet ambiguous) sadness mixed with an intense desire for something/anything cathartic that I get daily are probably... not necessarily “normal”.
I’ve noticed some things certainly trigger it like coming home after work to my empty house (I mean I have furniture but no roommates or pets) and workouts oddly enough (which is strange because I believe they’re supposed to make you happier). But even outside of these triggers, I get between 2-5 of these moments everyday when I just have this profuse sadness seemingly out of nowhere— I can be putting laundry away or looking out the window to see the weather or driving to work or something... and it’s just such a heavy feeling and it gives me this huge impulse to do anything cathartic like cry or devour something crunchy until my jaw hurts (lol) or sprint or whatever. I pretty much always just wait for it to pass though and keep doing whatever I’m doing. 
I wouldn’t call it a depression thing (I have/had that) because it’s not an empty feeling, just a vague but deeply emotive sadness. The moments last anywhere from a minute to an hour or so, but typically lean towards 3-20 minutes I’d say. 

I suppose it’s not a big deal because I don’t let it get in the way too much, but gosh how nice would it be to not feel like I’m in the bottom of the ocean multiple times every day.

935,cometsandcomas,1613604849,"This may be a bit long because I'm honestly losing my mind with this. I gotten so, so stressed and angry about this. (I never take it out on the cat bc I know it's not his fault). I'm posting this here and not in the cat advice subreddit because of all the intense stress I'm getting from this, on top of my regular cptsd stress. 

I got my 8 year old cat at the beginning of December 2020. He acts like he's a prisoner here and I can't keep him happy. 

He meows at the closed bathroom door all day long. Once inside he'll meow at the cabinet door. I've tried a whole range of things. I let him explore the bathroom as much as he pleases, including lifting him up to view all the cabinet shelves and letting him sit on one. Then most recently no one was allowed to let him into the bathroom ever for any reason whatsoever. We thought he'd give up if he knew he'd never have a chance. But now he storms into the bathroom right when someone exits the bathroom, then flops over and goes limp so he can't be picked up. 

I can't let him meow all day because there's another apartment on the other side of the bathroom wall, and people living above me. I don't even think it's about the bathroom--i think he's just having general bad feelings of ""bored, stressed, escape, ect"". And he directs that at the bathroom door for some reason. That's my theory at least? Sometimes he'll stand with his front legs of various walls and just meow upwards. I don't think he knows where the real front door is (the door opens into a little hallway with yet another door at the end that he's never seen much of). 

He doesn't exactly anxiously pace the apartment, but it FEELS like he paces all day. He's got various discontent behavior. 

He seems to like me enough, but he won't sit next to me and let me pet him for very long before he becomes bored (?). He doesn't play on his own very much, doesn't really ""do his own thing"". I have a wand toy and use that to play with him, but I am here with him ALL day long, and I can't continually use the wand toy over and over and over. I sit on the floor with him because he seems to like that better than being on the couch with me, but he gets tired of that too. I sit on the floor to do art so he can watch me, but he doesn't care. I even let him sniff the tea bags when I make tea to add ANY kind of interest into his life. 

When I wash dishes he stands up against my legs and meows and claws a little and does ""half-bites"" where he basically bites but doesn't bite down hard enough to do anything. He gets bored when I do anything at all, but he really doesn't like when I do dishes. 

He seems way more content when my boyfriend visits me in the evenings. I guess because he can watch us interact with each other, which is more interesting than watching me do my quiet hobbies all day?

We bought a bird feeder to watch, but it's winter. We bought a cat harness, but... It's winter.  

He wasn't an outdoor cat before but he apparently liked being in the garden occasionally. He lived with the same family for 8 years. 

I purposely sought out a cat that loved human attention because I was worried I'd be too affectionate for an aloof cat to tolerate, but that's been completely thrown in my face! Also, I used to sleep all day to avoid bad feelings and loneliness, and I got a cat so I could have a little buddy to hang out with instead of avoiding being awake, but he's absolutely not chill and HATES when I sleep (now I only do that when he naps too) yet doesn't like when Im awake either. 

I'm getting really paranoid thinking I'm neglecting him and that I'm a bad person for not fixing this somehow.

936,vensterbankje,1613604703,"Inspired by another post, and especially the comments in this subreddit. 

I feel torn between what I think I need and what is happening. Because of my cptsd I can not always live in the moment, I can't see what's right in front of me. And this is hurting me in relationships. 

For once I am dating a great guy, we've been together for 1.5 years. We actually have taken a break before, only to reconcile and grow stronger together. Last month he fell back in to depression and problems stemming from his youth . Both not having an example of good love, this proved to be hard and we're on a break now.

It's exhausting. We want to be together. It's not black and white. My expectations of love are too high, I want this, that, butterflies always, he needs to make me feel special, he needs to do special things for me. I just cannot see that he can't right now as I dive into my safe fantasy world . But how do I know that what I need is too much ? 

He is not perfect either. Bringing up his problems is hard for him. I feel like I can't listen as I should, as I am used to being the problematic one, the one that needs help. Communication is fine, it is amazing sometimes, and it's okay the others. I felt like I wanted our communication to be amazing always, talked about it with friends, and those replied that responding correctly to a situation is hard and communication won't always go as I want it .

For me, love needs to be always doing the right thing. Being there when I need him. Honeymoon forever. He can make no mistake but I can. We decided on a break since I cried again because I felt like he was failing me. And I realized he could do nothing right at this moment. 

He's an amazing person, compassionate and trying, funny, sweet, a great cook, honest , ect. He just falls behind sometimes, and I'm blind to it.

I just want to throw this out here. We both need work. Right now it feels like a waiting game.

937,koroshiya616,1613604136,"I have CPTSD from being a survivor of CSA. 

I've recently started going to therapy to work through this, and I picked a therapist who had very good educational credentials and is experienced in trauma etc.

It was the third session when I opened up about what happened to me and as I was discussing more, being extremely vulnerable, she mentioned: ""it's possible that she (I was abused by another child) was oversexualised"".

I have never had a therapist do this before. It hurts a lot.

938,valeriantincture,1613603014,"Hi, just wanting to hear if anyone has had any similar experiences w their diagnoses. In the end I don't entirely mind what my diagnosis is as I'm about to begin DBT therapy regardless (my therapist would like me to expand my window of tolerance via DBT so I can begin EMDR).

I was diagnosed with BPD in 2019. I've begun seeing a new therapist who specialises in BPD and mostly works w/ BPD patients. She's pretty certain I was misdiagnosed and don't have BPD at all and instead have CPTSD. This is mostly because I don't experience any of the lack of sense of self that comes with BPD, and also do not idealise/devalue. However I do match the majority of CPTSD symptoms. I'd need to see a psychiatrist so actually get a diagnostic assessment, she's not able to diagnose me but as she's so experienced with BPD, I do trust her opinion. I've been thinking this myself for a while (that there's a chance I don't have BPD). 

I was wondering if anyone else here was initially diagnosed with BPD before discovering they have CPTSD? I'm of course not certain yet regarding my diagnosis, and as I said above I'm not sure it matters too much as imo diagnosis mostly exists just to inform the course of treatment. Regardless it would be interesting to hear back from anyone who has experienced similar. I do feel that BPD is over-diagnosed in women (I literally have *five* female friends who have been through significant traumas and gotten a BPD diagnosis) and that my presentation of trauma symptoms combined with being a woman could have lead to my diagnosis.",CPTSD,CPTSD potentially misdiagnosed as BPD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lm7ap6/cptsd_potentially_misdiagnosed_as_bpd/,1613574214.0

I do have multiple therapist and started EMDR last week, but the psychiatrist who prescribes my medication is cold. I remained with her because she offers TMS and other things I may consider in the future, but she also is the only psychiatrist I could find who prescribes stimulants for ADHD and takes my insurance. She has a charting system where she tracks all my symptoms and behaviors and makes me rate them based on the last month or try to recall how often I cried or whatever. I already felt it dismissed the need for such emotions, or crying, but in Oct my cat died, and then I had an early miscarriage at Christmas, and my bf was unsupportive. The EMDR brought up emotions unexpectedly related to abuse and my cat and memories - it stripped away all this unconscious repression and distraction and stuffing down and I realized that the pain and other negative emotions I hold is actually far, far greater than I realized. I also realized I spend much of my time distracting myself or numbing myself to keep these emotions at bay. EMDR WILL be helpful, based on everything I've learned. I asked my bf to not dismiss my emotions if I am sad, just sit with me and let me be sad. I'm not talking about crying - its difficult to cry these days. But he reacted poorly and then fell into a depressive state. I mentioned to my parents I was in an open relationship and they went full verbal abuse screaming, terrible name calling, nonsensical, telling me im going to hell. I took two pills that might be unsafe to mix but am safe since. I blocked my parents and my bf doesn't want to deal. I reached out to the one other person in my bubble, his mother, but she hasnt responded. I didnt tell her everything in my vm, but I told her about my parents and a loss. In the days since, I found out my brother has severe chronic suicidality. This is ... a lot. And yet my therapist never validated my feelings or acknowledged my coping strategies. Instead, she scolded me agitatedly because I'd relapsed briefly into drinking but stopped again. I have not drank since any of this drama went down this week. I take my prescribed xanax or I take kratom. I reach out to my mental health team and I talk to ppl I only talk to online. But the people I see in person are no where. I feel like I'm being punished by my bf and his mother for experiencing sad events, they both don't like to talk about sad stuff. at all. But there's a limit to what I can take. So when my psychiatrist doesn't even confirm that any of this is distressing, but goes off about alcohol use for many minutes when I stopped again, it just sucks. I get that she doesn't want me to mix it with medication. On days I drank, I didn't take any downers or anything. I'm not actually on SSRIs or antidepressants at this time. I just want to continue EMDR after discussing coping skills with the specialist, and focus on healing from a lifetime of trauma. And I'm so very tired of people in my life telling me to just get over things or to not talk about it. Because if the pain that I felt during EMDR is the pain that I keep inside me chronically, then I at least need to do EMDR to heal. Underneath the abyss of pain, shame, guilt, doubt, anger - I glimpsed ...strength. Strength and resilience I didn't know I had. I'm here. Despite losing my parents and possibly my partner and his mother, I'm attending appts, doign self care, not drinking or self harming. And I hate that she acts like a crying session is bad when I only cry at the worst. I don't let myself cry because I fall into that abyss for a bit and...  so what? If I stop seeing her I lose stimulants and the chance to do TMS again after covid. Also, I feel so guilty and ashamed that I drank for a while. I will be talking to the EMDR specialist about hearing that benzodiazepines interfer with EMDR so I will be talking about if I need to go off those meds (thats ok, I dont typically take xanax) but the thing about EMDR is that I'm at my limit for people either dismissing or minimizing emotional events, or acting like I'm a bad person for engaging in harmful coping strategies to get through the pain (if im doing better and trying the hardest i can). thanks for not even saying you're sorry to hear about these things, doc.

The past couple of days I've been staying at my parents house due to the snow storm. I left my car at my house (Stupid thing to do) because my car is terrible for snow. So, I've been stuck. No way out. 

One thing about my past was when I was kicked out, I went and lived with the guy who I was talking too and met once. He took me in but I didn't know how abusive he was going to be. I was not allowed to leave the house or have a job. He worked offshore so I was stuck inside for two weeks at a time. He didn't want me to be independent (his words). The one time I walked outside while he was there, he forced me back inside, raped me while holding my throat and screaming in my face how terrible of a person I was and how I needed to be better. If I moved in bed, he would choke me or rape me. He had to have sex 6+ times a day, every day he was there even if I didn't want too. I had so many day where I went into a dissociative attack and completely shut down and was unable to move and staring out into space while he did what ever. 

I left him after he was threatening to throw me in an insane asylum because I was fighting him due to already having PTSD from being mentally, physically and sexually abused by my biological father and watching a close family member die at my knees. Three days into homelessness I found out I was pregnant with my daughter through rape by him.

So, these past few days I've been having physical flashbacks of the rapes that have been extremely painful.

Today it hit me. I was stuck. I wanted to vomit. I started panicking, crying, hitting myself. I took a scolding shower, paced the floor while shaking. Then the numbness hit my face and brain. I started stuttering, and slowly stopped being able to move. I quickly sat down before I went into a seizure. Luckily, I did in time because as soon as I sat I couldn't move. I got tunnel vision and stared into space. My body was so heavy I couldn't even move my head. I can barely remember the things that happened. It only lasted 10 minutes according to my sister. If I hadn't of sat down, I would of had a seizure as that is how they all start.

Now I just feel like shit. I still feel sick and shaky... But I just feel... Bad. For everyone around me. I just hate my brain and my responses.

949,kelly_1979,1613596769,"I'm trans MtF 41 yrs old. I've been transitioning for 4 months and still living with my elderly narcissistic parents. I'm working on finishing a project on my PhD (extremely tight deadlines but HAVE to finish). I've been under lots of verbal and mental, emotional abuse over the years (empty threats of kicking me out when I wanted to transition in the early years of my PhD etc). I won't write details of the abuse but suffice to say they have broken me. I went from a happy, oblivious young adult to a severely damaged one with severe health issues due to constant abuse.

I've been stuck into this ""apathy, rage, sadness, freeze"" mode for so long that I can't find a way to escape from it.(It's also that my body has been so much ruined by stress it increases  gender dysphoria tenfold if not more).

&amp;#x200B;

By reading I've found out I've developed CPSTD due to constant (even sometimes subtle) abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been so long but I'm still struggling with coping. When starting my transition I went for 12 sessions (or so) to a LGBT therapist who helped me put boundaries with my parents, my professor, colleagues etc.

She did help a lot but after a point I felt we were not making any progress so I stopped.

Then I went to a EMDR - certified therapist because I thought EMDR could help me with all this stress.

I went there for three sessions. Initially he seemed OK but after thinking back to the sessions I noticed couple of red flags so I stopped going there too. It seemed pointless going to a therapist who I no longer found compatible or liked his opinions etc.

I know I might need EMDR but I don't know if it's the best solution right now.

The way I see it this apathy might reduce on it's own as my transition progresses and hopefully my health issues lessen.

Right now my transition seems kinda stalled, which increases by dysphoria. I also have so much rage suppressed towards my narcissists parents. I can't even begin to describe how this feels.

However right now the main issue is not so much my parents but the health problems (stress/ abuse related) I keep having even after starting HRT.

My cpstd - related (possibly some) issues that I CONTINUE to have are: fatigue, muscle pain/ loss, bad short term memory/ brain fog, apathy broken by extreme need to cry but unable to.

Especially the brain fog and poor short term memory are extremely debilitating especially while trying to finish my PhD. Somebody will tell me something and I might forget it in a few seconds. Things I do while not 100% focused will not even get registered. 

Things I did few days ago are from hazy to blank, depending on the importance of the events.

Events older than couple of days may be completely forgotten unless they are very important. Most details are forgotten.  

This is exacerbated from every now and then feeling crushing sadness from the degree of destruction I left myself to end up into. I then feel an overwhelming need to cry but it's impossible, except from a short silent cry.

I have to be able to finish this PhD project (capable enough) but I don't want to feel like a robot anymore. I want to be able to feel.

Hi everyone!

A few months back, I had to leave my partner and move to my home country due to my visa expiry. Our last days together were very tough on us and that period felt very rushed until the day I had to depart. I would not want to re-live those challenging days again. Our farewell was terrible and we both were crushed. Since then we are in LDR. Now back home, I get flashbacks of our last days and the airport scene. These have increased recently. Whenever I think of it, I end up breaking down.

My dreams are also recurrent and I always get dreams where I am visiting that country and rushing to meet my partner or my family has come to take me back home and I am spending my last days and trying to make most out of my last days before I depart. Dreams, where I am on my way to the airport and my partner is chasing after to say goodbye one last time.

Since these dreams, I have become more disturbed and crying a lot. Those last days are constantly in my mind and I'm becoming somewhat clingy too. These constant separation flashbacks are hurting me a lot.

I can see the benefit as them thinking I am indebted to them, glorifying/sanctifying themselves, or just to get me ""functional"" so I can be used again. So sometimes ""help"" makes me feel dehumanized. Like I may as well be an annoying broken object, only offered ""help"" to enable more use and benefit.

TLDR: How have you experienced trauma invalidation based on a perceptive identity?

\*For my safety I will redact identifying information 

———&gt; BEGIN MESSAGE AND CONTEXT

*“Hello! I hope everything is going well in regards to administrative processes and summer vacations during this time. We deserve a break after all the craziness.* 

*Unfortunately, I am not here writing about how I may have discovered lottery algorithms or how I have pet a really cool unicorn named Frank. (Lightening the mood here).* 

*I am writing about the unfortunate occurrences that have taken place on \[REDACTED\]’s campus throughout my freshman year and I find it imperative that our policies and administrative culture need to incorporate change in order to best support and retain our students with a TRUE \[REDACTED\] initiative. I want to be as open as possible because it has come to my attention that students are not feeling safe on campus regarding aspects of racial ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other backgrounds.* 

*When I first walked onto \[REDACTED\]’s campus in 2017 for \[REDACTED\] camp, I felt nothing but love and support from my coaches and the other staff we had interaction with. I felt as if I could be myself and have a voice for what I believed in even though I was going through incredible hardship.* 

*Unfortunately in 2019 walking on as an incoming freshman, that perspective ultimately changed. I was initially welcomed with love and respect, which slowly transitioned into witnessing hate and discrimination from both students and faculty (far from God’s moral expectation).*

***Regarding sexual orientation:*** 

*1) Though I am heterosexual woman* ***\[LIE BUT I CANNOT EXPRESS OTHERWISE FACING EXPULSION\]****, I was asked to leave my dorm and was made extremely uncomfortable by another student who perceived me as a lesbian despite me never making an attempt to be perceived as such. I went along with it. This student brought me into her dorm with an off-campus friend and proceeded to ask me to give her friend relationship advice since I was “gay” and that she was a “God loving Christian” and couldn’t do so herself. On ZERO campus should an individual be sought out for their sexual orientation whether it be accurate or not. I shrugged this situation of ignorance off believing that it was one of a kind and that it would not happen again. I didn’t take this as a personal attack, but I did question the kind of culture that was supported on campus. My instance has not been the only instance and I have learned that the specific term for this on \[REDACTED\]’s campus is called “witch hunting” in simpler terms, it is bullying. Our students regardless of their sexual orientation, should be able to worship with their peers* ***without*** *fear that they would be targeted. God loves all of his children, and individuals should not live in* ***fear*** *when mixing their orientations with faith and the word of God. Similar actions have prevented students from staying on \[REDACTED\]’s campus.* 

*2) On the first snow, many cars were vandalized with the words “f\*g” or “f\*\*\*\*\*t” written on windshields. Though it may seem like an innocent prank - it has the ability to make individuals feel uncomfortable and concerned in means to their safety. I understand that students will be students, but this behavior is extremely inappropriate. This does not support God’s word upon the judgement of others.* 

***Regarding the culture surrounding sexual assault:*** 

*An old and outdated \[REDACTED\] policy was presented to me the first week on campus that female students out of wedlock who became pregnant, would not be allowed to partake in educational activities on campus. It is my understanding now that this has changed to be more inclusive (an incredible step). It has also come to my attention out of both personal and non-personal experiences that there is a stigmatization upon sexual assault on campus. I was told that if I was caught on campus in any sexually suggestive situation I would be punished no matter if it was consensual or not. Our students should not fear potential backlash from administrators and staff when it comes to reporting their abusers. Unfortunately, I was sexually and physically assaulted on campus in September. I was unable to get the support that I needed, therefore I never filed a report including his name. Still, I was harassed by my abuser and his associating team alike coaches included. I attempted to reach out to mental health services on campus only to be told that they were booked out for weeks. I eventually denied campus support in light and word of potential HIPPA violations that may or may not have occurred this past year. I feared for my safety.* 

***NOTE FOR REDDIT:*** *The University has a history of breaking HIPPA and being sued.* 

***Regarding racial discrimination:*** 

***1) It needs to be made CLEAR that racial discrimination will not be supported on \[REDACTED\]’s campus. It is NOT a personality trait and it shouldn’t be embedded within our teams. (An entire team was involved in this).*** 

*I will let it be known that I was recorded in \[REDACTED\] communicating with a student of color. The student was a very kind gentleman and did not have any intentions beyond academia. This video was sent to my significant other who was told “Once she goes black she never goes back” on top of the student I was communicating with, being repeatedly called racial slurs. I reported it to one of my professors (who will remain unnamed) and nothing was done about it. I leave these notations unnamed because this is a cultural issue and needs to be communicated about on a broader spectrum.*

***Regarding professors judging the career paths of students:*** 

***1) After I complete my degree at \[REDACTED\], I intend to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer. UNFORTUNATELY, I am deterred from this dream daily due to the interactions with my professors.*** 

*If I have not understood something, I have been told to figure it out instead of being supported through the difficulty I was having because I “want to be a lawyer”. If I joke about papers being lengthy, I am told “I have no sympathy for you, you’re going to be a lawyer.” I have been told by professors that by the way I do things, I will “never make it”. Professors need to be supportive of other majors- especially when it comes to general education requirements.* 

*These are all reasons why students have left \[REDACTED\]. These are also reasons why our prospective students wind up declining our offers (breaking my heart). We cannot continue to scare students away making them feel unloved and unwelcome. \[REDACTED\] should not and should never be a representation of hate. \[REDACTED\] is a school that I love and I want to be apart of, but things like this make it difficult. If you are willing to take this conversation with me, I will more than appreciate it. This is a conversation that needs to happen.”*

——-&gt; END MESSAGE 

EXPLANATION: I wrote this email for self explanatory reasons as you have read. This email also came from experiences a former close friend and I individually faced. 

I will not put put identifying information of the individual’s traumas - but they were incredibly rough given the email.

I had a phone call with the former friend stating that in confrontation of this email, I had a sit down meeting / conversation with the president of the University leading to a LOT of overwhelming positive change. (R/celebrate)

They appreciated the effort - but straight up told me that I did not have the agency to have this conversation (even though it consisted of **my** on campus traumas) due to the fact that I am a “straight passing white woman in a straight relationship”. I have an incredible amount of personal trauma. This includes S/A, my sexuality, abuse, situational trauma, health trauma, racial trauma - you name it. Yet because I do not fit the physical or socioeconomic picture of having these traumas - they are seemingly not existent and or invalid because it (based on perception and minimal detail provided) “could be worse”. 

\*\*\* I will not provide specific trauma information / severity, I do not need to subject myself nor others. \*\*\* Do not compare.

This presents the TLDR question: 

TLDR: How have you experienced trauma invalidation based on a perceptive identity? 

IE: (person a experienced x) (person b also experienced x) yet because (person b -&gt; looks or comes from y) (person a had it worse and you shouldn’t vocalize)

976,is_reddit_useful,1613587786,"Thinking about my own experiences and observations of my mother, I see a pattern with what others might call depression.

The person lacks skills and habits for expressing some of their drives into constructive action. They may have found that attempts to express those only make things worse and given up. Thoughts about those subjects trigger pain and conditioned avoidance relating to trauma.

The person may not even be fully consciously analytically aware of some drives and needs.  That may be blocked as a coping mechanism, or it might even have never been fully developed because they never felt able to explore it.

You could say that this ""giving up"" on expressing drives and fulfilling needs is a kind of depression.

However, people still have other drives and needs, and they keep expressing those. Also, pain regarding things where you seem helpless can be redirected into other behaviours to try to manage one's emotional state. Often such coping is less useful, and it can be addictive.

But the unexpressed stuff doesn't simply disappear. It keeps coming up, even if you're not fully aware of the fact it is happening.

It can lead to ideas like ""Why should I do this other unimportant shit while these major needs remain unfulfilled!?"". Then if you're told to simply go do other unimportant stuff to feel better, without the important stuff being recognized and addressed, that seems light gaslighting. It's trying to get you to again ignore the important stuff and go back to where you were before instead of healing. Using medication to try to help that happen might be more like drug abuse than medicine.

Eventually, ignored important drives can even result in violence. The pressure builds up, and you don't know how to express it constructively, but you can't hold it in.

I guess these patterns can be endless as long as the drive behind them doesn't get recognized and harnessed in a useful way.

Maybe I'm just imagining drama to support the belief that my mother isn't simply a psychopath, and seeking validation of that. But I think I'm seeing something real.

I don't know if depression is often like this, and not only for those who experienced severe neglect and/or abuse.  Maybe society is traumatizing for everyone, and it's just that some people are traumatized in a more useful and functional way. But I don't want to go into this.

979,Cheshirekitty22,1613585310,"I hate that she always expects me to be happy to see her and guilts me when she doesn't get her way. She thinks getting the bare minimum of me is good enough as far as conversations go. It's like my opinion or anything I say doesn't matter to her as long as I cooperate. 

The past Christmas I was going to go over my mom's to spend time with her and my brother but she had to get a test for covid (the results wouldn't be in until after Christmas) because one of her co-workers was positive and was working when she also was. I then wasn't going to, and my mom thought it would be good for her to stay at her boyfriend's place while I hang out with my brother(she hadn't been around for at least a few days do her house would be ok). I agreed with my boyfriend also agreeing (he's transportation because I don't drive yet). And everything is good and all that. She then decided to show up unannounced and gives us presents and dinner that she prepared. So the damage has already been done at this point and so I also exchange gifts. I am furious and distraught because I couldn't trust her to just keep us safe by staying away. 

I explained my frustrations as clearly as possible a few days later(after she got her results and they were negative) because I just couldn't let this pass. 
I explain I'm hurt, I'm angry, and that her actions were very irresponsible as a parent. Instead I got something along the lines of that I'm wrong and i need to grow up and that its disrespectful to speak to her that way. Things between me and her were already pretty rocky, so this was the tipping point for me. 

She wonders why I don't react happily to see her anymore. Why i don't text her. Why I don't talk to her. Like, you don't want to be a parent anymore? Fine, I will just not try to associate myself with you anymore. I'm so sick of her shit. It's always the same stuff. But she refuses to change anything. I can only support her for so long before I decide enough is enough and I've long reached that point. She can't be supportive of me anyway. 

I found out sometime recently that she brought up a past trauma of mine(she slammed my head against the wall around age 12 repeatedly for lying about my progress report and hiding it because I was scared of getting bad grades), that she caused, to my brother in conversation and didn't reveal all the details. 
When I decided randomly on my own to tell him about it(I trust him enough), he seemed surprised and said ""Oh, so thats what happened"". And my brother asked her about it all and apparently she got upset. Like excuse me? 

On top of which she has some serious addiction issues and I've helped financially a LOT in the past and never gotten any cent back. I had to lie a lot to get her to stop asking for money to support her addiction. I've managed to get her to go get help, but I think she quit going and never mentioned it to anyone.

983,throwaway6627732,1613584137,"This is one of the hardest and most painful things I've ever had to do. I just broke up with my partner of five years. 

He was my best friend and felt like my soulmate. We could talk for hours about anything. He made me laugh. He accepted my mental health challenges. He loved me dearly and deeply. We had so many shared hobbies and interests.

But he couldn't address my needs. Any time I brought up an issue, he'd get defensive, blame me for bringing it up, and we'd circle the drain for hours in confusing meta-conversations about how it made *him* feel bad that *my* needs weren't being met. Or he'd promise me all starry-eyed that he'd address it because he cares about me and loves me so much, but then he wouldn't take any action at all. Rinse and repeat.

The relationship reminded me so much of childhood. That feeling that unconditional love is there, just beyond the reach of my fingertips, *if only I could stop having needs*. The relationship is perfect, the other person is perfect, the only problem is that I have needs.

I spent years trying to shut off my feelings. I walked on eggshells around him. I didn't bring up issues. I wrote letters to myself begging myself to stop caring about finances, sex, long-term planning, kids, domestic tasks, communication, boundaries. I told myself that if I could just accept whatever he gave to me, it would be enough. His love would be enough, and I'd never be alone again.

But I couldn't shut off the part of me that wanted more, and he could not give me more. So I left.

He is telling me I'll regret this. That he would have loved me for the rest of my life. I still can't really believe that I'm choosing my own boundaries and needs over someone who loves me, when all I've ever wanted is to be loved.

I'm hoping this is a positive step towards my recovery, and that next time I will leave the first time it becomes clear someone is incapable of respecting boundaries and responding to needs, instead of 5 years down the line.

Oh, what do you know? I had one last night! Okay, so I don’t know why this happens to me, but I swear it’s come from so much stress lately. A few months ago, I started to wake up feeling as though there was a bucking bronco in my chest going wild, and would take several minutes for it to finally calm down enough to either go back to sleep, or that I didn’t feel an overwhelming urge to call for help. These kinds of nights went away after a while, but I really hope this doesn't mean they're coming back...

I don’t remember what the dreams were about since they were forever ago, but last night, all I could remember was the suffocating feeling of being sat on.

I wonder if this has something to do with my past where there were times bullies in school would try to sit on me (just because I was short and they were assholes. “Oh, hur hur, I didn’t see you there!” and all that jazz…) and I’d have to fight them off. Maybe it’s a fear of catching Covid-19 and not being able to breathe as a result. I do have a form of asthma, so I’m at a higher risk. I, honestly, don’t know which.

I don’t have panic attacks often, so I wonder if something else is that I’m having them in my sleep. That’d be when I least suspect them.

Don't be mistaken, my ptsd is not cured. I did respond to her, um, ""persistence"" with some cocktail of freeze/fawn. I gave up on restating my boundaries pretty quickly. I did what she wanted and pretended to enjoy it. I got high so it wouldn't be so scary. It sucked. That's an understatement. 

But I'm... ok? 

Alright, I was in shambles for about a week. I hardly got out of bed, hardly ate, hardly spoke to anyone. Cried and cried and cried. And cried some more. 

But I'm... ok. 

Because I've got years of trauma processing and recovery under my belt, and skills. And when I was done crying I wiped my eyes and used those skills. I confided in a trusted friend. I talked it through with my therapist. I made a safety plan, and a backup safety plan. I stopped myself from ruminating and reliving. I was gentle and kind to myself. I let myself see the assault for what it was: a horrible violation, but also in the past. 

Do I still feel that white hot tension in my chest when I think about what happened? Oh yeah. Can I look my assailant in the eyes? Hell no. Is it hard to talk about? Incredibly. Do I still doubt, minimize, and blame myself? Sometimes. But I'm not having flashbacks or nightmares or increased hyper-vigilance, and this event hasn't burrowed itself into my sex life. I can eat and sleep and enjoy myself from time to time. 

So, was this event a trauma? I'd say so. Did I develop trauma symptoms around it? Hardly. I'm... ok.

I'm sharing this just to say there is hope. I used to think if I ever suffered another trauma my heart would just give out. I would just die, right there on the spot. There'd be no way I could handle it. 

And here I am. Doing ok. 

I don't want anyone to interpret this to mean that someone can or should be able to prevent ptsd. You can have a robust support system and an arsenal of skills and still get **rocked** by trauma.

But I've now seen for myself that healing is real. Obviously I'm not cured, or else I would have screamed or kicked or run away the very moment she crossed a line. Symptoms from all my previous traumas still come up day-to-day. But as for this particular event... I'm ok.

She used to be super unavailable to me emotionally as I was growing up. Now she's trying to establish a relationship with me, but I'm thinking in a rather peculiar way.

She is bothered by my relationship with my dad, which has always been much stronger than I've ever had with her. She actually told me a couple of years back that ""she just knew when I was born that I would always come first to my dad.""

She is actually really irrational about always finding the new health trend and she is painstakingly always commenting on something health related. For example she is like really really keen on tooth health. She will always comment on different toothpastes and making sure I'm using a fluorided one continuously(which I didn't at one point to try it out, but anyway).

He has since sort of apologized but I feel very at odds with his apology, since he seems to not understand why what he did traumatized me. The Larry Nassar story was the first time I was able to identify/analyze that what happened to me was deeply inappropriate and abuse, and I think my realization also came with age. I have never in my life thought the way he touched us would be appropriate behavior with a child or an adult.  It terrifies me I didn’t remember it at all until I was older—sometimes I think I must be completely insane and I have the mental health history to almost support it, which both my parents have weaponized against me
multiple times. I am doing so much work on myself to heal and will be forever. It’s an incredible weight to carry and it’s invisible. My mom doesn’t seem to understand why it bothers me so much either. She didn’t know about when it was happening as he chose to do it when she was working or away but her response after I told her in adulthood was... not surprising since she was physically and emotionally abusive to us as children and seems to lack the same awareness as an adult. The whole lack of awareness thing is absolutely terrifying—but not surprising, in my family. I feel like I suffer from lethal shame just by being their relative. Whether or not I have caused someone harm I apologize obsessively, can’t let it go, think I am a terrible and awful person, even though I am neither of my parents. 

He stopped once I matured into a teenager but groped us with our clothes on, until we told him to stop after telling our mom. Otherwise he was a very involved father: he could be extremely loving and also extremely overbearing, a perfectionist about academics. He is very nerdy and awkward and kind of makes a point out of is worrying bad guys—like if a sexual abuser is on TV in the news he’ll swear and shake his head. But he doesn’t see how his own behavior was...literally the same? It’s very hard to write that. 

He pushed us to choose his career and interests, and my mom kind of lived through our successes. My sister is much quieter about what happened—I don’t think anyone in her life knows. People certainly look at me sideways for wanting to reunite with these people, but I do love them, and it is just so much more complicated than I can express. I felt like there’s really no way to win in my situation—judged for estrangement, judged for staying. Trapped. Hopeless—the recurring fear my sister and me were not the only children he harmed, that there could be others but I have no proof nor way of knowing. 

My family is severely dysfunctional for other reasons not related to this but I am going to be focusing on it at our next family therapy session, something I asked we all do, and I’m very scared to address it. I want to move past it but when I’ve brought it up in the past he usually defaults to tears, apologizing for how I feel about it, claiming he never meant to hurt us, that it was not “a sexual thing” for him. I desperately want to believe that but I keep coming back to what happened and shit doesn’t add up. It is so traumatizing and I don’t know why I keep putting myself through it. And it reactivates the worst parts of my illness when I do that. It’s really just self-sabotage.

My mom records me crying and saying I want to die when I have flashbacks or get triggered for “proof” and is threatening to throw me in the mental hospital and long term care facilities again involuntarily which she has before because she’s sick of me getting flashbacks and hearing me cry and I would 100% go to just get out of the situation but mental hospitals are very triggering for me because of the times I have been previously admitted she would make me take 6 Benadryl before so she could get me in the car to drop me off and the doctors usually wind up putting me on so many medications that I wind up being like a zombie also the loud noises scare me I’m terrified of hospitals 

I’m disabled from mental illness caused by the abuse and have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 7 and I qualify for ssi benefits and section 8 housing but apparently it takes up to a year to get them if I would even get them. I don’t have money for an attorney. 

I can’t live with her anymore I can’t sleep I can’t eat I don’t remember the last time I brushed my teeth or took a shower all I do is stay in my 10x10 room pacing and trying to distract myself from flashbacks. I don’t leave my room cause being around my mom is too much to handle. 

She takes me to my doctors appointments, has control of all of my medications (im on a handful of stuff that has horrible to deadly withdrawals if I cold Turkey them), she set up all of my patient portal accounts so I don’t know the passwords and can’t tell my doctors what’s going on, and has all of the paperwork to all of my medical records.

I’ve just now gotten to the point with my therapist where I can get her to tell my mom to leave the room so I can try to tell them everything that went on so I don’t get another wrong diagnosis. But now she says she’s not going to take me to therapy anymore. She doesn’t want to feel guilty about everything so she doesn’t want me telling anyone about anything.

1011,Ltrfsn,1613477366,"The trauma is nothing compared to what I read of other people on this sub so I'm sorry if the banality of my ""trauma"" comes across as insulting. It has affected me profoundly.

In childhood I was neglected and my parents wouldn't defend me. This lead to my problem with intimacy and a feeling of inferiority. I was bullied so I started out my teenage years in a medium severe depression. As I biologically developed I started being interested in girls. I knew how to talk to them, up to a certain point. When the tension is there, the looks are exchanged and these ""signs"" are given where in movies the boy kisses the girl, I was suffering extreme discomfort because of my problems with intimacy. Because I was so inexperienced I would defuse the situation. Perhaps I gave the girls the impression I was nothing more than a friend because of this, I don't know. Now I was gradually becoming more and more depressed as time progressed. Girls I had a crush on would end up having sex with other boys, sometimes my own friend. One girl ended up being my girlfriend (she kissed me) and she lost her virginity to my then best friend regardless. Then it happened. I fell completely and utterly in love with this girl. In hindsight, I became obsessed and delusional. I had an on and off interaction with this girl. Mind you I'm fully depressed at this point and not behaving normally because of what I would later find out was a personality disorder. I was deeply in love, but now in hindsight I can tell she has daddy issues. She'd sit on guys knees to make me jealous, kiss other guys and tell me about it. We had a date where she put her head on my shoulder. I wanted to kiss her but I just couldn't because the feeling was killing me, this intimacy problem froze me. Later she would text me angrily that I should have kissed her. At some point she got a boyfriend. Because I was already in the beginning of becoming a stalker I started talking to him. He told me he took her virginity and my teenage brain crashed down. I wanted to commit suicide over something you grown up reader might find ridiculous and unimportant. I grew up with thinking it is an important thing, and as I am a virgin still I can't completely get rid of the feeling associated with it. Regardless, I acted crazy then towards her and drove her away even more. She told me she would be mine if I beat him up after they had some falling out, so I did it (also to feel better about myself, which didn't really happen). The next day we had a ""date"". She asked me what ""I want you to fuck me"" was in a different language and I just answered and couldn't act on the hint. I couldn't go through this barrier of anxiety caused by my problem with intimacy. Later she got a boyfriend with whom she had her sexual exploration with, becoming the woman she is now and this time she told me ""she came so hard on his cock she couldn't walk straight"". Mind you next to this I was already depressed because of other things in life and this traumatic experience pushed me over. I wanted to kill myself. I mutilated myself during this, but for some reason even though my behaviour was becoming more deranged I was still obsessed with her (what I thought was love). My extreme behaviour caused her to cut off all ties with me and I ended up cyberstalking her and harassing her for years until she called the cops. I was then tried and convicted and did municipal labour. Just before and after I had my two most likely to succeed suicide attempts. I got mandatory forensic therapy which has been the saving of my life as I finally learned how all these things were my personality disorder and how I can deal with the emotions that I had no control over. One could say it's too late as I'm now 30, burned all my bridges down in my madness and have no friends or experience with girls and am still a virgin. I have no job and live with my parents. I had to make a burner account to sext with an anonymous redditors and on that account, because it wasn't blocked, I was recommended that girls Instagram. Seeing how she's grown up and has a life did something with me. Luckily I now have the tools to deal with that. My curiosity however led me to look at more of it, and in it I see her sexual preferences towards tougher sex which surprised me. Furthermore she posted she was raped long ago when I still knew her and for the first time I put one and two together and realised this guy I hit must have been the rapist, explaining why she said I should beat him. Having frequented the rapekink subreddit I always wondered at how that kind of trauma has led to victims being extremely aroused by it (at least the way they describe their stories). It makes sense for trauma to become treated physiologically through sexual arousal. After having lost so many girls to other men while having felt inferior and depressed I now recently discovered I feel aroused at the idea of cuckolding. It's still very confusing and embarrassing to me, but it also arouses me in a different part of my brain that the usual arousal. I don't like being like this but I can't help biology. However what I was not prepared for was the idea that while I was continuously rejected by her she was raped and could have either liked it or developed a fetish out of it.

So I medium key struggled with alcohol abuse. But there were a few times in my life when I absolutely regressed and had no memory of it, woke up and was back to normal after drinking. 

The first time, I was with some guy, and the day after he pulled me aside and mentioned it. I didn’t understand at that time..I was guessing but I denied it although it was crazy specific. 

The second time. a couple of years back, I got smashed with a friend. I thought, well I’m going to get litty, grow a few back blast some music and talk. All I remember is waking up, back to normal..time to clean, shower eat, continue the trip all proud of myself thinking I was baller af, no. This girl I assumed I partied hard with gave me an entire breakdown that night. Apparently I was at age 3-6 the entire time and I’m not going into details about how I spoken or whatever. My soul just seizes into a cringe. It’s bothered me for so long. I thanked her but ended the contact because well reasons related to the mechanics of that friendship.

So now, I look back at all the experiences I’ve had in the past.. I’m just mortified. For superficial reasons, I’m kinda pissed that I can’t party or really drink without possibly regressing. I’m happy I skipped on clubbing though. How embarrassing Jesus, that’s legit the only emotion I’m feeling right now. Part of me wants to just record myself when I drink, but I don’t have the balls to do it.

my psychiatrist has been scheduling appointments in the early morning, almost before office hours. usually there's no one but me and her in the office, as her nurses and assistants haven't arrived by the time i get there. she leaves the door to her room open, but i'm still extremely uncomfortable and fearful about being alone there. appointments are only around 15 minutes, long enough for her to prescribe new meds. 

i don't feel able to express my discomfort because my appointments with this psychiatrist are subsidized - i don't pay for them, though i believe my doctor still gets paid. i'm scared of saying something wrong or inconveniencing her with an irrational fear, especially since i'm lucky enough to be able to see a psychiatrist at all. she is absolutely kind and just wants to help, it's nothing to do with her as a doctor. 

i have a history of CSA / trafficking and i think being alone with someone in this way triggers the shit out of me and makes me shut down. i don't know how to raise this issue or if it's even worth raising, when rationally i know i'm not in any danger and i'm only there to pick up my medication anyway.

I was 4 years old - why would this be even a jokey concern?

I have been with you all for about 2 years, writing my experiences. I wrote my pains, my traumas, my woes on here. It has been the healthiest, least toxic way for me to get this all out.. You have all been so supportive to me. This and the CPTSDFightMode sub had helped a lot. 

I dont know what to say.. The detective I talked to thought I was a liar. One of my triggers is people not believing me, so I shut down. My dad would grill me for hours and tell me I was a liar over and over again, so having a police man question everything about me was triggering... it's an authority figure....!!

Things he said to me: 
1. ""I think you just really like attention and dont know it.""

2. ""I looked on your moms instagram and you look like one big, ...happy.. family. why were you smiling in all these photos??""

3. He asked me to name one thing I like about each family member. I said my youngest brother was artistic. Middle brother was brave. I told him I didnt really like my mom and I guess she's nice sometimes. When he asked about my dad, I told him that I didnt have anything nice to say about him and I hate him. 

Because of this, he thought I was vindictive and trying to ruin my dads life. Like, not everyone LIKES THEIR FAMILY. ESPECIALLY FAMILY IVE BEEN ESTRANGED FROM FOR 2 YEARS BY MY CHOICE. WHAT DID HE THINK I WAS GONNA LOVE THEM??????!!??!

4. (I had a timeline and list of memories. There were like 15 and they were the huge, traumatic ones.. So I made a brief synopsis of each one and I would refer to it for each memory so I could keep my facts straight)
*him looking at me suspiciously* ""why do you need that?????""
*I explained*
""Ok................""

5. (Hed ask me what happened before and after memories. WHY was your dad mad? Why did your dad throw you above his head? What happened before and after?... &gt;&gt;&gt;I couldnt give him exact details and told him that I didnt even like to go back to the flashes of memory. I've never sat and thought about what happened before and after. I didn't think that was important. ) 
Officer: ""Bitemebitch00, I'm going to be straight up with you. I have little girls from the age of 7 to old women come in here. They can all tell me what happened before... and after. And you cant. Now what does that tell me?""

6. He told me my memories weren't real. I have a memory of trying to get away from my dad on the platform at church when he continually tried to hug me in front of people. And then I had a memory around a similar time where my dad pulled me onto his lap to cuddle me when I was 18 and then shoved me off his lap onto the floor when my mom walked in. MEMORIES I REMEMBER VERY WELL. 

Officer: ""In this memory you want to get away from him? But in this memory you let him cuddle him. Bitemebitch00, these dont make sense. They both cant be real..""
Me: ""Well, they are..""
Officer: ""so you want him away from you and then in this memory you let him near you???
Me: ""I mean I hated him but hes my dad and like I loved him..""

7. Officer: ""You called CPS at the beginning of the year and your story doesn't match up. You said your brothers weren't sexually assaulted. Now you're saying they were?"" 
Me: ""Yes, I had new memories come back. I know I sound crazy.. but I didnt know what I do now..""

8. I had reported an assault at my last job where a customer hit me for not having an item. I told security and then pressed charges and made a police report. Security told me they couldnt get video of it because it was during a huge renovation and lights were shining directly at the camera. I didnt hear back from the cops and I was assuming that's why.

Officer: ""I know about the assault at your job.""
Me: ""what about it?""
Officer: ""I know why they dropped it.""
Me: ""yeah the lights were in the camera so they couldnt do anything""
Officer: ""no. They looked at the cameras and you weren't anywhere near where you said you were and there was no one near you!""

9. ""Bitemebitch00, I'm gonna be honest with you. The defense attorney would be asking you a lot more pointed questions and frankly hed make you look dumb.""

10. Officer: ""so if I ask your brother about the sexual assault that will happen to him,what will he say?""
Me: ""honestly I dont know if he'll remember.""
Officer: ""you guys are like the same age. Why wouldn't he remember???""
Me: ""I just had these memories resurface this past year. Like JUST recently. Like I remember walking in on it happening but this is a very recent development.""

11. Officer: ""I know about the suicide calls to your work that your therapist sent""
Me: ""ok..?

12. My brother (that I haven't seen or talked to in 2 years that I used to be close with) told the cops that he thought I was depressed and mentall off. Like mentally ill.. So the officer stopped investigating. I tried to give him another lead. A daycare kid that my brother (THIS ONE IM TALKING ABOUT) had perform oral sex on him when were both little kids.

1024,jaackjaack,1613459538,"This is about family trauma, I couldn’t pick the other flair so just want to state the trigger warning. 

My parents separated when I was 17, to keep this story simple, essentially my mom left. She met my stepdad in the 90s and he’s been supporting us every since when she already had 2 kids from my biological dad. 

She’s the toxic kind of mother  (had me very young, immature mindset, no maternal instinct, resentful, jealous). Looking back now, I grew up with huge attachment issues, that brought on all sorts of others. I was vastly insecure, hurt my friends, lashed out, couldn’t process my feelings, and generally had very unhealthy mental health growing up that led to bad friends, bad choices. 

She left to go live with her secret boyfriend she was lying to me about to raise his kid, after leaving her 3 kids here (age range 9-17). My stepdad got a place for him and my youngest (half) brother, we have a fantastic relationship and see him all the time and consider him my father. 

Since, my biological parents (dad came back into the picture to talk shit about my mom leaving l m a o) sent money since for rent and food. I graduated high school with her already being gone, and had to take care of my middle younger (full) brother for 2 years while he finished high school (also going through this own grief which I didn’t even help him handle and feel terrible about) and another year while he moved out. He’s had to come back to live for a couple months at a time and was very abusive and lashed out but is better now, however I still don’t have contact with him. 

With my undergrad, I wasn’t ever sure on my major. It was a pick on a whim because I truly did not have the skills to ask myself who I was and what I wanted so I picked what sounded good. I was constantly angry, defensive, and exhausted. I’ve since finished my undergrad (took 7 fucking years), and didn’t even get to truly experience it because it was too much to deal with. I made bad friends, and no regulatory system to process negative feelings so it became a spiral. 
I feel like I’ve wasted so much time, opportunities, and am so lost in my career path as a young adult. I feel robbed and am resentful that I lost such an important part of my life and my dreams to having to deal with my parents incompetence and overall lack of care. 

I just needed it out in the world. If anyones story relates at all, please let me know! I’d really appreciate it. I know this post is long and kind of a bummer, but I’m trying to learn how to navigate these circumstances and would like to meet people going through anything similar.

Now normally without the factors of interrupting my action and dangerous hot oven, that wouldn't be much of an issue. It's intended to be a playful push and considering that our sink is in the corner right next to the oven it was a tiny push.

But I instantly felt tension in my leg and had a flight response... I went to the bathroom and returned to tell my husband that I have a new rule about not trying to move me while those two factors are in play.

I don't even know if this response is over the top for trauma. I don't know how to deal with the after effects either.

My partner seemed annoyed with me on Valentine’s morning, and all of our plans that day involved friends of his. I felt like the third wheel, but I held in my feelings in because again, I thought he was annoyed with me already (I am anxious-avoidant). He kept asking what was wrong, but I was too afraid to be direct. By the time I finally expressed myself that night, he felt unappreciated and exhausted. His empathy had run out.

During the argument he went quiet, and when I looked I realized he was asleep. For some reason this kicked off the abandonment panic and I had to leave the room to go “endure” that feeling. It was intense and took me back to a place I haven’t been in a long time. I felt emotionally exhausted the next day, and have been thinking about the many poor decisions I made that day and bracing myself for something bad to happen since.

One of the neighbors refers to herself as the ""mom"" of the apartment, she's in her fifties and checks in on a lot of the younger neighbors, which is appreciated, although a lot of her ""checking in"" turns into her telling you about how hard her life has been to say that comparatively you don't have it so bad (although, she doesn't actually know that because she doesn't know the first thing about my life). 

One of the other neighbors has attempted suicide twice, and the mom-neighbor checks in on her a lot because of this. I think she was the one who called the paramedics during the last attempt, because the neighbor wasn't responding or answering the door. Which is of course a very generous and kind-hearted thing to do. 

I told myself I wouldn't let myself be suicidal again, but I can't control the amount of social ostracism and rejection I face, so here I am again. The mom-neighbor noticed I wasn't doing well and tried to talk to me. I generally don't open up to people in person because it always ends badly, but like an idiot I told her part of what was going on. After telling me that I just need to ""get on Tinder for a good fuck"" and how much worse her life is than mine, she said that I needed to promise not to kill myself because she doesn't want to deal with a second one of you (the first being the other suicidal neighbor). 

Even with the people who claim they want to help I'm second best. Even the people who reach out to me turn around and treat me like I'm a burden. I didn't fucking ask this woman to reach out. I don't need yet more advice from someone who doesn't know the first thing about me and isn't bothering to learn.

I know exactly what I need, and what I need is human connection, genuine human connection, not a Tinder fuck or canned advice from some self-help book or a neighbor who really wants both to feel good about herself from having ""reached out"" and also wants the catharsis from telling you she has it worse.

A bad airbnb review from 6 years ago I read for the first time and don't understand – hours. Hours wasted because my family used to shame me for everything, and the idea that I did something wrong in someone's house is very triggering. Makes me feel like a terrible, incompetent person. Had to paint about it, write about it, do some thought stopping. Eventually was able to let it go a little bit.

And then stuff my niece did came back to me and suddenly I felt the need to process that. Started writing about it and connected dots I didn't know even know were there. Realizing: she got that information from my mother, then told my friend, ruining our friendship, leaving me even less able to trust anyone, leading to more isolation. This is why I pushed everyone who was nice to me away. It never ends, it all starts and ends with my family. and most of all my mother.

I don't think I can ever see these people again – not just my mother, my niece, my sister, everyone.

Made a post about that. Started writing that post... about 6 hours ago. Oooh that is too long, that is too much time, that can't be healthy. I took a few breaks, but mostly couldn't stop. The post is so long and I'm too afraid no one will read it when what I need is to be heard. To talk and take breaks to cry and process, to see a kind face, to hear the validation. But maybe that'll never come.

And I know processing isn't always a waste of time. And obsessing about an airbnb review is, but learning to deal with a trigger isn't.

Still. It's a lot of time. If it's about 8 hours total, that is too much time.

And now it's time to go to bed, and I'm looking at my day, and my god. I did some chores, I got some stuff done, then I distracted myself with tv for a bit – but other than that, I didn't live. I just lived in the past, instead.

Most families teach their kids through giving them some types of chores, etc, so that’s fine. But it was always the “grossest”/dirtiest/least desired chores he would give us. He’d often talk about how gross the dishes (or whatever we were cleaning) were and it always felt heavily implied that we were too. He was/is a very big and bulky man and towered over us as kids, and he always hovered around like a prison warden. I always felt so small comparatively, and so anxious. He always was watching and it felt like my whole self was being scrutinized or perceived in some dirty, pathetic way.

Because of this I feel extremely humiliated whenever I do chores in front of people. I’ll be fine doing them with I know nobody is around, but the second somebody else I know even glances at me or is nearby, I either can’t do the chore anymore or I feel ashamed and body-anxious the whole time doing it.

Even today, it was my aunt’s birthday (who’s the only person who hasn’t been horribly abusive towards me in the family) and she asked if I could stop at Taco Bell after work and pick her something up so she didn’t have to cook dinner on her birthday. I said sure since I had a free reward to use and it wasn’t gonna be that far out of my way. I told her I would use the free reward and get her a burrito. 

Then two minutes after I already picked up the order she texts me this long order that’s probably at least $20 worth for her and her boyfriend, expecting me to use my free reward AND buy her all that. I told her I already left and that I was sorry but I was trying to focus on the road because it’s icy out, and she got angry with me and shamed me saying “well a burrito isn’t enough so I’m still gonna have to cook.”

Meanwhile on my birthday she got me nothing and actually made me cry. I was supposed to stay overnight at her house and I was crying so hard that I chose to drive an hour away and sleep at a friend’s instead. Then I had to be the first one to apologize to her and her excuse for being a b**ch all day was because she was getting her period. 

But now because I didn’t get her a big enough meal I’m the bad guy? She didn’t even thank me when I dropped off the food. Just ignored me and mumbled something angrily. 

Like I truly don’t get why people treat me this way? I just worked 12 hours and drove out of my way (albeit a little) on icy roads to get her food and she’s angry at me because it “wasn’t enough”, but she makes me cry myself to sleep on my birthday and I’m supposed to get over it?

Long story short, he has been tormenting me since 2016.  Over the years I kept taking him back, believing he was capable of change and that I could just forgive and forget.  I was ultimately wrong.  I am safe now.  

A month after I married him, he was drunk and delusional, saying that he had healing powers from Jesus to fix my deteriorating spine and joints.  I am disabled permanently and suffer nonstop.  He said that I didn’t seem to believe him and that I was behaving negatively.  I could feel the tension building as he started screaming.  Even our dogs were scared and ran away to hide. He then threw a dish of salsa at me from across the kitchen table.  I became nervous and got out of my chair and walked over to the couch because I was scared.  He continued to rant about how I wasn’t a strong enough believer.  So he slapped me extremely hard across the face and then kicked me across the left side of my head while I was seated on the couch.  I was in so much pain that I took a bunch of gabapentin.  I went into the bathroom and locked the door and called 911. 

When the police arrived, I told them what he did.  My “husband” immediately was able to snap out of his delusional ranting abuser mode and behave like a normal person in front of the police.  He told them I was suicidal and making everything up to avoid admitting that I took too much medication.  The paramedics came and took me to the local hospital.  There was no repercussion for what he did to me.  The police bought his story.

I'm still quite young, and I have gone through many bad schools and sports I haven't liked, and I have mostly overcame those issues. I've always been the 'smart guy' of the class and never into sports or games, I've been very passive all my childhood, I preferred reading and cognitive activities more than anything, and I've also been overweight, all that is over now, but for some reason everytime I think about lifting weights, doing kalisthenia, going to the gym or doing any strength excercise I get severe anxiety symptoms (also if I think about playing soccer or getting in a fight). My legs get shaky, my heart starts to pound and I just have to avoid or repress thinking about it not to faint, get a severe migraine or a panic attack. The feeling in my bones is of utter fright and horror.

1074,missgrinch74,1613431273,"Short backstory: (bullet pointed to keep it short) 

- My parents divorced when I was young, my Mom told me my Dad cheated, he swears she did (I found a diary given to her by a man with love letters so this is supported). I have and continue to be close with my mom however. 

- I was sexually abused by my Maternal Grandfather (her Dad) for 2 years, my Mom was horrified and supportive when I came out with it. The abuse started at my grandmother funeral - so double trauma.

- Shortly after the abuse started she got cancer and nearly died, she had a cardiac arrest during treatment and had to be moved to an older drug. 

- She attempted suicide by overdose, my Step father (no 1.) at the time came and got me up to deal with it and went to watch TV. I called the ambulance and made her puke the pills. I was 11. 

- My mom and Step father divorced because of his cheating (we found out because the woman scratched his car int he drive way). He painted he rin a bad light and we left with basically nothing. 

- My mom got rid of our dogs and blamed me not taking care of them. 

- I moved schools and got into the wrong crowd, started smoking and staying out late. We were stuggling finanically. 

- She met my 2nd Step Father (SFN2) and this is where it gets complicated. Basiclaly I had confessed I had been ""raped"" by my grandfather to my new friends- my mom heard me say that and said I couldn't say that- because I wasnt penetrated.  She clarified it was sexual abuse. I went back and clarified with my ""friends"" who took it as I was lying about everything. 

- the pissed of ""friends"" came to my house while my step father (who at this point they were just dating) and actually made a bunch of comments. They said they were going to tell my mom I had ""Lied"". Well SFN2 decided he wasn't going to stay. My mom freaked out on me, saying it was my fault. 

- I said to Lie and say it was about drugs. Blame it all on me and she did. SFN2 and she dated further and we moved to be with him. 

- SFN2 was a straight up narcissist. He would make fun of my self harm, he would make comments about my weight. He cheated on my Mom with, literally 7 women. We couldn't leave because he would threaten my Mom with finding her/ getting her fired. I flunked out of A-levels twice because if everything going on. 

- we finally managed to find a way to leave and she wasn't right..  I asked her what was wrong repeatedly but she would have a go at me if I tried to help. 

- I tried to log into my bank account and couldn't access it. A hop and a terrible call to customer service later, that she over heard. She comes in to tell me that she stole money from her work and used my account to do it. I didn't know- and luckily wasn't charged with anything. 

- I stand by her through the trial, I was interviewed by the police. I also was honest to my work about the situation, they forced me to quit. I was blacklisted from having a bank account for 7 years. 

- Since then I have struggled for work I had to make do with a cash card, I had no credit, I couldn't lease my own flat or car. Luckily I moved back to my home country so my credit file didn't follow me and I've gotten those back. 

So, yeah, those are the main points. 

I really struggle with this because we are close and when it's good it's great. We are really close and I do love her. She is and will always be my mom.

It's hard because she also had been great in so many other ways, she completley spoilt me in terms of parties that cost 6000- (before we were broke) or running away to disneyland and many, many experiances and trips... she has been so much of a best friend in lots of other ways... but I dont know.

Hi, I hope this is okay to post here. I've suffered from C-PTSD for about 5 years, being officially diagnosed with the 'complex' bit in 2017. I've made huge amounts of progress, I've fought so hard to make a life for myself, I am in a safe place now. I've done a bit of therapy, enough to make my past make some more sense but I need EMDR for sure, I've had to put that off thanks to COVID since you can only really do that in person (at least in my area) and nobody is taking appointments.

I notice that I am being triggered and I get flashbacks far less frequently these days, but an issue I've always been able to tolerate for the most part has just been getting worse. It's hard to adequately describe what's going on, but I basically feel overwhelming amounts of embarrassment, shame, or regret after literally every single social interaction and every single decision I make. 

It's worse with work related stuff, or when dealing with my responsibilities like calling my insurance company or my pharmacy. I ruminate on things for so long, and sometimes it seems like the only way to stop ruminating on one thing is to start ruminating on the next thing. I feel like I have to experience a certain amount of guilt and shame for these situations I feel like I did something wrong in, even if there's no evidence to imply I did anything bad. If I feel like I've punished myself enough, I can prevent it from happening again and do better. It's to the point where I'm starting to involuntarily repeat really mean things out loud to myself over and over, or even going as far as hitting myself uncontrollably because the embarrassment becomes overwhelming.

1089,Wolfgang997,1613427344,"I went through a pretty horrendous trauma nearly 4 years ago where I had a drugs induced psychotic episode, ended up being pretty much kidnapped and sectioned abroad (tied to a bed), came home to my alcoholic mother being abusive, lost friends and am completely a shell of my former self. Since the trauma I've been on 10 different medications and literally just self medicated for 3 years. However since September I've moved to my dad's away from my mum, quit alcohol and only talk to people I see as proper friends. But I'm no way nearrrrrrr where I want to be. I'm constantly on edge and have head jerks from socialising, watching TV or even daydreaming. I've been to hypnotherapy and the effects only last a day or so and I've told my uni I need to put off my uni work until my head is sorted. 

I've asked on this thread if anyone has recovered and people say they just ""deal with the symptoms"" I really don't think I can go on the rest of my life with these symptoms I'd honestly rather be dead.

1090,speedycat2014,1613427154,"I've been dealing with the diagnosis of CPTSD for over a year and it's been difficult. over the holidays I suggested to my husband that maybe getting something like a Nintendo switch would be good because we could play games and I would have something to occupy myself that wasn't constantly reading news or Reddit.

We got a switch, and one of the first games I picked up was Tetris 99, where you play Tetris against 98 other players. as they clear lines they can send junk to your screen to make your game more difficult, and as you clear lines you can do the same.

I've been limiting myself to playing the game for maybe an hour a day. But I notice every time I play it I get incredibly calm and zen like. Everyone else I talk to, including my husband is adamant that they're terrible at Tetris and they don't even want to try to play it.

Meanwhile, less than a month in and I've already gotten to 2nd place a couple of times in a few games, which is incredibly difficult to do. I have terrible spatial capabilities in the real world but for some reason I am a master at Tetris.

I was feeling so good after a game last night that I decided to Google if Tetris was good for your brain. And this was the article that came up. It seems that I've stumbled onto something helpful for dealing with trauma quite by mistake.

1092,nbianchi,1613426585,"I’m not sure if anyone else does this, but I am finding that it’s easier to use creativity to share my experience and bring awareness to CPTSD as a whole. I often struggle with explaining how I feel, much less educate others close to me about what CPTSD is and how it can affect my daily life or others. I am not a clothing designer at all, but this outlet really helps me process and share my experience. 

As many of us, I also grew up only being able to rely on myself, and in addition, was only diagnosed in my mid thirties with CPTSD. That diagnosis brought immense relief after many years of being misdiagnosed with a variety of other conditions. As such, I have developed this drive to increase awareness of CPTSD in hopes that others will not have to struggle as long as I did. 

The creativity coupled with the drive to bring awareness to CPTSD and other things (like LGBTQ+ issues), has sent me on a path. 

I initially started designing hoodies and other clothes for myself that would serve as conversation starters, allowing me to talk more freely about said subject (like CPTSD). After many of my friends and people on Instagram started asking where I got the designs, and could they buy one, I decided to create small runs of certain designs using a fundraising functionality that the vendor I use provides. More or less, it allows people to buy online over a short period of time to get the amount needed to make a run, and all of the proceeds are donated to an organization of your choosing. 

Thought I’d share my most recent design that is benefitting “Beauty After Bruises” an organization that focuses on outreach to adult survivors of childhood trauma who have Complex PTSD and/or dissociative trauma disorders.

Anyhow, if you’re interested in sharing or buying, putting a link to the fundraiser below, as well as other designs that support a myriad of causes/ organizations like Media Literacy and LGBTQ+ organizations. Please let me know what you think. This is an important outlet for my healing and helps me feel that CPTSD is being recognize and seen.

What is bothering me about the pandemic is how nothing has changed, except I don’t go to work anymore. I had a few friends at work and when that ended, I realized that they were my only real “in person” socialization. Watching everyone struggle to stay connected and recreate their hand out sessions electronically makes me sad. I never had that. I was invited to a few Zoom chats, but being on camera with a group of people I don’t know is terrifying. 

I don’t know how to act with people unless it’s in a scripted type environment (work, school, an activity). I’ve always rationed myself with friends, only contacting them every 2-3 weeks so I don’t bother them. I tend to not ask personal questions because my boundaries were never respected. So, I feel like it’s rude to ask too many questions. But, I think that comes off as disinterested. I try not to talk about myself too much. I try not to talk about depressing or personal things. I try to be funny and helpful. I try not to bother people, but I come off as boring or weird. 

I overthink every sentence and always feel like I did something wrong. And I convince myself that I did and I have to fix it, but the only way to fix it is to be really great next time. I feel like I can’t acknowledge how I messed up or that will be weird. And I can’t contact them again until time has passed. So, I just have to wait, feeling like a failure and that the person I talked to hates me until the next time I can organically try talking to them again. 

And then I hate myself for being self centered enough to think that anyone even thought about the conversation I had with them. People tend to think I am pretty mellow and I have thick skin. It’s the exact opposite, but I am so committed to hiding it that I guess I got good at it over the years. 

I’ve had problems with this since I was a child. I don’t live in a populated area and I wasn’t really allowed to go to friends houses or invite friends over. So, I lost all of my friends over the summer every year as they got closer to other people they could see. I’d have to make new ones at the beginning of every year. It’s still like that and I’m forty. I’m never the friend people keep when they move on to something else. 

It is exhausting and it takes it’s toll. Lately, I just feel like may need to stop wanting a friend connection. I have a partner and maybe that’s all I can have. It’s just lonely.

1108,Totally-Rad-bro,1613420533,"Does anyone else feel like *almost everything* is a limited resource, and that if YOU use it it's a waste? Or get overly protective of food?

These are just going to be a string of thought and examples, sorry if they make no sense or is sorta long.

**I do this with myself and my time:**

If I don't work on freelance work before 6pm during mon-fi I've wasted my week, I feel terrible, I haven't been productive. I'm wasting my life and time I have here.

If I work on the weekend, or don't do something fun for myself, I feel like I've wasted my weekend.

If I'm not helping other people, I feel selfish, and unproductive. I have a hard time working on projects for myself.

**I do this with House hold stuff:**

If I take a shower, I should take it relatively quick so I'm not wasting all the water, or keeping someone from using the bathroom if they need it.

I got 3 bath bombs for Christmas, but feel like I should leave the other 2 for other people to use, or it'd be a waste. 

Growing up I would shower once a week to use less towels, water, and detergent, and give my mom less laundry and water bills, so she wouldn't get mad at me having laundry in the bin.

Growing up I was proud at how much little I could go without, and how money conscience I was for my age.

**I do this with Food, very badly:**

I get upset, and angry when friends and family throw away food, especially if it's a ""safe"" food I or my brothers could have eaten, or leave it out to spoil.

As kids my brothers and I would rush to the lunch room to make sure we could get at least 1 cheese pizza, because we weren't sure if there'd be anything us, or our youngest brother could eat because his diet is restrictive if one of us didn't get pizza before it ran out to give to him.

Eventually this switched to just bringing cup ramen in a thermos so my mom wouldn't have to pay for lunch after we got off free/reduced lunch or fight with people cutting in line making us panic.

I just now saw our friend and guest making food my roommates and I all bought for himself. This isn't a problem, except it was one of the foods I know is ""safe"" for me and my brothers to eat, as we all have slightly restrictive diets, and my youngest brother the most and he doesn't always eat what we cook together. (Tbh my brothers and I probably have Eating disorders of some kind.) 

Now, My friend didn't eat all of this food source, and I can just buy more. But there's this feeling of: I didn't buy that for you to eat, I bought it as a ""safe"" food my brothers and I that we can always eat. You can eat so many things, why are you eating the things I know are ""safe"" for us? I love my friend, and he gets shaky when he gets hungry. So of course he should eat! I can just go buy more frozen pizzas. But it bugged me enough that I went to my room to write this.

The same thing as above, but about my child nieces, I get overly protective about food I eat, I don't want them to know I have \_\_ Food, then freeze. I can't keep food away from children, that's absolute nonsense, they should have access to food if they are hungry. I shouldn't get mad if they're a little wasteful either, they're just kids, and I want them to be happy and enjoy visiting.

My friends also eat larger quantities than me, and I catch myself thinking: ""You're eating too much, there won't be enough food for everyone. We'll run out. Can't you eat just 2 slices instead of 4?"" 

**I do this the WORST about Money:**

I'll deny myself luxury foods, I'll feel like a waste of space, I'll scrimp and save, I'll judge others for spending, I'll feel bad buying anything that's not just ""essential"" I'll go into a period of selling my stuff because I feel bad for having stuff instead of money in case of emergency. I'll actively not eat, buy fast food, take out food, and etc. to not feel bad about spending money. I'll tell people I'm not hungry, and that I just ate when they offer me to buy food. I'll put money into savings and only touch it for dire emergencies. I'll sometimes deny myself food as a punishment if I feel bad. (Though I've 90% corrected this, I don't do it often anymore.)

I often catch myself thinking: ""Gosh, this person just can't go without \_\_\_\_? They've never had to just, wait, sacrifice, or not get something, or get a cheaper version of something. Can't they just go without \_\_\_ like me?"" Then I have to stop and think: ""That's not healthy, Totally-Rad-Bro. That's not healthy and not fair. Why should they go without?"" But it's ok if its me.

I *NEVER* Want to tell my friends these thoughts when I have them, I don't want to have them associate negativity with basic needs, and especially eating, I already do that. So these are things I NEVER say aloud, or act on, but I do quietly stew about it on my own. I've been a lot better about it, sorta, and I'm trying to solve these feelings. 

They're like a bunch of thoughts, and rules and guidelines, and the weird part is they ""reset"" After I go to sleep. If I'm hungry, or feel upset for doing one of these things like, not working, not being productive,. I'll feel bad about it, and wish the day was over, or want go to sleep so it ""Resets"" the day like a video game mechanic. This applies to all bad moods, Food and hunger, or if 1 thing goes wrong during the day. ""Welp time to go to bed and reset.""

But I wanted to know if this is stuff other people face? How can I uproot these thoughts and feelings? Does anyone have any tips? Or feel similar? Am I alone in this weird set up of rules I've built? I'm working on them honestly this is the best I've been ever, but there's more progress I want to make, and I guess I wanna know if I'm alone in it or not.

i don't have many friends today but the few friends that i do... i realize that most of them were bullies earlier on in our friendships, like the first few years, but i wasn't confident enough to really call them out most of the time.

only thing now is that they are no longer that way anymore, and we aren't as close especially due to the pandemic, so i'm kind of conflicted about how to feel.

i guess it's in the past, but i think i'm more mad at the fact that certain types of people really are drawn to people with lower self-esteem and will take advantage of them or bully them to feel better about themselves. i feel like people were able to sense that in me and my mannerisms. and me lacking boundaries, i just wanted to feel needed so i'd be \*too\* easygoing.

1112,vent-112,1613419568,"Hi all, first time posting here. I was very recently diagnosed with CPTSD, and I’m starting to understand how it’s been affecting my life. The biggest part is intimacy with my partner, we’ve been together for almost 3 years now. I love them so much, but part of my past trauma is really getting in the way of enjoying things and feeling safe. During my teenage years, I had two horribly abusive partners. When I left the relationships, I kept remembering things that happened, long after they happened. Something would trigger the memory, and it sent me into the biggest spiral, with an attempt on my life. Now years later, although I’m glad I’m still here, the trauma still stays and I don’t know what to do about it. The past few months my drive has been so low compared to my partner, and I just keep feeling like I’m not good enough. Me and my partner recently got a new thing to try for sex, and the sensation of it sent me back to my birthday, and I just felt disgusting and then I just went numb again. Then yesterday we were once again, just getting into things not using the new thing, and then I just froze. I just started panicking and my partner is wanting to know what’s going on. But I just can’t find the words. I just completely ruined our Valentine’s Day. Our anniversary is tomorrow, which makes me happy but sad because I’ve upset them so close to our anniversary. After 3 years I just keep having these periods of feeling unsafe during sex, I’m so comfortable with them, but the past feeling of not being safe stays. I don’t know what to do to make myself feel safe, and I don’t know how to tell them that I don’t feel safe right now. I feel like if I say that it’ll be taken personally and I’ll just get “why don’t I make you feel safe?”. It’s not personal to them, it just feels like I can never just “get into it” like where you can just “let yourself go”.  I just want to know if there’s any advice anyone has for feeling safe and how I can talk to my partner about this. Thank you in advance",CPTSD,I don’t know how to feel safe in intimacy again.

1113,marianadepths,1613419528,"I've had a lot of downtime this week and for some reason my brain wanted to think about what 'fear of abandonment' means to me, which left me wondering what it means to other people. So I'd be keen to hear others' thoughts. 

I've always joked that I have a fear of abandonment. But strictly speaking I'm not sure, because I don't tend to worry about getting left, rejected, or dumped. What I do fear intensely, at the very core of my soul, is neglect and apathy from people I love so much that I can't walk away from them. I fear being trapped in that hazy middle-ground where someone gives you \*just enough\* love to keep you alive and hopeful, but not anywhere near enough to nourish you. I fear people I love watching and listening to me in pain in a situation where they could help, but not registering that my pain held any significance. And I fear not being able to walk away when that happens. So to me, there's no fear that a person will wholly abandon/leave me (and actually this feels preferable), but rather that the person will stay but my needs will be 'abandoned,' if that makes sense. Neglect was, obviously, a feature in my childhood, and I was clever enough to pick the right folks to recreate it in romantic relationships. 

Anyway, I don't know if that comes under the abandonment umbrella or if it's something else, but I'm interested to hear what fear of abandonment means to others and whether you think fear of neglect is basically the same thing or not. Thanks in advance for sharing to anyone who is willing to do so.

So I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and our heating stopped working.  I tried to fix it myself in anyway I could to avoid calling maintenance. My parents would constantly invade my space in emotional, physical, and sexual ways so it's ungodly triggering to have strangers in my home with me.

I switched from fawning to trying to be assertive and it was just a trainwreck. They are coming today again to fix the heating and we worked out that I would call him when I was available on Monday (aka when my boyfriend will be home). I'm really bad at asking for help so it's a big win for me that I asked my boyfriend to be here when maintenance was. I called the maintenance guy today and he was really pissed and agitated that my time didn't align with his schedule even though he said, ""call me for whatever time works for you on the day!"" so... I feel guilty for asserting that I need it to be at a certain time but that's exactly what we agreed upon before. I'm scared of this guy being in my apartment.

Is it even right to think of specifics? I don’t understand how this works, I don’t understand what he means when he asks me to think about my own wants and feelings. I literally don’t get it.

Sometimes when I'm doing something while I'm feeling fine, I suddenly get an awful flashback from my past and then I don't feel fine. I feel angry and I just want to do something to make that pain or distress go away and I need reassurance that it is just in my head and it's not current. I hate when those memories come up that I just want to get rid of it immediately. I almost need an escape from how I feel.

I can relate when she said she likes animals over people. I can relate where she keeps working to escape how she feels about her trauma because it's so painful. I can relate when she always has to act like she is okay she when she is not. I can relate to her and I understand how all ot that made her into her persona.

This is my first post on this reddit so here it goes. Here's my trauma. I an HSP (highly sensitive person) and during grade school due to me being an HSP, I cried the most out of all my peers and most people misunderstood me because of that. A couple kids did see me as an easy target due to that and one kid bullied me very badly my entire 2nd grade year. He physically abused me several times and mentally tormented me. After 2nd grade, I believe that trauma was slowly getting to me and I think it really got to me in middle school where I felt so unhappy and scared that I needed to talk to someone. In 7th grade, I went to the school counselor a lot and instead of supporting me, she emotionally and verbally abused me when I was 12-13. She even said one time I wouldn't have gotten bullied in the first place if I wasn't so sensitive. That messed me up even more to the point where I became completely self-destructive and unable to handle life. 6 years later at 19 years old, I'm still struggling and I sometimes have nightmares, I have anger issues, struggle with anxiety and depression, I get paranoid sometimes, difficulty trusting others and sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. I just realized these traumas affected me for 6 years and more and that realization makes me so sad and angry. I never been diagnosed with complex PTSD but I do believe I have it so I will see a professional soon.

I have problems with this clinic to begin with, because they always mess up the pharmacy and medication and appointments and are rude. But this NP, she is nice. She went over my history in our original appointment where I stated my trauma and abuse and present stand-point. That was hard enough. I told her because I knew she needed that info for records.

“The movement of descent and discovery begins at the moment you consciously become dissatisfied with life. Contrary to most professional opinion, this gnawing dissatisfaction with life is not a sign of ""mental illness,"" nor an indication of poor social adjustment, nor a character disorder. For concealed within this basic unhappiness with life and existence is the embryo of a growing intelligence, a special intelligence usually buried under the immense weight of social shams. A person who is beginning to sense the suffering of life is, at the same time, beginning to awaken to deeper realities, truer realities. For suffering smashes to pieces the complacency of our normal fictions about reality, and forces us to become alive in a special sense—to see carefully, to feel deeply, to touch ourselves and our worlds in ways we have heretofore avoided. It has been said, and truly I think, that suffering is the first grace. In a special sense, suffering is almost a time of rejoicing, for it marks the birth of creative insight.

But only in a special sense. Some people cling to their suffering as a mother to its child, carrying it as a burden they dare not set down. They do not face suffering with awareness, but rather clutch at their suffering, secretly transfixed with the spasms of martyrdom. Suffering should neither be denied awareness, avoided, despised, not glorified, clung to, dramatized. The emergence of suffering is not so much good as it is a good sign, an indication that one is starting to realize that life lived outside unity consciousness is ultimately painful, distressing, and sorrowful. The life of boundaries is a life of battles—of fear, anxiety, pain, and finally death. It is only through all manner of numbing compensations, distractions, and enchantments that we agree not to question our illusory boundaries, the root cause of the endless wheel of agony. But sooner or later, if we are not rendered totally insensitive, our defensive compensations begin to fail their soothing and concealing purpose. As a consequence, we begin to suffer in one way or another, because our awareness is finally directed toward the conflict-ridden nature of our false boundaries and the fragmented life supported by them”

An old woman answered the phone, and she was so rude. She kept saying ""if you would read the letter"" and ""if you would just google our website"". Which, fair, I understand that the information is available online and I should have checked beforehand. But I was trying to clarify their services, cause I wanted to make sure I understood correctly, and she said ""well since you seem to believe we don't do anything over here"".

I was appalled. I said ""I apologize if that's what came across, that wasn't my intention and I'm aware this association does very important work"".

And anyway this continued. She kept urging me to not ""do anything"" and to just speak with the contacts they had provided through the previous e-mail (not her, someone else). At one point she said ""we don't want people who aren't clear on what they want to do"".

I have heard that sentence before and I remember that situation was very, bery triggering. Like, blurred vision, couldn't walk straight triggering.

I keep having this urge to call back and let her know she was rude as hell, and that I expected better from an association that was created to help people who found themselves in terrible situations. That I'm smart enough to understand that, thankfully, she isn't representative of this group and that there was absolutely no reason to talk to me like that. But I won't do this.

Anyway, after I finished the call I got the shakes, and I cried and I felt bottled up and terrible. And whenever I tried writing out the exact sentence which I believe might be a specific trigger, it would start all over again.

Anyway, this was super long. I was just really shaken up about it. I'm feeling a bit better, now that I've cried and written it out and everything.

1130,Dumpster-Ghost,1613408396,"I got diagnosed about 2 and a half years ago after being retraumatized and entered in to an IOP. I was retruamatized again with a new and unique trauma about a year and a half ago. It was an uphill battle before that and even steeper after being retraumatized again. I entered the same IOP and they actually let me stay for almost a year because of covid. I had to leave a few months ago because I had made progress and they thought I was ready to move to a long term therapist. 

This is where it starts to get dicey. From the day of my diagnosis I was under the impression that the resources were out there for me with Medicaid. I was able to access many treatment options and resources at my IOP. When I left, the program I go through now gave me an intern. I didn't have a problem with that at first because despite her inexperience she is very kind and helpful and I like talking to her. 

But then I requested couples/family counseling because sometimes my partner has a hard time understanding when I'm entering being triggered or when I need help grounding myself. This can result in some unhealthy behaviors by me that cause a ton of shame and guilt afterwards. We were able to access it at my IOP and it was extremely helpful in providing him education from a professional on what I go through and the parts of it he doesn't understand.

The program I'm in now didn't flat out deny me anything but they implied that if my partners therapist isn't at their program they won't do anything for me. Additionally when speaking to my Mother about it she implied to me she's had similar experiences. On medicaid she's often given interns and when they move up she has to start over with a whole new people. This shook me up because I don't know if I can handle starting all over with another person again any time soon. I've already opened up to so many counselors to have to start over. Each time it feels like I'm starting from scratch having to reprocess and tell them these horrible things I've experienced again.

She also said that because they make such minimal money for medicaid they might be trying to get my boyfriends insurance to pay for the couples/family counseling. My intern is the middle man this program won't communicate with me directly so I can't ask more questions or get more info. They've never picked up the phone. 

Talk therapy also hasn't done much for me over the years. I really want to try EMDR therapy but can't afford that or find a doctor who will take my insurance. I think that psychedelics might really help me too but I strongly doubt I'll ever be able to get my insurance to cover a legal route for that. I feel like I'm at a loss. 

I was doing so well but recently have been experiencing some harrasment that triggered me in to a blubbering mess a few weeks ago and I haven't been able to truly stabilize. Looking for resources has made me feel even more hopeless when I realize that there isn't really anything out there for me. Right now I'm a state MMJ patient and in talk therapy. I don't want to take ssri's. I need to stabilize my thoughts. I truly believe if I could stabilize my thoughts I could stabilize emotions. 

If anyone has information on resources in NJ that might apply to my situation it would be so greatly appreciated. I haven't felt this bad and so long and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud with the resources available to me now.

When I was a teenager I displayed symptoms that were very similar to a covert narcissist. I was extremely passive aggressive and envious of others. I was also very controlling. But mostly in a negative light. I was shy, reserved and withdrawn. I had a need to be needed and given attention. So as a result I sought out positions that would enable me to do this. Positions of authority. I applied to be a moderator in a game server of around 3-4k active players but with at least over 25k accounts had been registered in this game server and I got the position and I was a moderator for a couple of months.

Part of it was that I genuinely loved what that community provided me, friendships, etc and I wanted to give back. But another part of it was to control people. I was power hungry and desperate for a sense of control because I felt like I did not have control of my life in real life due to my abusive mother. I enjoyed being in control and in a pedestal above others. I liked having more authority then them. 

I was quite corrupt as well to be honest. I abused my moderator privileges a lot and as it was a game server. Used them to cheat and gain points. I used my moderator immunity to prey on people and target them and ban them. I feel like I should’ve been demoted and banned for good to be honest. I was also corrupt in the sense that how I got the position was nepotism. Meaning my friends helped me cheat on the interview and gave me answers to questions there. I’m pretty sure they also recommended me to be a moderator. This is also another similar sign of a covert narcissist. As they usually have this entourage around them that acts out for their and serves as a 3rd party to them.

I was also extremely envious of others. As a result I would be passive aggressive instead of being direct and honest with them. I would guilt trip them, target them in games and build up small snippets of evidence so I could ban them. Once I successfully did that and banned someone although the senior mods stepped in and unbanned that person I targeted. I did not get demoted though. But as a result that person never spoke to me again. The reason why I did that- I’m not justifying it. Was because we had an extremely dysfunctional friendship and I was not setting boundaries. To be honest I didn’t know how and as a result I grew resentful of the emotional labour they were putting onto me so I lashed out and started building up small snippets of evidence and banned them. 

Yeah I just wanted to share this somewhere. I am working on this and shifting to healthier coping mechanisms and ways of being. Again.

1144,buttfluffvampire,1613402005,"(Spoilers)  My spouse and I were watching Your Lie in April last night, and I was really enjoying it. But when the protagonist (boy) finally gets back onstage to accompany the violinist (girl) and she passes out at the end of the performance, I freaked out.  I just knew that because the boy had achieved some happiness, she was going to die.

After processing it a bit, I've realized that a big part of me believes that happiness has a steep price that must be paid.  Either someone is sacrificing themselves on your behalf, or you have to sacrifice some equal and opposite part of yourself to be happy.  

My family glorified sacrifice growing up.  My dad could have had a better job, but where he worked allowed me to go to a private high school that offered a much better education than the local public school.  My mom's job made her miserable, but her wages kept us afloat while my dad worked at the school for a pittance.  School trips I went on were at the expense of anniversary trips or dates my parents sacrificed.  New clothes, shoes, and school supplies were an expense and burden on them.  Resting when I was super, super sick left them with my chores to do.  (I grew up on a farm, so there were a lot.)  They pushed back their retirement a couple of years because my sibling and I went to college.  Everything I owned, every privilege I had, it was hammered home that those good things happened because someone else experienced an equal misery on my behalf.

That also applied to happinesses I wanted to take for myself.  For example, I had my heart set on getting into a good college, but of course, that's expensive.  So I took every advanced and college-level course available, and eight or nine extracurriculars.  I wouldn't get home until nine or so, and then I'd have five or six hours of homework to get through.  I got so little sleep for so long, I honestly thought that if I wasn't actively falling asleep, I was well-rested.  I permanently damaged my immune system to the point that for a while, I wasn't expected to live long enough to graduate from the college I was working so hard to get to.  But that's just the price I believed I had to pay to go to the school of my choice.

But it does explain why I get so uncomfortable or even angry when my spouse is nice to me--I never asked him to make himself miserable on my behalf!  (He swears that making me coffee or helping clean up a mess I created doesn't make him miserable or irritated, but it's hard for me to believe.). And it explains why, when things are going reasonably well, I am constantly looking out for whatever bad thing is inevitably going to happen.

Happiness is zero-sum.  If I'm happy, it's because someone else has suffered for it.  If I want to make someone else happy, I must sacrifice for it.  If I want to do something nice for myself, have I punished myself enough to deserve it?  I logically know that's not the way it works, but what I know and what I believe aren't reconciling well here.

It was crummy to end Valentine's Day with an epiphany/panic attack, but at least now it's visible so I can work on it.  My next therapy appointment is next week.  In the meantime,  has anyone else struggled with this?  Any recommendations for steps I can take or resources for working through it?",CPTSD,Realized I think happiness is zero-sum,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lkfkyw/realized_i_think_happiness_is_zerosum/,1613373205.0
1145,cassigayle,1613401335,"Baking is the best kind of chemistry. Simple, accessible, and edible. It also requires a specific order of operations and mindfullness as you count the teaspoonfuls. When i am solid enough to trust myself with a hot oven and an electric mixer, it's a very rewarding process and leaves me feeling empowered and accomplished. Plus, it puts a smile on my family which is always a win.

So, here is my current work in progress, a recipe for Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies i have been modifying for a while. This batch came out with super fluffy dough and super moist thick cookies with a slightly crunchy surface. Husband says it's his favorite so far. Enjoy the recipe. 

Anybody else have a favorite baking recipe that helps them feel productive and just yummy?



Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies 

1/2 Cup softened unsalted butter
1/2 Cup granulated sugar
1/2 Cup dark brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 med eggs
1 Cup +5 Tablespoons pumpkin puree- make sure it's not pie filling

2 1/2 Cups baking flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground nutmeg

1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
(full size chips are great for bigger cookies, bigger cookies take longer to bake through at 325°)

Oven to 350°
Grease cookie sheet or place parchment paper

Cream together butter and sugars in a large bowl.
Add vanilla and eggs. Blend well. Really well.
Add pumpkin and blend it in till smooth and consistent.

In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. 
Use a whisk to gently mix so all dry ingredients are well blended and you don't poof yourself too much. Nutmeg in the nose is a sneezefest.

Add dry mixture to pumpkin mixture about 1/4 cup at a time, blending well between scoops. This recipe my dough is fluffy almost like a mousse.

*If it gets too thick to mix, add a little more pumpkin 1 Tablespoon at a time.

Add chocolate chips and mix with spoon or rubber spatula.

I prefer to chill the dough in the fridge for at least 20 minutes before baking.

Use a soup spoon (cereal spoon? Regular spoon?) to spoon portions onto greased pan/parchment. This dough will not spread much, but it is very moist so i space these out at least 2 inches apart. The dough is similar to drop biscuits in consistency and will form little peaks and knobs which help make the slightly crunchy outter texture.

Baking needs an eye kept on it depending on your oven. Start with 8 minutes. Press lightly on top of a cookie. If it sinks or squishes, do another 3 minutes. Check again. Add time in 2 minute increments from here. I called it at 15 total when the cookie was a little brown on top and had a slightly springy feel when pressed. 

Let them cool on the sheet to crisp the bottoms a bit or put them on a cooling rack after 2 minutes of settling. 

I think i will get about 4 dozen from this batch. 
Dough stores covered in fridge for ~3 days.
You can freeze it in quart freezer bags for longer hold. Keep the bags thinner so it thaws evenly in fridge before baking.

The author explained one simple method by whitch you'll be able to detatch that ""link"" between negative emotion and context. It might look hard at the begginning but its really simple you just have to become aware of yourself and follow the instructions. Once you give the techniques a try and start to acknowledge feelings, thoughts and let them go, you realize how great you can feel

Two days after I've started this audiobook i finally understood how it should be done. After 2-3 hour's I feelt much more alive and then I've spended entire week seeking for every suppressed emotion. Wish I read it earlier. I hope that you'll be able to take this first step into better, shining tommorow.

1152,LordDestrian,1613396308,"So to those who do not know me, I'm from India and I'm a 21yo male. My dad and mum's marriage was forced onto my mum due to which my mum was extremely abusive, verbally, physically and emotionally growing up. My dad on the other hand has been and is still the most abusive person alongside my sister in the family. My sister loves living in denial and is a selfish piece of s*hit but she masks it up by portraying herself to others as a well-wisher. 

I've always known my dad was an abusive c*unt cuz he had an extremely abusive mom and dad he couldn't be around. So he usually stayed at his mom's brother's house and they essentially raised him. His mom's brother, essentially my grandad is huge heaping pile of s*it. Of course it was as apparent to me growing up since I was in denial mostly about my family's abuse and my own trauma as a result.

Now that I'm done with college and have been on anti-depressants for 5 years, I can see shit like I could never before. 

We, as a family came to our hometown cuz dad wanted to do something and for some reason he had to drag us all along and we were staying at our ancestral house. Our ancestral house is old like it was actually built in 1920 old. Its got tons of mosquitoes and dusty floors since no one lives here and I developed several allergies and wasn't able to sleep for almost a week. 

As a result, I decided I would stay over at my grandad place (my dad's uncle) since we used to stay there with them when we came to our hometown as kids. From the very start I noticed a lot of stupid s*it my grandad and grandmother would pull on me. For example, after a single day of sleeping downstairs with them, they sent me to their penthouse, saying ""Nobody will disturb you there"". My grandmother would often ask me to go to my house to eat as what she cooked isn't that special and I deserve to eat something special (which is bullcrap). Soon after, my grandad pops up uninvited to the penthouse, like he actually opens the door and sees me watching YouTube videos on my phone with two fans running (They've got 3 fans there cuz it gets super hot and they know i sweat like a pig even if I walk a foot cuz of my meds) and says if you're gonna keep doing this (Having two fans on when watching YouTube videos cuz to him its okay if I have two fans on when studying), its going to be really hard for you to survive in the future. Soon after he asked me why I was on my computer all day long (Since according to him computers are useless and just used to pass time) I said it was for my final year project and as a computer science student this was my thing. He scowled and said ""Oh I thought you finished your degree"" After that day though a lot more sh*t followed. I was frequently asked to go home and eat almost 2 to 3 times a day. Once my grandmother asked me to eat at my house cuz apparently they're gonna be cooking fish on that day and she wouldn't be. As I went to the kitchen to wash my plate, I saw her marinating fish. My grandad on the same day told me that ""Just cuz of you, the power consumption in this house has increased by 40 to 50 units and I'm going to have to pay more than 500 rupees as a result."" I went out that day and only came back to their house late at night and my grandad told me ""That he shorted a circuit accidently ironing in the penthouse and there's no power there"" also the water in the overhead tank had coincidentally run out completely and they hadn't filled it till I was there at night even though they had no other work. P.s My grandad is 65 or so and is in excellent health, as is my grandmother. He's been retired so he has no excuse tbh. I slept with them downstairs again and was out of their home for a day or two. When I got back there yesterday morning to pickup a few things I asked my grandad if the power was back on and he had this nasty expression on his face like I was robbing him and nodded no, I said ""Well, then I'm gonna sleep at my house then"" and walked out.

My question is this, ""Are they really being good grandparents? If so, is this how you treat someone who is your guest? Specially since you're sitting on tons of useless cash that no ones gonna use anyway. 

I forgot to mention that my granddad's own daughter doesn't seem to give two fucks about him and neither does his own grandkid who he spent all his time and energy on to the point that he'd rid us off shit so he could buy his own granddaughter shit. They can't stand him and I can see it clearly as they don't visit him even when they're barely a 5 min walk away. I think he deserves it.

1153,epideictic_possum,1613395136,"I'm writing a deeply traumatic novel (think Octavia Butler). When I started I didn't have much reaction to the bad stuff. I guess I was still desensitized. But today I can't even watch stuff like ""Anne with an E"" because of too much child abuse. Part of healing is de-minimizing trauma. Hell, I couldn't even watch Blood of Zeus (anime on netflix). But my novel is WAY worse. It's like a Greek tragedy on steroids. 

I know why I've included so much of this stuff in my novel. Writing about trauma was literally a central theme. But now that theme is getting harder to stay with. A big part of me wants to leave it all in the past. But I've poured so much into this novel and I've been told it's really good with a lot of important messages plus really strong characters. I think I have to finish it. For myself and for others. I don't think I can look away until it's done. Like, I need the peaceful resolution just for my own mental health. 

My next novel hit me all at once, one day. It will take place 20 years after this first one. Instead of being deeply traumatizing it will be about healing. And now I see that I absolutely need to write that second novel, also for myself. I need the catharsis of both. 

I don't know why I'm writing this post. I guess I just figured out just how triggering my own novel is. It's like I've been able to actually transmute and capture my suffering into words, even though it's only an allegory.

1157,lecollecteur,1613393605,"I know this isn’t the right place to ask for relationship advice but I thought that you guys might understand the gravity of how this situation has made me feel as a result of having an abusive childhood.

My boyfriends family hates me. We have been together for almost two years. I have never met them, I have never spoken to them, I don’t follow them on social media. Everything they know of me is through him and vice versa. 

We are both living at home due to the pandemic, we have been unable to see each other for a while because of lockdown and our homes are far away from each other and neither of us drive. I moved back to my abusive home after he lost his job because we both planned to save and get a place together where I could escape this home, so I’ve struggled for the last year trying to survive here until we finally get to move together. 

The trouble started mainly around November. I was asking him if I would ever be able to stay over at his house for a while because I missed him and being isolated in an abusive home has ruined my mental health. He kept leading me on to the idea of staying at his and meeting his family for awhile and when December/Christmas time rolled around I kind of lost it. I just wanted to spend Christmas with someone. I couldn’t take being alone or with abusers anymore. It had ruined my life. I dropped out of school and couldn’t hold down a job. I begged him to just let me stay with him in his family home just for a night so I had some break from the isolation and abuse and he just refused? I would like to preface this by saying that before this he had been telling me that his family was disappointed in him for his association with me. I spent Christmas alone and he spent it with his family. They ostracised me. 

A couple of weeks ago I lost it again. I just can’t take the isolation and abuse anymore. I left home and slept outside for a couple of nights. I begged him to ask his family to let me stay for a night. They just kept refusing. They eventually made him change his number to get rid of me. He kept contacting me of course and said that he only did it to appease them.  

I love this man and he has chosen to stay with the people who hate me and exclude me. I can’t take how they treat me anymore. I want to kill myself because of this. I gave up everything for him and our plan to escape. But he’s chosen people that won’t even let me into their house.

But it is getting more frequent that I have to bathe her inflamed bum. Her litter box seems to hurt her so we've put rags in a secondary box to make it easier to pee. She pees herself often- right now while I type this even.

And I'm just so tired.

I feel so guilty, but I'm tired. I can't take care of her anymore. I can't go through with throwing money and time to prolong this state of life for either of us. I certainly won't abandon her at a shelter to likely get put down anyway- dying alone would be the worst right? I'm scared I'm going to be judged because she IS obese, and in the decade we've had her we could never help her with that.

I love her so much. She's the first animal of this family unit I've made that's leaving us. This is is also the first time I've had to face down this decision and really deal with death. I was kept relatively sheltered from death, and no one was there for me when I needed grown ups in my life to help me navigate the concept early on.

When it came to death what I saw was that my mother seemed numb to it and like she didn't understand what I meant when I'd try to bring up the big subjects like ""what happens when we die?"" And my dad? Hoo. Gosh. It didn't matter what subject I started with or what I was trying to communicate, it always turned into me being on the receiving end of some verbal and emotional abuse.

So I imagine what I'm going through right now is that I've had a lot of very deeply suppressed emotions around death because I wasn't given the support to process my own grief. Now what is a perfectly reasonable decision to limit the suffering of a loved one is multiplied by all the other previous episodes in my life when I could not grieve properly so it's all hitting at once.

It's all very well and good that I can be self aware enough to spout this stuff out, but the heavy lifting of processing is hard. Getting real sick of being sad and bursting into tears, and it's getting in the way of my school work. It's definitely the longest I've stayed in one emotional state- and I f---ing hate it.

1164,ronaroma,1613390303,"Hello all,

here in my country we've been in some sort of lockdown since November. Lockdown means that we can still meet that occasional friend, but all social activities etc are cancelled. I'm a person that has no problem being alone for a few days, but eventually the situation will turn and it will mess me up extremely bad, feeling rejected and hated and eventually falling into patterns of self loathing. So this 'turn' usually happens after a maximum of four to seven days, even in normal times. It's probably due to a history of childhood trauma/bullying which lead to my inability to relate to others like normal people do. Needless to say that the lockdown would affect me quite badly. And it did. My mental health plummeted a lot and I started to engage in self harm etc. Also, I had the feeling that  if my social relationships were rocky in normal times, during the lockdown most people wouldn't bother to reach out at all, or not answer messages etc. So this was in November and early December.

At that time I used to live alone and with no help available and the covid situation/lockdown worsening, I decided to move back in with my parents (which is usually also a rocky relationship, lots of fights etc). Surprisingly, I felt better almost immediately. I stopped the self harm and self loathing and went back to a more stable self. But I also stopped reaching out to friends entirely. I don't even feel the need for it, sometimes don't respond for days and haven't met anyone in 2,5 months (though I usually crave human contacts and wish I could relate healthily).

While I'm happy that I'm stable right now, it also has me worried that I might be falling back into unhelpful patterns (let's say, worse than before). Where I'm avoiding people because it's easier to avoid others than to be avoided. Where I can't practice my social skills. Or maybe it's also kind of a revenge... ""nobody"" cared about me when I had to deal with living alone in this situation, and now I'm unleashing it even on the two people who did reach out (and are living alone as well)? I feel like I'm in complete denial, some sort of mental survival mode, just trying to keep any more ""existential"" damage far away from myself.

Might that be possible a possible explanation for my behavior? What else might? How to deal with this all in a more constructive way without being overwhelmed by triggers?

I'm still a child, even my title is childish. I have outbursts. The guy that I like has outbursts. Is very childlike. I don't understand sexuality. I think intimacy is gross. I lack the capacity to love and it seems like it's true with who I have liked since I was 10 years old as well. I probably like him because he's childish in that he can't give love. He's known for actually being a womanizer... Any and all questions welcomed I just wanted to vent. I thunk I should be able to love at this point and I think I want to keep spending time with him. I feel happy when we part; like I have awesome times with him. I leave with my cup full. He doesn't take away from me. But I think I'd like to actually love for once. I'm not sure if he should be someone I can love though. I get tired out while hanging out with the guy sometimes; I have anxiety issues and self esteem issues. I enjoy doing nothing with him. Just me and him... Some of the best times in my life are when I'm doing nothing but myself. I'm working on self esteem and being focused on my goals. Right now I'm trying to learn about id and super ego. If you have knowledge on that I'd like if you shared! Something else I'm looking into is development of sexuality.

In my childhood, it was a fire that got me into a lot of trouble and got me into a lot more harm than I might've been in if I'd been quiet and submissive. But I've always been really spunky, with a lot of moxie and bite, and it's driven me my whole life. 

All the adventure games and movies where the hero has to be brave, even in the face of great danger or evils, were my absolute favorite, because I saw myself in them. I didn't want to be *like* them because I knew I already was. I had faced great danger and evil my whole life, in my abusers and the mental and physical harm they did to me for years, and was brave and steadfast in the face of it. I looked at bruises, or scars, and was proud of them, because I was still here. I still am proud of them. No matter how much suffering I've gone through or how impossible it seemed to move forward, I have.

I read so much misery and loneliness on here, and I feel kind of alone in that while I'm not a stranger to wanting to give up, or feeling like there's no way out, there's still that fire inside me that tells me to keep going, even if it's just to find out what's next.

I'm never happier than when I'm somewhere I don't know, finding new things. I love to explore strange places, alone, because it feels free. And in a way, life's most uncertain times is just like that.

I (26F) let my ex (26M) move into my place temporarily until he found a new place to move into. When living here he mistreated me pretty badly and broke some of my stuff (without telling me). Everytime I asked him to leave he told me I was blackmailing him and making him ""homeless"". I finally hit my limit when he lied to me about messaging other girls and called his friend to come pick him up.

He has collected most of his things, apart from his guitar. He broke my guitar which I let him use, and has not fixed it (he had ample time to). He keeps saying he will fix it if I give him my guitar, but I feel like its just another lie and I don't trust him anymore. Especially seeing as when he knew I was at work on Friday he came to my house with a friend and broke into my garage (rather than waiting for me to be home and open it for him, which I said i would do).

I have PTSD from a home invasion so this was too far. I blocked him yesterday and my therapist said I need no contact for a bit. Am I entitled to keep his guitar as he broke mine (as well as other things)?

He is going to try and contact me Friday as we are in lockdown where I live, and I don't want him to come to my house.

My step mother (undiagnosed narcissist/bpd) never let me cook. Always said I’d burn the house down. Cleaning chores piled up over the years, so much that I felt like Cinderella. I always felt like Cinderella....getting a few chances to help cook, like peeling potatoes, never learning to make the main courses like other kids. 
Anyway, I moved out of my parents house at 18 and in with my best friends family, then with a boyfriend, family friend, and so on. Through the years I learned a few staples to feed myself but had ultimately self identified as a grazer/snacker because I thought I was generally just bad at cooking - that I’d burn the house down like my stepmother said. 
Now that I’m in a long term relationship, likely headed to marriage, I’m trying to learn to cook more. Doing date nights like tonight with my partner where we try challenging dishes. After reading “Surviving to Thriving”, I knew I had to learn to ignore the mix of my mom’s voice in my head telling me I’m dangerous and my own inner/outer critics telling me to not try. So tonight, for the holiday, we made gnocchi. I had made it once before on a work team building event over zoom. NGL its so challenging. But I thought “date night, so this will be so fun”. 
Nope. It wasn’t at all. My partner was brought up in a family where he cooked from an early age; a home with parents who taught him good cooking habits and being aware of messes in the kitchen. As he and I are cooking together, working on an entire dinner from scratch, everything you can imagine happened. 
I burned myself, he did slightly, miscommunication, mess, and even the oven vent slightly malfunctioning. 
What was most difficult was how frustrated he got with me that I was “careless” and didn’t know how to move in a kitchen that is swift and knowledgeable, especially with him present. 
It was so triggering to know that very likely partner for life was so frustrated with me. I instantly doubted our future together, falling into an inner critic spiral and falling silent while we finished cooking the remainder of our special meal. 
He brushed it off and we ate our meal just fine. I eventually asked “how will we cook together when we move in together?” He jokingly said “we’ll just never cross paths in the kitchen. You’ll cook for you and I’ll cook for us.” He followed up with us needing to focus on more practice together. He’s open to teaching me recipes he knows and how to work around the kitchen like he does. 
All of this to say, you can be a snacker and a dish creator. If you’re struggling to battle your critics to make new dishes, try making them for other people on your days off. You’ll have all the time in the world to mess up and if turns out to be shit, you can laugh as you order pizza or takeout.

1190,angstyart,1613368870,"** Big TW here at the beginning. I know some eating disorders can be contagious in a way. I’m definitely discussing things I ate and if that is disturbing please don’t risk it. **

I don’t remember a lot of my early years besides a series of bizarre memories, a crazy sleep schedule, and the things I would eat. I remember very vividly to this day how most things taste, and it’s been getting to the point where I’m like “Seriously? Why do I remember and HOW did I find out what that tasted like?” I always associated neglect with later childhood and teens, but how was I to identify neglect as a 7 year old? It probably happened back then too, and a major reason why I believe it did is because I literally ate so many non-food items so regularly that I remember their taste as an adult. 

Here’s a brief list of what I distinctly remember eating/licking/chewing as a child:
- random plastic toys
- porcelain
- mottled ceiling (I had a bunk bed) 
- metal bunk bed railing 
- paint chips or strips
- wood varnish 
- packing peanuts 
- cardboard box
- memory foam or couch foam 
- silica beads
- toilet paper (hated this)
- hair 
- tape
- paper
- fabric in general
- rubber bands (very disgusting) 
- beads (just had a flashback of my sister choking on one unattended WOW) 
- plastic food from those fake kitchen sets. 

That last one? I actually slowly ate a piece of fake plastic bacon over the course of a few days. I liked the texture. 
These are just the things I’m comfortable mentioning. There are things I know the taste of that I am NOT comfortable mentioning. Nothing sexual just very disgusting. 

Were there consequences to this? Absolutely. I threw up constantly as a kid. For what my mom called “some reason”. She made me fill out a poison control worksheet once. That did very little, bleach was never appealing to me. I remember being hungry one day and just drinking an expired antibiotic drink my mom had left in the fridge from when I visited the dentist MONTHS before, because it tasted like bubblegum. Of course I constantly had stomach problems... I was eating random shit around the house. I would just randomly vomit on any given day or time. 

This also tells me how wildly and obnoxiously unsupervised, no- straight up ignored I was as a child. I worked my way into almost every household item and surface so throughly that I remember the taste of these things as a grown woman 10-15+ years later. What bullshit. I could have died. I SHOULD be dead. 

Even worse, I was expected to just cook my own food by 7. I burned my own arms constantly from being too small to be around the stove. I would undercook eggs. I remember not being able to find a knife once and cutting an orange with scissors. So even when I really was eating food, it was fucked up. It makes me feel stupid. It make me feel so much contempt for my parents, but I definitely feel like I was such a stupid child. I know that’s not right, but I don’t feel normal at all. Like my best friend was probably getting Oreos and goldfish in kindergarten and I was “being homeschooled” eating fucking wall and ceiling by myself.

Three months ago I got a full time position with better pay and a much better environment than the last store I worked at. It's much quieter and has less traffic. But I still dread going to work every day, being around people, not being able to do anything I enjoy, getting home late at night. And I'm trying to get out of being a fawn type but obviously retail reinforces all the habits I'm trying to break and leads me to have really nasty, toxic thoughts about myself even after I clock out.

Yesterday I hit my breaking point. An hour into my shift I started crying uncontrollably and had to leave. I had my day off today but I'm dreading going in tomorrow. I'm close to being written up for chronic lateness already and I've already called off a lot in the past month because of snow. We're extremely understaffed so asking for reduced hours or a few days off is not an option, which leaves me with either quit, be fired, or stay. 

Obviously being fired is not an option because that will affect my future job search. 

So if I quit, I'll be much happier and healthier. I'll be able to talk to my doctor about therapy or medication which might make me a better employee in the long run. But I'll leave a trail of destruction behind me as everyone struggles to keep up with the traffic during a busy time of year. Many people will be hurt and only I will benefit. Also I'd have to explain to a future employer why I quit a promising job.

If I go back to work as if nothing happened, I'm not sure when my next nervous breakdown will be or how bad it will be. It might just stop at crying or it might be self harm or I might hurt others. Or I might be able to dissociate and do my job just fine while being completely dead inside for however long that lasts. Nobody will be inconvenienced. 

I'm completely paralyzed. My fawning instinct is so strong that I can't think clearly about this and all my family can say is ""well it's you're decision you're an adult"" but I really don't feel like an adult right now.

So I am a victim of child abuse and neglect. Recently as I come into adulthood I have struggled with OCD, eating disorders, GAD, MDD, etc. I have felt like I can never be okay without trying. I can be outwardly doing great, but inward is a constant battle with myself. The past year has been the worst. Alcohol, casual sex,  self harm, developed an eating disorder, etc. My life has been unbelievably shitty and instead of trying to cope with it I just crumbled. Recently I have started along the road to recovery.

I have started eating more, trying to go to the gym, start on antidepressants, combat my obsessive compulsive tendencies, etc. however it just seems insurmountable. 

Recently though I have started to wonder if I’m approaching this the wrong way. I have always tried to hide my scars, both proverbial and physical. If I embrace them, and incorporate my survivorship status into my identity, will i be able to begin to heal?

1197,valor-1723,1613366510,"MAJOR CW/TW for Child Labor Trafficking, self doubt, and vague talk of violent abuse and witnessing. 

So I was diagnosed with CPTSD a few months back. I've also been in treatment for DID for about a year now. 

As I'm going through therapy I'm discovering a lot of my trauma that I previously had no memory of. I had vague ideas of things that have happened, but either no ""first hand memory"" or no emotional memory connecting me to the events. This specific experience happened in adolescents, so it was not the cause of my DID.

⚠️⚠️TALK OF POTENTIONALLY HIGHLY TRIGGERING TOPICS STARTS HERE.⚠️⚠️ 

So, one of the things I discovered was that child Trafficking doesn't always mean being shipped off to another country, and it's not always sexual. I learned that it can be local and that the victim can be sold or traded for a number of reasons. This really hit hard when both my therapist and myself learned that I had been a victim of what she called ""local labor Trafficking"". It was my birth father who covered his story by calling them my ""baby sitters"" when questioned by CPS, and making sure that I was returned to my father's custody for every CPS appointment, to avoid detection. 

I was with 5 other kids, and we were all responsible for handling all the manual labor on a farm. Everything from rock picking for 12 hours straight, milking cattle, birthing cattle, to slaughtering animals. It was grueling, but it wasn't the work that was hard, it was what would happen if you slacked off, got distracted, or if something went wrong. 

⚠️⚠️⚠️*I'm going to place another trigger warning here, as I want to talk briefly and vaguely about specific things I experienced, but I will also be naming trauma experiences. I will not go into detail, the end of this section will be marked below, and I will continue my vent after, so if you want to skip this part but continue reading, look for the alert emojis below the following paragraphs.* ⚠️⚠️⚠️

The youngest of the kids was 5 years old, the oldest being 11. If we slipped up, got tired, or anything we would be put in a ring and the other kids would be forced to beat the one who slipped up, we were held at gunpoint, starved, suffocated, waterboarded locked in isolation rooms... the list goes on... and that's not even the worst of it to be completely honest.

I lived in this situation for 4 years before my birth father got scared by authorities and backed out of whatever deal they had made... 

⚠️⚠️*End of the trigger warning above this*⚠️⚠️

Despite all this... despite everything that happened, I still don't feel like it was a valid experience. I know, logically, that what I went through was atrocious, but part of my brain keeps telling me ""Don't be such a baby, REAL Trafficking victims have it so much worse than you did"". I don't see myself as a Trafficking victim, but my therapist says it could be very healing to accept and see that I was a Trafficking victim, so that I can start to heal from it. She says you can't fully heal from things you aren't convinced happened to you, but if I can accept that it's a section of abuse that I've experienced I can find appropriate support, coping strategies and heal from a lot of my anxiety, shame and fear that stems from that. 

But I still can't get over this screwed up, backwards imposter type feeling that what I went through wasn't a valid Trafficking experience because I never left the country.

1201,Greasey_Guy,1613362126,"I've always felt distanced from others -  I would feel out of place playing with the other kids when I was little, I would be mocked all throughout school, I worked at a young age, thus causing a resentment towards capitalism, yet I could never escape it along with death, so I became very nhilistic. I had developed into a somewhat sick, mean, and careless individual in middle school (even too mean and nihilistic for your average middleschooler), doing shit that like wearing paper on my face with self-directed hate speech written on it just to get the thrill of receiving dirty looks. I took a strange and euphoric joy in self-deprecation and self torment - something that would grow like a tumor. In the summer of 8th grade, I had receded away from my ""friends"", becoming lonely and indulging myself in music to take my mind off of my loneliness. Music had become my passion, and I swiftly became good at guitar. Once high school rolled around, I had become so emotionally distant from everyone else that I was separated from everyone else. There was a mental block between me and everyone else. The girls would laugh together in groups, boys would make fun of each other, smart students would cooperate to knock down high homework amounts together, but I was separated from everyone else; I was the weird guy who sat in the back wearing shades and etching down whatever musical thoughts popped into my heads, like riff and lyrical ideas - I was and still am the outcast music nerd.

I always feared sex, which was induced by my mother putting her loathing and spite for sex into me from a young age. In middle and high school, the other boys would talk about how they found a girl so hot, girls would talk about how ripped a guy was, and shit like that, but I always felt disgusted by the sexualization and objectification of someone else. In middle school, when I felt horny, I would feel repulsed with myself and masturbate until I was physically unable to do so anymore, thus accidentally associating my hatred for sex with the act of sexual pleasure, so it grew into a cycle of lust leading to self pleasure, which lead to self hatred, thus making me masturbate more, thus making me hate myself more, yadda yadda. Eventually, I managed to beat the horniness out of myself, and I am unable to get horny - my genitals function, but my brain has been retrained to stop getting horny, which I don't even think is humanly possible.

In high school, I would grow romantic, non-sexual crushes on girls I watched from across the classrooms (kind of creepy, I know), but when I tried to make the moves, I was either too socially awkward to effectively express myself or in a pit of guilt for feeling these feelings, towards women, which is another phenomenon: I've always had an odd respect for women, subconsciously viewing them as being above me for having a vagina, so when I felt romantic attraction to girls, I felt I was unworthy, and when combined with the sheer amount of hatred I had for myself, I felt like I was insulting women for even having the mere thought of being in a relationship with one.

When I did effectively approach girls, however, I struck like a dagger; I would make small talk about what they liked and were interested in, judging by their clothing, accidentally overhearing their other conversations, etc. I would make decent friendships in a very disturbingly inhuman and sociopathic manner, observing them and formulating a plan in my head of what to say and respond with, boiling them and their responses down to numbers and variables, something that made me feel even more disconnected with everyone else, thus hating myself somehow even more and making me feel guilty for turning women into algorithms. I would then stop talking to these people completely, receding back into my self by ignoring them and cutting them off entirely (not a very wise chocie).

The guilt I felt for what my brain thought was me hurting women materialized itself into a twisted fantasy in which I was brutally beaten by all the girls that I think I have ever wronged, with each of them beating me to a pulp one at a time in a specific setting and style tailored to said girl. This recurring fantasy of self-punishment felt and still feels so right, yet I know it isn't normal, but the euphoric freedom I feel from it is absurd; I feel like I'm free of my guilt and self hatred, for I was served justice. I feel as though I was rightfully punished for my wrongdoings and evil deeds, but when I remember that my fantasy isn't reality, I swiftly return to my state of depression and self spite. Ever since the birth of this morbid fantasy a couple years ago, I have wanted nothing more than to be beaten up by a woman, with her serving as the one who will bring justice to all those I have wronged. It sounds so fucked up when I write it out, but in my head, it feels correct. This fantasy is triggered by contact with any woman who isn't related to me; I'm not sure if it is part of PTSD or self hatred or anything else.

My self tormenting and self hatred only grew, which caused me to write song after song about how much I hate my self and/or the world - about how much nothing I did and will do matters. While the lyrics and meanings were mostly edgy trash, they all sounded pretty good, with my standout one being an unofficial song, titled, ""Lord of the Horseflies"", a song about how, ""there may be a fork in the road, but in the long run,  every path that we take will only lead to one"". Needless to say, it was about nihilism, as well as having a strong verse and chorus melody, accompanied with two badass guitar solos. The fact that you can't find it on YouTube or Soundcloud shows the progress I've made with it, though, along with all of my other hundreds of unfinished works.

The sheer amount of disgust I had for myself wasn't aided my unfortunate home life either. I lived in a shit hole with a drunken father and overbearing and over emotional mother. The moment I realized just how much I truly despised my home life was on my 15th birthday. My parents and my unemployed sister began arguing over politics, which swiftly turned violent, with objects being destroyed, doors being unhinged and shouts echoing through the house; I then spent next couple hours of the night sobbing in my room. My mother came to not make me feel better or provide comfort, but to persuade me that she was right; she revealed all the cheating that my father had done and that they both wanted a divorce, but she refused to let him go. She would go from talking quietly to yelling to sobbing and so forth, all the while telling me what a worm my father is. She made me feel guilty for not siding with her, as I sided with nobody. I felt more alone that night than I have ever felt in my entire life; I cried myself to sleep, woke up, and I had to go to school the next day as though nothing had happened. I felt disgusted with my self for acting so cowardly, thus causing me to hate myself even more.

Well, those were the major chunks and parts of my life, with me now being out of highschool, but still feeling the same; I still hate myself just as much, if not more than I did. Not once have I cut myself, though, and I will retain the will and strength not to do so! I believe I am one strangely fucked individual with a somewhat self-aware and diluted perception of reality, but is there anything any of you can relate to? While I don't know if this constitutes as PTSD, I can certainly say a lot of the events were traumatic to me.

Since all of them have a long waiting list and i don't want to waste their time or mine, i thought about seeking specialized help so i want to narrow down who i should talk to. 

My question is specifically related to lived experience. I don't want to take some bs online test or just read some symptoms off of some website about mental illness. I want to see if my experience resonates with yours, if it feels familiar to you, reading about what happened to me and if i'm on the right track.

Long Read :

&amp;#x200B;

My early Childhood was mostly normal, i think. The earliest memories i have are about my Mom being in the hospital, since my sister had been born recently.  Shortly after that, we moved to a new flat and my Father started living with us from then on. He was staying in Russia, till he had enough money and a VISA to come to Germany. I was noticing very early on, that i was different. I wasn't a typical boy, i liked a lot of girly things, i had no interesst in roughing it up with the other boys in the playground, i didn't like soccer and i played with the girls a lot in Kindergarten. More and more, my Parents and my Kindergarten teachers nudged me to do less girly things like playing dress up or with dolls or such games and i didn't like it, but due to social pressure and being yelled at by my father, i complied.   


Shortly after, i was starting school and in my first year of primary school, i started to have what i would describe as traumatic experiences at home, that would not stop till about close to 2 years ago, when i finally moved out of my parents home. My father was an alcoholic and got abusive towards my mother. He would yell a lot, break stuff around the house, on occasion he would hit or shove my mother and when me and my sister where crying, he would yell at us to shut up, hit us or shove us around till we hide under the bed so he could yell at my mother some more.  


They were fighting a lot, but my mother never came around to divorce him or to throw him out. The Police came around our flat on some occasions, they would take my father with them but since my mother refused to press charges, he always came back. I became more and more afraid of him, but also, i began to hate him. The abuse went on for years. Later, as i got older, i tried to get my mother to leave him but she wouldn't listen to me. There were phases were my Father was not drinking and didn't act out. They would come and go and my Mother always hoped that the last time he abused her would be the last time for good, but of course, he would slip back into drinking again.   


Since both of them were working, i had to care for my sister a lot, bring her to Kindergarten, bring her back home, make her food, help her with her homework assignments, tidy our room, all while still being only like 9 years old myself. When i was alone at home, wich sometimes happened, i would try on my mothers clothes, walk around in her heels and try on some lipstick. I would do it, even though i was afraid like hell that my father could come home anytime and find out, but it never happend and it felt good. 

&amp;#x200B;

As i grew older, i became obese. I think i ate out of stress a lot. My Father was angry at me for being fat and forced me into some sport clubs, wich i would attend for a few weeks and then drop. Nothing could really motivate me, i was average in school, just phoning it in. I had a few friends to hang out with and read books and played video games a lot, to escape my misery at home, but every few months, sometimes weeks, my father would start to drink heavily again and something would always happen. I didn't feel safe at home.  


I wanted to move out as early as i could, but my Parents would pressure me into staying in school as long as possible. They wanted me to go to University, so i had to graduate the 12th year of school, called Abitur in Germany, this would allow you to a college or university in Germany. Still, i had a lot of opportunities to move out, but i didn't want to leave my Sister alone. She was getting more and more suicidal, had some attempts since she was 14 years old and i was the only one in our family to keep an eye on her. 

My Mother is generally a loving and caring person but she was of no help. She was never sensitized to mental illness, it just wasn't a thing in Russia, where she came from. I later found out, that she was abused by her father as well, i believe some form of domestic violence / abuse was just normal to her and she would say things like: ""you and your sister need to toughen up, get some thicker skins, life isn't easy"" and ""you don't know how good you've got it, i had to help my mother around the house way more then you and my father was even worse, i don't even know what you are so sad about"" and such things. Even so, this didn't help my sister at all, so i was the only one she had to really talk to, since she didn't like to tell her friends about such things.   


I decided to keep some things to myself as well, like my interesst in boys or my thoughts about transitioning, since i was afraid it would only complicate things. Also, i was already into puberty and thought, it was to late to transition and that i was stuck the way i am, that it would only make my life harder and so on. Ultimately, i was looking for excuses to not be who i really was, because i was afraid.  
This went on for some more years till finally, couldn't take it anymore.  


All this became just to much to handle. During a fight with my father, wich became physical, he slammed me into the wall beside our Door, opened it said i should leave. He did that some times, threaten to throw us out, when me or my sister did something he didn't like. I looked outside, then looked back at my father again and told him, i would get some clothes from my room and then i would be leaving.

  
I did just that and signed myself into a hospital wich specializes in Therapy. I don't know the exact English terms, im sorry. I was there for 3 Months, working on my guilt, my build up depression, my transition and my overall stability. i haven't seen, talked to or answered calls or messages from my father since then. This was nearly 2 years ago.   


Social services are paying for my flat and my expanses right now. I had plans to work again or go to university but Corona happened and i focused on my transition (talking to endocrinologists, having my  blood tested, finding the right dosage for hormones, etc) i started doing some volunteer work around the city i am living in and came out to my sister and my mother as trans. It was hard in the beginning, but it got better, they both promised me to not tell my father, since i feared he could try to contact me and i'm trying to avoid him.   


While volunteering i met my Boyfriend and we clicked instantly. We are together for nearly a year now, my transition is coming along nicely and Life seemed to come around for me finally, but a few months ago, the Nightmares started. I always had very vivid dreams, i thought it was normal, but friends of me told me, that they can't remember their dreams as good as me and that their dreams wouldn't be as vivid or spook them so much.  


My sleep pattern is getting more and more out of order, i get less and less sleep, my thoughts and emotions keeping me awake, regrets and fears, guilt and anger, thoughts of what i could have done differently, all bouncing around in my head. When i finally fall asleep, i often get Nightmares. Some are about various abuses by my father, the more intense ones being about the physical fights we got into when i stepped in to protect my mother or sister. The really fucked up ones are straight out of horror movies. Being locked in a room wich you can't escape from, being chased by shadowy figures, drowning, being ripped apart by some enormous animal and the most horrible ones are about the reality of the dream itself shifting to haunt me (imagine trying to open a door, but the doorknob bites you with metal teeth and the door slams into your face, or being swallowed by the ground, falling into an ever expanding black Abyss.  


These Nightmare feel so real. My Boyfriend said, he heard me cry out in my sleep, sometimes i awake in the middle of the night with the nightmare still fresh in my memory, my heart pounding like crazy and cold sweat all over my body. sometimes, i start crying. i can't go back to sleep after that happens, so i stay awake. It's worse when i'm alone (my boyfriend has his own flat and due to work arrangements, we can't sleep together all the time).

1211,DimStarLight,1613357462,"When my twin brother and I were 2 years old the state stepped in after either my mother or father were caught with hard drugs. I don't remember which one exactly, could have maybe even been both.

They separated me and my twin into separate homes after they witnessed the conditions we were living in. Our baby clothes and blankets had cigarette burns and stains all over them. We were abnormally underweight for our age, and spent most of our time screaming and crying for any sort of parental attention and care. I only know this because my older brother told me about his memories of it a while ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

While we were separated, apparently all we did was cry and cry and cry. The two foster families who received us apparently worked together to urge the courts to unite us into one family. Eventually they did, and me and my twin were together again finally. The family who took us made a lot of videos and tapes of my twin and I during our time with them. They seemed absolutely amazing, and we seemed so fucking happy. They had a large property in southern utah, lived in an incredibly nice neighborhood, and had trampolines, toys, large amounts of food etc. The tapes showed us playing and growing along side their biological kids in what seemed to be the perfect family and life. We looked so happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, my parents got out of rehab and demanded the courts to give us back. They fought hard, and eventually convinced a judge to do just that right around when we turned 4. He had admired how hard they had fought for sobriety and for their kids, so he took us from our new family and gave us back.

My parents of course relapsed again very shortly after that, and then began two entire decades of severe psychological and physical abuse. Always being hungry, always being scared, being severely neglected, witnessing my parents beat each other, watching them destroy their minds and bodies with hard drugs, having the cops over at our house every other weekend.

1217,Moodypineapples,1613352060,"Hi, I’m (18F) and over the past few months I’ve been trying to understand my mental health a lot, and a lot of signs recently have been pointing to PTSD.
I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for a lot of my life, I’ve had a lot of parental stress too, my mum, someone who has very flip flop emotions and tense, my dad, an alcoholic and passed away not long after I turned 15, both amazing people and I hold so so much love for them, just sometimes things feel/felt complicated, and I don’t know if maybe it’s linked to that? 
So,
1) with my dad, I found out about his drinking around the age of 12 and it was a big reality check, when my dad has always been someone I’ve idolised in my life, I would confront him and talk to him about his issues and we went in circles, to the point I’d just avoid seeing him for weeks (him and my mum have been split up since I can remember and don’t think that’s an effect) and the last time I saw him, was October 2017, and I tried to see him for my birthday (12 dec) after not speaking for months, because I couldn’t take it due to my mental health being generally bad, being around the toxic energy of a drunk was too much, and he wasn’t able to see me, we called and texted, and we were going to see him on Christmas Day, he wasn’t answering his calls and my mum drive to his house to find him dead on Christmas morning, so that was, something.
2) since my dad passed, I of course did what everyone does, you cry, you feel down, you get upset when you think about them, but for the past 3 years since he passed, I have refused to think about him, I don’t go anywhere near his street, I don’t think about him, I don’t cry over him and when I do think about him, it feels like 3 years ago, but distant, like I’m so distant from my emotions associated with him, it’s almost like he wasn’t real in my brain. And then during anything from cleaning my room, to in the middle of a conversation with someone, I’ll just have a thought like ‘he’s gone, you don’t have a dad’ and I’ve never really accepted that as true, and I don’t know if that’s a normal way to grieve or linked to a sort of trauma due to our relationship, he was wonderful and a life inspiration, but it was constantly going from 0-100 and back again with us.

2) my mum, she’s always been caring and when she understands, she’s supportive, but when it comes to me emotionally, and her emotionally, it’s very stressful. She can be really lovely and affectionate and understanding and caring at one point and then an our later she can be screaming at everyone in the house for forgetting to do something, or not doing a chore straight after one of me or my siblings have been told.
Or with my mental health, I always feel weird to talk to her about my mentality because of the way she can react, again, sometime it’s great, she’ll help me through things and if I tell her I need help, she will and other times she’ll be frustrated with me because I’m struggling with simple things, or saying I’m being dramatic, or suddenly shouting at me for things I can’t help.
For example, I recently started taking setraline a month ago and because of the side effects and that they can cause anxiety, I was telling her I had a moment were I almost had a panic attack, and she started talking to me in an agitated manner ‘why are you having panic attack? You’re on meds, they must not be working? They’re not supposed to do that, blah blah blah’ and it was really distressing and disheartening, and she commonly does this when I open up to her, so as time has gone by, over the years I just avoid talkibg about it, which caused her more frustration when I don’t tell her how I am.

3) This one has been confusing me a lot, because I can’t tell if it’s my normal anxiety or something different.
I’ve been havibg this experience or feeling, an example is, I was at my partners, completely content and we’ve been together for years so I’m always very comfortable and then suddenly I start to feel really tense and anxious and finding it difficult to breath and become shakey and it’s happened a few times, not on at hers but at many other situations too, and I’ve been making sure to backtrack what I was thinking about before feeling anxious, and it’s been nothing triggering I’d be thinking about.
I’ve also recently been having a need for physical touch, which is something I’ve noticed, I feel tense and I get upset when I’m alone, even just to feel someone stroking my shoulder or to be hugged etc, is something I crave a lot, which I never used to feel, and I have never been a super clingy person, and the only thing I can relate it to is separation anxiety, I see my partner every weekend, which is a lot during covid times, and whenever we say goodbye and the other goes home, I’m fine for a while and then I start to feel anxious without it and by the end of the week I just feel really tense.
Idk.

4) a few months ago I came across what ‘derealisation/depersonalisation’ which I related to a lot because I definitely am someone that feels very spacey and dissociates from strong emotions and time can fly very quickly for me but again, I don’t know for sure, I haven’t seen a therapist in years and cabt really figure out.

5) I’ve been tested for autism in the past, which was negative and was something that came up due to my anxieties and the dissociation and I’ve been meaning to read up on other neurodivergance disabilities just incase.

But yes, I’m not even entirely sure if it is PTSD, but I thought it would be good to post for some advice or other points of view.

1218,timelesstaxi,1613351626,"Hi I'm a first time poster and long time lurker. I was just diagnosed with CPTSD by a trauma therapist last week so now I have actual validation that my trauma is manifesting itself in a disordered way (as I've suspected for many years).

\*trigger warning\* sexual abuse 

So I've been going back through a lot of painful points in my life and one ex boyfriend has been repeatedly popping up in my mind. We dated very briefly at the beginning of college about 10 years ago. He wasn't really a bad dude but he retraumatized and stigmatized me (we were very young).

I felt safe with him and was kind of lost and looking for someone I could open up to. I mistakenly trusted him and told him about the sexual abuse I endured as a child. I was just coming to terms with it and I told him a basic overview when we were drunk (I know, bad idea). The next day he came over and told me he didn't want to see me anymore, ""Not because of what you told me though."". Ok. Well now I don't blame him for that, anyone can end a relationship for any reason - I don't hold resentment towards him for that reason. 

Afterwards, he was partying with a bunch of our mutual friends and I guess they asked why we weren't seeing each other anymore. He told everyone that I was, ""crazy"" and that he had to run from me (\*hilarity apparently ensued). I didn't find out until I was treated coldly by his roommates when I said hey in the cafeteria a few days later. We were in an intermural soccer team and I had to quit. A kind friend told me about the whole thing and she had actually told him to fuck off when he had said that.

Now, I realize I shouldn't have told him anything. But eventually he and I did run into each other a few times and he would always be kind of nice. But his friends would walk over and jokingly pull him away from talking to me. I never seeked him out or called him. Because we had so many mutual friends I just tried to be cordial. But I was constantly made to feel like I was ""crazy"", a joke, and a bother. I would usually end up being super quiet and just kind of leaving to avoid any interaction with anyone.

Because of the abusive dynamic in my family growing up, I think I became used to being looked at as a problem or a ""bad"" person. I think this is why I never told any of them to fuck off. I think this is a problem for people with CPTSD -- we are constantly re-harmed and retraumatized by people just being run of the mill assholes. We struggle to cope with every day jerks and fake friends. We are left with the blame. 

He weirdly reached out to me about 3 years ago and we talked on the phone a few times. He was super nice and we didn't bring up any of the past drama or issues. I wanted to be honest with him about how he had harmed me but I was too chicken. I was in a bad place and was just happy that he could talk to me without me feeling bad about myself.

I made a mistake this week by sending him a message on instagram basically being super cordial about it but being honest about how him calling me ""crazy"" and laughing at me had made me terrified to be honest about my past abuse with any romantic interests. I made it clear he had every right to end the relationship but calling me ""crazy"" was wrong. I ended it saying I hope he is well and I hope he has grown. I also said this was for me and not trying to rehash drama. 

He hasn't responded (which is okay I guess, it's his right to not respond). But now I'm asking myself what I thought I was going to accomplish?? He got to be shitty and now I am TERRIFIED of loving someone. I have had a few successful and unsuccessful relationships since but not found my forever partner. But why is he taking up rent in my head??? I hate that we can be retraumatized just by existing and trusting people who aren't deserving of our trust.

I struggle with social issues, it’s my most persistent trigger. My parents didn’t raise me to be human. I learned social behaviors from a culmination of TV, mimicry, my sister, my first job, and experimentation in college.

I was bullied as a kid because my family didn’t go to church and I was singled out for being odd. I though I had special powers and could talk to animals and my parents let it happen. I was socially rejected for 7 years until one new guy was like yo, y’all are being dumb. 

This lead me to be codependent AF on anyone who chose to befriends me and if you’ve seen my posts you know that ended horribly with my ex best friend.

That being said the thing I observed in my memories today is that I had to work so hard just to appear “normal” (best word in this case). I was remembering giving out Oreos on my last day in my dorm and for some reason this freaked everyone out except for the janitor. Who was very happy to get one and I’m still so thrilled. But to everyone else I must have seemed suspicious and weird. And this was in an art dorm! 

To be fair this was in my “social experimenting phase” AKA desperately trying to figure out how to interact with other human being. Stuff I should have learned in middle school. I was also just released of my abusive so I must have come off super strong and just off. A lot of people in highschool thought I was on drugs or drunk because of how dissociated and dysregulated I was.

I’ve come to a point where I’ve mostly mastered it at work. It just takes a lot of energy and I still come off as odd because my body equates social situations to fight or flight.

But at home? I don’t talk to my neighbors unless there’s some big event happening. I know it’s a city thing too most people just wasn’t to go home and avoid everyone one else. But my dad, the most awkward introvert ever was able to have a full discussing with my neighbor with no issue. I mean he come off as odd.

I just feel bad that I have to exert so much energy to talk to a person I don’t know and have no idea if they’ll perceive me as a decent human or some weird twitchy Gollum character. Yes I’ve been rejected that hard in college by someone I thought was a potential friend. I’ve even been given false numbers by a friend! It was messed up! How do you just make friends after that? 

I can only be my true self around my friends and SO and guess what? More constant anxiety and emotional flashbacks on how I’m perceived. Because of all the dang rejection in my life for being myself. I just have to trust they like me and will tell me if something is wrong.

I’m just tired man. I’m healing and still learning but I’m tired. 

If my mom had just given the effort to teach all of us kids how to be human we might be better. But she let the older ones be abused. Spoiled her boys, and tried to keep me dependent on her as long as possible.

I can't live with strangers because I have PTSD from a stranger roommate peeping tomming me then trying to murder me when I finally confronted them.

I live in an area that was ravaged by wildfires and the housing shortage is extreme. There is nowhere to go because nothing is available and the things that do become available are an impossible numbers game because so many people are homeless and desperate.

I fear being homeless not so much for myself, I've been homeless before and it sucked but I survived, but for my elderly special needs cat.

Responsibilities make me want to run and hide. As an adult I opted to become a recluse living off minimal funds, because responsibility to me = emotional trauma and pain. I am spending money I have on a therapist when I have little of it, cause I dont want to live in regret and be isolated my whole life, but its bringing up a lot of pain. Does talking about feelings with a stranger unearth memories that you never think about and had forgotten about? I've talked about stuff before with people but it's never brought up flashbacks this vivid? I'm feeling overwhelmed?

My partner loves and cares for me deeply and never intends to hurt me in any way, but he has very little understanding of social and emotional cues, and struggles with empathy. Even on a good day, when I can communicate clearly my needs and explain why I think and feel a certain way, he doesn't necessarily understand what I tell him.

Sometimes, when he does something I find triggering, I have to shut myself in a room away from him in order to feel safe enough to calm down, because I've become completely overwhelmed.

We were going from state A to state B to see family. She’d packed for me. We’d see family. And off we went.

But by the end of that day, nothing looked familiar. And the longer we drove, the less certain I was that we were headed to the family home place. I don’t remember how she acted. What we ate. What I felt. Until things were very clearly wrong.

We turned into a driveway surrounded by trees. And the sky was huge. My home state has mountains, and this one didn’t.

I protested, this isn’t where aunt lives. Where are we?

Mom reassured me. Aunt was meeting us here. Hold on, I’ll find a cat to comfort you.

The house was not one I’d ever seen.

My mom piled cats into the car and opened the kennels to release the dogs. She sat on the hood of the car. She sat on the hood of the truck. She carved something into the truck with a rock. My chest was tight.

Next I remember the police. At 7, I felt relieved. The police would help us. The police were the good guys. My mom had been, but this person wasn’t my mom.

They handcuffed her. They slid me into the back seat next to her. The bars were covered in black foam that had been picked away by previous passengers.

I sat in a small room as they asked my mom questions and handcuffed here. I was there, but I wasn’t. My body sat in the seat. My consciousness waited in the corner of the ceiling. We held hands. Mom cried. They took her away.

My next memory is a leather seat in a nice vehicle. Far nicer and newer than I’ve ever know. These people lived different than we did.

This woman, who must have been a social worker, drove me to a home. The home had a picket fence and nice wallpaper. And the children were like me. These people weren’t their parents either.

I took a bath with another little girl. A bath I don’t recall. Then I laid in bed and cried next to her through the night.

The next day I was taken to a small room. My dad was there, I was told. He would try and get custody of me. And then my memory goes blank.

Maybe for days, weeks, months, years? My mom is gone. The doctors say psychosis. They say bipolar disorder. My dad says hallucinations. 

I wonder if she sees spiders. 

The nurses give me orange juice when we visit. But who can drink orange juice in these circumstances?

Mom comes home. I move out. Mom isn’t safe anymore.

Recently, my body was flooded with these memories and the ones that follow it. I overreacted. I lashed out. Over something so small.

1253,MissingPossum,1613336463,"******LONG READ ******

So lets begin with the good. I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).

My ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. 

We never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. 

Further, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) 

I can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.

Now for what happened:

My ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.

She grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. 

My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.

So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.

First thing:

My ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. 

15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.

We go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. 

After dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.

Now fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.

I blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, ""my actions are clear and you chose them over me.""

Well we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.

Fast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.

Event 2:

Now another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: ""I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident."" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. 

I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. 

After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.
We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.

Another week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.

Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.

A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. 

The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. 

It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.

We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. 

Fast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.

Event 3:

Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. 

Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). 

She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. 

Now to the most current thing:

Still in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.

When they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.

She is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.

The next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.

2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.

A week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. 

She tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident. Yet I chose her in the accident by both supporting her and blocking my family, as well, with the abortion I was supportive of her and keeping our baby, not to mention she never brought this up ans her reasons were focused on her parents opinion and her fear of that.

Then she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. 

She removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially ""Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions"" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. 

Since our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.

I have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. 

So of course this was a long story. Sorry. But I wanted to get it out of my mind since I havent been sharing this with anyone except my therapists. 

What is your take on what has transpired? I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue :(

TLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after an accident, her abortion, and a lack of spending time together this last year.

This is a bit long, tldr at the end 

(22F) have POTS, CPTSD, gastroparesis, hypermobility (suspected hEDS, waiting to see a rheum), migraines, PCOS, asthma, and not yet diagnosed lower digestive, urinary, optical, and neurological issues that I am trying to get diagnosed. I've been waiting to see a neurologist for quite some time (since I was 13) but haven't been able to until Friday. I am also overweight which is one of the problems that came up today. In April 2020 I weighed 315 (I gained a lot of weight in my teens from my PCOS and stress) but by June I weighed 280 due to a bad gastro parents flare. Since then my weight has been slowly dropping and is now 255. My pcp and gastro docs have said to back off of loosing weight as my GP is very eradic and causes large bursts of weight loss so they predict I will loose a lot of weight without dieting in the next couple years. 

Before I get into Friday, I have PTSD from chronic child abuse until I escaped my birth mother last year, repeated sexual assault as a child, bullying, and other horrible abuse from my birth parents. I also have medical trauma from my birth mother forcing me to ignore illnesses and injuries unless it benefitted her for me to be looked at, refusal to let me see doctors on my own and insistence that I had munchausens/conversion disorder/was malingering, and medical gaslighting. There's lots more trauma im not listing bc its a lot and I am very drained right now. 

I get very nervous when I go to the doctor so my partner came with me. I get white coat syndrome fairly often (my BP is high the first couple times they check then it reads as normal) and did so again today. I was also in a lot of pain as a new flare started yesterday so I couldn't handle them trying more than twice. I apologized to the nurse and explained I was very close to having a panic attack and she replied ""well why are you gonna have a panic attack? You don't need to have a panic attack we are all good, calm down!"" so I just shut my mouth. 

The doctor finally came in and was very soft spoken, gentle seeming, but kept interrupting me to move on to a new symptom or alter my answer to a question ""no no no, not all that. Yes or no?"" which definitely set me on edge. I know I can come across as combative when I feel like I have to prove/defend myself so I was trying to stay calm and pleasant. He started asking detailed questions about my health even after I said I wasn't comfortable diving into that here and wasn't here about my mental health. He pried into my past sexual assaults and childhood trauma and later used my difficulty talking about it as evidence of conversion disorder. 

Some of the new symptoms can also be part of my already diagnosed conditions, but I'm including them bc they are flaring at different times than the other symptoms of their illness if that makes sense?
They are as follows: 
-new falling from stumbling, tripping, legs giving out, balance issues, numbness, etc
-new memory issues, luckily my partner and I both work from home so I can have a constant remembering/assistance person around. I cant seem to keep in new info unless it was VERY impactful (such as friday). I have to reread, rewatch, rehear info 6 or 7 times before it sticks for an hour. I can barely understand people half the time (masks definitely make it worse but thats ok!)
-urine retention (usually takes 4+ tries to empty my bladder) 
-pins and needles, tingling, buzzing, and numbness in my limbs. Isnt present at all times but flares often, most of my day my toes are numb)
-tunnel vision where I lose my peripheral, visual snow, involuntary eye movements which are not seizure related, increasing double vision, and smearing of everything im not directly looking at.
-increased pain and fatigue, i spent a third of January bedbound due to my body feeling too heavy to move
-none of these symptoms correlate with my mental symptoms. I am finally in a safe place with wonderful people for the first time in my life. I have a great therapist, my PTSD is getting better by the day while these other issues get worse by the day. I explained to the doc the lack of correlation. 

He did the neurological exam and handed it to me at the end to do the drawing elements. I did ok on the drawings but the memory portions where I have to remember patterns, things, etc I completely failed. He then turns to me and says he won't cancel my MRI next week and will in fact add a spinal MRI since I have so much numbness in my extremities, but then said ""it's highly likely you just have conversion disorder so I recommend finding a good therapist and starting there"". I told him I've been in therapy for 7 years, my therapist and previous psychiatrists have all said I don't have this (its a fear of mine that im crazy and making it all up but have myself convinced its real, thanks birth mom for installing so much internal gaslighting, so I have asked them if I am faking, have conversion, etc and every one has said my symptoms are real. 

I started to get upset (my partner confirms I didn't freak out, throw a fit, have a meltdown, any inappropriate emotions) and the doctor condescending said ""I can see you're getting worked up, how do you feel about this?"" So I stated that I've dealt with accusations of faking or it being in my head from my abusers so this is very stressful and upsetting. I told him I know my body and I know these issues aren't just my trauma physically manifesting, that something else is going on. He shrugged and said ""well we will have to see what the MRI says. I am hearing you, I am listening to you, I am not accusing you of malingering. Theres no need to get hysterical. ((I was not in any way hysterical, was very quiet with a quivering voice trying not to cry while still trying to advocate for myself)) However you need to accept that I am the one with the medical degree here and I say you have conversion disorder."" We left and as soon as I got to the car I just broke down. 

When I looked at his notes later I was horrified. Here as some excerpts: 

""Thank you very much for referring Ms. u/mostdelicatemoss to our office for consultation regarding complaints of vision disturbance and multiple other somatic complaints in the setting of chronic migraines, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, with multiple additional medical diagnoses including hypermobility syndrome, asthma, history of suspected POTS syndrome"" 

My chief complaints are not about my mental health. I tried to not talk about my mental health but they insisted. Also, I am diagnosed with POTS, it is not suspected. 

Multiple times in the notes he uses the phrase ""neurological or more likely somatic symptoms"", refers multiple times to the fact that im visibly overweight, and failed to note multiple symptoms. For example I was having lots of difficulty finding words and kept slurring, but he noted perfect speech without delays or impediment. He also noted no tremors when my right hand was tremoring the whole time and he commented on it to me. 

His final notes/treatment plan: 

""1.Multiple somatic/neurologic complaints (in a young woman with history of remote sexual and physical and emotional abuse, ongoing issues with depression, anxiety, PTSD), including complaints of generalized weakness, intermittent (( NOT INTERMITTENT )) diplopia, peripheral bilateral upper and lower limb paresthesias, episodes of more significant weakness thought to be possibly due to hemiplegic migraines, declining memory and cognitive function, Reproducible intermittent tunneling of vision associated with prolonged staring at a target, gait instability (presented in a wheelchair), generalized fatigue, among other issues as detailed above. 

Examination and history are felt to be highly suspicious for probable conversion reaction. Additional testing will be completed to rule out the very small possibility of underlying neurologic disorder such as multiple sclerosis or other central demyelinating syndrome. Given history of intermittent diplopia and denies weakness, will also check myasthenia panel, CPK, and ESR levels. Given complaints of paresthesias in the upper and lower limbs, will pursue some limited vitamin levels as detailed above. MRI imaging will be completed of the brain and cervical spine to rule out MS. 

 #2. Intractable migraine headaches, with and without aura, with history of both episodic and chronic migraine, history of status migrainosus, previously diagnosed hemiplegic migraines. Complicated by suspicion for conversion reaction. Managed by headache clinic at this time. ((I rarely get migraines, they come after I've had a period or a virus and I only have maybe 4 periods a year. They do not correlate with stress or my mental health)) 

 #3. Long-standing psychiatric history including PTSD, history of childhood abuse, depression, anxiety, history of previously diagnosed dissociative disorder, history of previously diagnosed ""auditory processing disorder"", dyslexia,history of previously diagnosed ""ADHD"", history of eating disorder. Followed by behavioral health services with regular psychiatric appointments. (( why does he mark these diagnoses as ~previously diagnosed~ when he marks multiple of my just as validly diagnosed physical diagnoses as just suspected dx's? )) 

 #4. Asthma, increased BMI, polycystic ovarian syndrome, question possible POTs (( again that is diagnosed )) Disease, among other issues as detailed above, further complicating medical decision-making process. 

 #5. Multifocal myalgias, previously thought to have possible fibromyalgia, question possible hypermobile joint syndrome. (( this is the dx I have but my PCP thinks its hEDS. So again, not possible but already known. )) "" 

Why did he refer to things in this way? I feel like he was invasive about my trauma, ignored 80% of what I said, and weaponised my trauma against me to accuse me of being crazy/hysterical in the most condescending way. 

Am I crazy? Is this conversion and im just blind? Was I super out of line? Why did he talk to me this way and phrase everything like this? Where do I go from here? I'm scared to see him again bc unless the MRI finds something I think he is going to formally dx me with conversion disorder and I don't want that. If thats what I have id like a couple more opinions before its official as I know it will prevent me from ever being taken seriously by a dr again. 

TLDR 

Dr asked invasive trauma questions and says I have conversion disorder. I strongly disagree and want another opinion but idk where to go or what to do from here. Won't every doc just dismiss me now or latch onto the conversion thing? Was he actually rude/off base or am I overreacting?

1256,DeadWolffiey,1613334994,"TW: Mention of sexual assault and self harm.

The start of Jan I had a mental breakdown with stress seizures due to being untreated for a long while. It was my second one in 3 years where I was pulled from work and could barely leave the house. I was getting help with my first one, but I was kicked out, when into an abusive relationship and had a rape baby. I worked my ass off to provide for my child and didn't leave time to heal myself... And I paid the price for it. I had a mental breakdown. It started at work. I was working and it hit, like I had realized something. I had the overwhelming urge to run away and disappear. I started crying, pacing, shaking and needed to leave. Everyday I came in I barely lasted an hour because I would breakdown sobbing at everyone and anything. Simple tasks where the hardest. My manager had to pull me every morning to talk to me about my mental health. So. I went on a leave.

The first couple of weeks I had nonstop stress dreams about work as well as nightmares. The days I was supposed to work I was a panicked mess, barely able to function in the day. I self harmed. I could barely get out of bed.  I had to call support hotlines just because I left the house. 

Though, I took the steps and go back on medication. I have therapy starting this week. I've also been self medicating with cannabis to help with my nightmares. I'm slowly doing better with my breakdown. Even to the point where I went into my store (Wal-Mart) for the first time in over a month when in the past at the start, just thinking about going in there would cause me to breakdown and cry. While, yes, there were points I wanted to cry and I dissociated. I was able to push through it and finish what we needed to do.

I'm 27, and have never been in a romantic relationship. I have also never had sex. My parents had an extremely bad marriage &amp; divorce, after which my mom married my abusive stepdad. In some ways I feel like... like it's my responsibility to always be alone.

1260,PootinScootin69,1613332190,"I’ve been going over and over a situation that happened a few days ago and there’s one thing I did that I’m really proud of. 

For context, I am a mid 40s lady who is single lives on a sailboat in Mexico. I know, it sounds awesome. Usually it is!  It that also means I’m constantly put in the girlfriend zone by literally anyone and everyone. I’m very avoidant and I just don’t do romantic relationships. I was on tinder last fall and was talking to a guy who happened to work where I live occasionally. 

I should not hace given him my number, but I did. He kept pushing for it, red flag #1. Well, I realized a couple days into texting he is just all over the place and has no boundaries whatsoever. He kept inviting himself over, and that is am absolute no go for me. I told him I think we wanted different things and wished him the best. 

He started making fun of me saying I clearly misunderstood. Rather than argue with him I blocked him via WhatsApp. Then he texted me thru SMS “Don’t be rude to me” OH HELL NO. I told him “Please leave me alone” and blocked him on my phone too. I was worried for months he’d come find me, bu eventually forgot. I’d even saved the text messages for proof, but needed to make space on my phone so I recently deleted them. 

I was outside working on a complicated and dangerous project if not done correctly, and I hear “heyyy!” 

I look over and I’m trying to register who this person is... and it’s *him*. From then on I never took my eyes off him. I can’t remember if I had my sunglasses on or not, but I definitely froze and didn’t know what to say or do. He asked if I remembered him and in a slightly annoyed tone I said “I do....” he said “oh I was just working on (points to a boat behind me way at the end of another dock) that boat and wanted to come by and say hi!” 

As if we’re best friends?! As if there’s an expiration date to “please leave me alone”?

I said “ok....” and he left and i went back to my project. 

But what I keep praising myself for is not looking away. This man clearly has boundary issues, and honestly a lot of men have boundary issues when it comes to the whole boat thing. It’s like all the norms are tossed out the window and it really sucks sometimes. Whether he was trying to distract me to get me to look away to he could jump on board, who knows. Unlikely,  it I didn’t give him the chance to. 

I’ve started wearing mace as a necklace, I know it looks ridiculous but it looks like a flashlight so whatever I’d rather have it on me when I’m outside. I’m also thinking about creating a folder on my laptop for “bad memories” so if this happens again I can save the evidence but not be subjected to seeing it constantly when looking through my phone / messages for something unrelated.

When I apologise to someone, it isn't something unhealthy or a type of manipulation tactic. It isn't because I want to bring everyone's mood down and form a pity party. It's because for me, when I feel I have done something wrong, it makes me feel relaxed and happier after apologising. 

And so when people I care about say, ""we spoke about this, stop apologising all the time"" it makes me feel rubbish as this is a part of my personality that can't simply be destroyed. It isn't a bad habit or a negative trait. I'm just an empath... or at least inside I am. 

Wish apologising was seen more as a kind gesture or a symbol of caring, instead of a negative habit that needs to be eradicated. I know apologising can be used as a way to manipulate, so I don't wish to ever brush this under a rug or minimise the severity of how things can be. 

I just wish for those who have that as a part of their personality. That it isn't shamed so much by others, especially when it helps to relieve anxiety and comes from the heart.

1270,phmmsiano,1613325654,"But, tried it for the first time on Friday after months and months of counseling, and I honestly think it has helped!

We focused on an event thats been causing me guilt from right before we found out my son had brain cancer. In talking with a co-worker that day after work, I mentioned to them that my child had an MRI that evening. My son had been sick for months, and the doctors were finally starting to listen to my concerns (dad was reporting the opposite of whatever I did, so medpros had a hard time determining how to proceed). I knew something was wrong, and I think in the back of my brain, I knew it was something serious. So, I said to my friend just before leaving, ""watch it be a tumor or some shit"", half-jokingly, half-scared shitless that it was a possibility. Surprise! A few hours later, sitting in the MRI room, the nurse tells me to go talk to the doctor on the phone. This is the point where I compartmentalized, intellectualized. The part where my emotions could *not* get in the way of helping my son through whatever may come. And I believe these coping mechanisms allowed me to fully present throughout my son's surgeries, hospital stays, and treatments to date. It allowed me to be the mom my kid needed - explain everything, be his comfort, his rock, and absorb everything I could from the medical professionals. I handled my son's diagnosis and subsequent challenges like a fucking boss, thanks to my coping mechanisms.

Before starting EMDR, my guilt surrounding his diagnosis was about 5/10. My therapist helped me break down why I feel guilty. Logically, I know I didn't speak the tumor into existence. Logically, I know I did everything I thought was right at the time. But, I struggled with thoughts about how I should have pushed harder. Should have made someone pay attention.

I also learned that I want so bad to be absolutely pissed at the medical professionals for brushing me off for months. I acknowledge that they did their best to decipher the information coming from myself and my child's father, but had I not pushed hard at the end, they wouldn't have done enough.

Ultimately, they did the best they could and so any blame I want to aim at them I've ended up redirecting at myself.

Before EMDR, I already believed I did the best I could for my kid, but the guilt hurt. 

After EMDR, I know I did the best I could, I was my child's advocate, and my guilt is not probably 1.5/10.


I plan to do EMDR again to help with other traumas. Overall, I think it was the right move for my mental health.


Aside: i felt so silly not being able to keep moving my eyes side to side rapidly. Pretty sure only one eye worked some of the time, and I'm pretty sure i went cross-eyed regularly. Even had a a funny thought about how maybe *I* have a brain tumor. Ugh.

Additionally, EMDR made me realize just *how much* stress I've been holding in my shoulders, neck, and jaw. The jaw tension has actually cause my jaw to have issues locking, which I'm seeing a dentist for. Stress is a killer!

Learning about cptsd was like a bittersweet realization. I always knew there was something not right with me. I think my first dissociation moment was at 9 (26 now). And since 21 my cycles of depression and isolation gotten worse, they used to take 2-3 months to get out of, now they're hitting the 7month mark. I had problems with substances mainly alcohol and mj, went to a rehab like 3 times thinking that drugs were my problem. Or when I went to the psych ward for severe depression and dissociation. All these attempts caused me more harm down the road, cuz the core problem would never be addressed and would be left with solutions that went no where. Which then doubles the shame because I blame myself for not benifiting from that help, which made me sometimes more hopeless. The dissociation which is the freeze response is my biggest problem to overcome that and the toxic shame, they're my biggest obstacles to opening up. Because always at my most vulnerable when I did open up and share it was met by invalidation or minimizing which then makes me feel dumb or very weak and feeling humiliated. Or I get enraged by their insensitivity when they asked in the first place.

And with my extreme dissociation my identity is fragmented inside and I feel like I'm loosing my life.
I've been isolated since last September and that has took a great toll on my overall integration. Social events are almost impossible interactions are so scary. I'm in therapy rn and want to sign up for a group therapy to interact with people on my same lvl I think to get out of my shame complex slowly.

One last thing, does anyone else have severe dissociation to the point u feel like there's multiple people inside you. Like there's this positive spiritual persona who sounds like he got it together and is likable acceptable. And the other feels so inferior that there's no hope. I think the latter is my innerchild.

😱😱😱

I never imagined that that would ever happen. 

Ever.

But it did. And... i've learned a lot about my condition. That other family members and the community we lived in contributed. That my later experiences with abuse contributed. That my own choices later in life contributed... and fuck me if I didn't realize that... I've stopped wanting to punish her. To make her pay, to rub her nose in the mess she made or force her to confess. I'm so very tired... i just want to get better. And her asking that was so genuine and out of the blue... i didn't want to quash it.

So i was brutally honest with us both, as gently as possible. I told her that my CPTSD treatment considers primary childhood caregivers,  social environment and community, and later trauma. That for decades i have walled off emotions i wasn't allowed to experience at home, church, anywhere- that the bible said being angry was like murder. That as a child i literally tried to kill any part of me i thought was my ""sin nature"". That after years of therapy and working through an ocean of pain we discovered a lifetime of anger cementing to rage underneath it and now, at 35, i'm learning to process and manage my anger at a child's level. That it's exhausting and scary and i have a support network and meds help and... it is what it is. 

This is the reply i got some hours later:

""I feel like I need to apologize. I wasn't allowed to show anger or resentment or disappointment or any negative emotions. That doesn't mean i didn't have or feel them, I just wasn't allowed to show, ""wallow"", act on or express those feelings.

I didn't realize I allowed that pattern of injustice to continue in my life to my children.""

I still want to have a relationship with her but it's hard. Whenever I want to reveal to her that my childhood wasn't as rosy of a picture as she paints it to others, she does the whole ""Oh, well, I guess I'm just a terrible mother"" thing, making it impossible to have a constructive or insightful conversation.

Is this even worth pursuing? I sometimes question the purpose of digging up the past and showing her my perspective. ""It would just make her upset,"" I think to myself... And yet, I can't stop thinking about having this conversation with her. I think it's coming from a sense of wanting to clear the air between us, although it is mostly one sided with myself being the one harboring unresolved feelings. 

I just can't look at her the same. The illusion of a nuturing mother has been shattered. How can I see her in any other light? Why is it when she expresses pride in me, her daughter, all I feel is disgust? Is it repulsion that she would claim pride in something she doesn't deserve? Or is it that lingering, deep-seated insecurity that's clinged to me since childhood? I think it's a combination of the two.

Needless to say, I feel like I'm being denied a critical part of my healing or moving on with my life when my mother refuses to acknowledge the damage that she had inadvertently woven into me. I say inadvertantly because I do not believe that she had malicious intent while she was raising me. She was just utterly depressed and alone and not in a good headspace.

1291,Greasey_Guy,1613315210,"I've always felt distanced from others -  I would feel out of place playing with the other kids when I was little, I would be mocked all throughout school, I worked at a young age, thus causing a resentment towards capitalism, yet I could never escape it along with death, so I became very nhilistic. I had developed into a somewhat sick, mean, and careless individual in middle school (even too mean and nihilistic for your average middleschooler), doing shit that like wearing paper on my face with self-directed hate speech written on it just to get the thrill of receiving dirty looks. I took a strange and euphoric joy in self-deprecation and self torment - something that would grow like a tumor. In the summer of 8th grade, I had receded away from my ""friends"", becoming lonely and indulging myself in music to take my mind off of my loneliness. Music had become my passion, and I swiftly became good at guitar. Once high school rolled around, I had become so emotionally distant from everyone else that I was separated from everyone else. There was a mental block between me and everyone else. The girls would laugh together in groups, boys would make fun of each other, smart students would cooperate to knock down high homework amounts together, but I was separated from everyone else; I was the weird guy who sat in the back wearing shades and etching down whatever musical thoughts popped into my heads, like riff and lyrical ideas - I was and still am the outcast music nerd.

I always feared sex, which was induced by my mother putting her loathing and spite for sex into me from a young age. In middle and high school, the other boys would talk about how they found a girl so hot, girls would talk about how ripped a guy was, and shit like that, but I always felt disgusted by the sexualization and objectification of someone else. In middle school, when I felt horny, I would feel repulsed with myself and masturbate until I was physically unable to do so anymore, thus accidentally associating my hatred for sex with the act of sexual pleasure, so it grew into a cycle of lust leading to self pleasure, which lead to self hatred, thus making me masturbate more, thus making me hate myself more, yadda yadda. Eventually, I managed to beat the horniness out of myself, and I am unable to get horny - my genitals function, but my brain has been retrained to stop getting horny, which I don't even think is humanly possible.

In high school, I would grow romantic, non-sexual crushes on girls I watched from across the classrooms (kind of creepy, I know), but when I tried to make the moves, I was either too socially awkward to effectively express myself or in a pit of guilt for feeling these feelings, towards women, which is another phenomenon: I've always had an odd respect for women, subconsciously viewing them as being above me for having a vagina, so when I felt romantic attraction to girls, I felt I was unworthy, and when combined with the sheer amount of hatred I had for myself, I felt like I was insulting women for even having the mere thought of being in a relationship with one.

When I did effectively approach girls, however, I struck like a dagger; I would make small talk about what they liked and were interested in, judging by their clothing, accidentally overhearing their other conversations, etc. I would make decent friendships in a very disturbingly inhuman and sociopathic manner, observing them and formulating a plan in my head of what to say and respond with, boiling them and their responses down to numbers and variables, something that made me feel even more disconnected with everyone else, thus hating myself somehow even more and making me feel guilty for turning women into algorithms. I would then stop talking to these people completely, receding back into my self by ignoring them and cutting them off entirely (not a very wise chocie).

The guilt I felt for what my brain thought was me hurting women materialized itself into a twisted fantasy in which I was brutally beaten by all the girls that I think I have ever wronged, with each of them beating me to a pulp one at a time in a specific setting and style tailored to said girl. This recurring fantasy of self-punishment felt and still feels so right, yet I know it isn't normal, but the euphoric freedom I feel from it is absurd; I feel like I'm free of my guilt and self hatred, for I was served justice. I feel as though I was rightfully punished for my wrongdoings and evil deeds, but when I remember that my fantasy isn't reality, I swiftly return to my state of depression and self spite. Ever since the birth of this morbid fantasy a couple years ago, I have wanted nothing more than to be beaten up by a woman, with her serving as the one who will bring justice to all those I have wronged. It sounds so fucked up when I write it out, but in my head, it feels correct.

My self tormenting and self hatred only grew, which caused me to write song after song about how much I hate my self and/or the world - about how much nothing I did and will do matters. While the lyrics and meanings were mostly edgy trash, they all sounded pretty good, with my standout one being an unofficial song, titled, ""Lord of the Horseflies"", a song about how, ""there may be a fork in the road, but in the long run,  every path that we take will only lead to one"". Needless to say, it was about nihilism, as well as having a strong verse and chorus melody, accompanied with two badass guitar solos. The fact that you can't find it on YouTube or Soundcloud shows the progress I've made with it, though, along with all of my other hundreds of unfinished works.

The sheer amount of disgust I had for myself wasn't aided my unfortunate home life either. I lived in a shit hole with a drunken father and overbearing and over emotional mother. The moment I realized just how much I truly despised my home life was on my 15th birthday. My parents and my unemployed sister began arguing over politics, which swiftly turned violent, with objects being destroyed, doors being unhinged and shouts echoing through the house; I then spent next couple hours of the night sobbing in my room. My mother came to not make me feel better or provide comfort, but to persuade me that she was right; she revealed all the cheating that my father had done and that they both wanted a divorce, but she refused to let him go. She would go from talking quietly to yelling to sobbing and so forth, all the while telling me what a worm my father is. She made me feel guilty for not siding with her, as I sided with nobody. I felt more alone that night than I have ever felt in my entire life; I cried myself to sleep, woke up, and I had to go to school the next day as though nothing had happened. I felt disgusted with my self for acting so cowardly, thus causing me to hate myself even more.

Well, those were the major chunks and parts of my life, with me now being out of highschool, but still feeling the same; I still hate myself just as much, if not more than I did. Not once have I cut myself, though, and I will retain the will and strength not to do so! I believe I am one strangely fucked individual with a somewhat self-aware and diluted perception of reality, but is there anything any of you can relate to? While I don't know if this constitutes as PTSD, I can certainly say a lot of the events were traumatic to me.

1304,3thirtyeight8,1613307652,"I am in a successful long-term relationship. We both are not the greatest mental-health wise, and whereas I tend to internalise and dissociate, they show their emotions very externally and vocally. 

The issue is that, when they are in a bad state and need help, they end up very volatile and unpredictable, which I don't deal with well. There is sudden shouting and aggressive movements. My automatic instinct is to tense up and expect that I will be hit or something. It annoys me that this is my reaction, as I know they won't do this. It makes my partner worse too as they think I don't trust them. 

They always say the anger is directed at themselves, but when it's happening it is true that it is about themselves technically, but still feels directed at me e.g. ""I am a terrible person how can you stand me, why cant you take the bad away, why don't you hurt me I deserve it"", you get the gist. And I am so stressed to answer as the wrong answer can make things worse, but not answering also makes things worse. However, when I am stressed, I often get into a state where I can't/struggle to speak or do things. I get overwhelmed and completely shut down to everything. So I am simultaneously having to save my partner while trying to not allow myself to escape from intense stress. I have to help them or they can start hurting themselves, but if they hurt me (accidentally, from me restraining them), this also makes things worse. There are lots of other factors to it, but this is already getting long. 

I am not good at helping emotionally, I give people logical solutions. I am autistic and so struggle to know their emotion (I always assume anger, it really seems like anger to me), and do not always react ""appropriately"" (say the ""wrong"" thing, feel the ""wrong"" way, don't show much expression etc.).

Before anyone says the relationship is bad, this isnt an everyday occurance. Literally everything else is good. We are very close and share everything with each other and I honestly don't think I'd still be here if it wasn't for them. In some ways this doesn't help when they are in a bad mood as it feels like they have gone and that the foundation I base my life on is suddenly not there. I hope that makes some sort of sense...

I don't actually know if I have c-ptsd and cannot access a therapist anytime soon, but I recently think much of my reaction could be linked to how my mother was, aka: extremely emotionally unstable, constant shouting and why my instinct is that I will be hit.

So sometimes a little piece of memory comes back which I, back then, thought was normal parentbehaviour. And now I think about it and see that it was utterly ridiculous and nobody should treat a child like that.
When I was about 11 years old, I broke my leg and spent some time with a cast around my full leg (ankle to hip). Anyone who has never had anything cast; your muscles  degenerate VERY fast, meaning that once you get out of the cast you cant properly use them. Meaning for me that I couldnt bend my leg or even make walking movements. My leg was ""just there"". 
So, once the doctors took my cast of my dad was there with me. I had to go to another room to see another doctor, but I had a lot of trouble getting off the bed because my leg wouldnt fucking work. Now, if I had a kid I would help them out getting off that bed, to the next room, tell them its okay or even get a wheelchair somewhere to help them out.
My dad got angry with my claiming that I could definitely walk and should grow up and stop whining. I honestly struggled on my legs and could barely move forward without falling over. Yet he didn't help me, not in any way. I was upset about him being angry with me and I felt like he was right and I was just being overdramatic. I literally was 11, in a super vulnerable moment at the hospital, my leg got fucked up earlier and I couldnt put any weight on it whatsoever.
I dont know why this all of a sudden occured to me again, but damn, who treats a child like that? Or am I in the wrong? I justed wanted to write this down and share it.

1312,Vessecora,1613301219,"Ever since I can remember I've been having small episodes of what was eventually diagnosed as epileptic seizures. They presented with jamais vu (things not seeming familiar even though they rationally are), reduced state of consciousness, light-headedness, and inability to speak or only managing gibberish. I have to have a medical certificate to drive even though I haven't had a seizure in nearly 3 years. 

I've had an EEG which showed very little activity and the neurologist was hesitant to prescribe medication but ultimately did due to the reported symptoms. I was on carbamazepine for 2 years without 100% success before we decided to discontinue it due to lack of seizures. But of course there's always the fear that the seizure type might change to grand mal etc. 

I've begun seeing a psychologist in the last 3 years who has helped me realise that I've been dissociating since 2011 due to incestuous sexual abuse. Now 2011 wasn't the first time I experienced trauma since my mother died slowly of lung cancer when I was 6. My father was out of the picture. Before her death we were practically homeless with drugs involved. And God knows how I was actually treated since I can't remember - the info I do have came from slips from my grandparents. They took me in after my mother's death and never spoke about her. So I've come to realise that I was probably not doing as well as I thought I was...

So come to now when my psychologist mentions that she isn't sure that the seizures are epilepsy. I've been struggling to even consider the idea just because it almost feels less validating, which I imagine is due to stigma. Though I suppose it would explain why the seizures feel almost... Good. Better than reality.

1314,Shodidoren,1613300873," ~~Alright first of all I'm on mobile and I don't see any trigger warning  flairs, wouldn't know which one to choose tbh, I'm personally not into  that stuff but to each their own. It says nightmare in the title  \*shrug\*.~~ Back on PC mobile wouldn't post.

So I had a nightmare in the form of a false awakening,  think light sleep paralysis. I rarely have those and mostly when I seek  out lucid dreaming intentionally. For those who don't know a false  awakening is when you think you wake up in your bed but you're actually  still sleeping. Pretty self explanatory.

A bit of context -  there were other dreams before it like an old best friend moving to  Germany to get a fun festival job there where I felt left out. This  corresponds to our university experience (he didn't really move to  Germany tho). Another one was my dad entering my room without permission  (does that all the time) and criticizing me on some sloppy jeans on the  chair and me shoving him out calling him a fascist lol. Both parents  have criticized the living crap out of me every day since forever,  sometimes &gt;100 times a day. Still living with them unfortunately.

So  then I have this false awakening where I 'm lying on my right side of  the bed and my mom comes over and starts to snuggle. At this point I'm  feeling uncomfortable, much like in real life.

Now  to clear things up there was no sexual context. No such experiences as  far as I remember. It felt more like fear of intimacy blah blah blah I'm  such a hardass blah blah. I can hug other people -not them- but a  certain fear of intimacy persists. Note this is a cerebral analysis, I  don't really know what feeling that was, it just felt like fear.

So  I have this fine idea while nightmaring of exercising my IFS therapist  privileges and going all in on this bitch. Again for context, I'm early  in the therapy process, still only learning about protectors (Jay Early)  and I don't have or can afford a therapist. Plus I'm not sure I can  find one in my area that's trained. That said I'm pretty enthusiastic  about doing it myself, I'm very logical and not afraid to move fast and  test/break things.

I figure this feeling of  fear and effort to escape is a protector. Don't know much about exiles  or how to handle protectors, I'm just yoloing instinctively at this  point. As some of you know IFS is a non-pathologizing form of therapy so  at this point I'm trying to accept the feeling as a useful, if  pathological, part of me, unconditionally. I make sure to let the part  know, while she's still hugging me.

This is where the shit hits the fan. Oh boy.

I've  been lurking on some psychedelic subreddits (shroom, lsd, dmt, never  had either) and there was a dude describing how a bad trip on an  overdose can feel like the wrath of God weighing down on you like an  angry fist.

I immediately get pressure points  all over the left side of my body, about the size of a ping pong ball.  Mind you I'm super NOT kinaesthetic, my internal world is imagery &amp;  instinct along with some emotion in my head, intense body sensations only  come when I'm angry or severely anxious (rare). I'm a master  dissociator.

The sensation is not painful per  se, but extremely powerful. Overwhelmingly, suffocatingly powerful. It's  pushing me downwards like the hand of God. There's a feeling of intense  desperation, like the feeling you've drank too much and you have a  nightful of vomiting ahead of you. Actually had a similar feeling last  time I tried pot. It was like the 15th time or so but first time I had  bad physical side effects. Not a fan of the drug overall, probably won't  do it again.

Then I remember grimacing like I'm wailing while being completely paralyzed by the sensation. And then I woke up. Wakey wakey.

So  yeah. That's it. I'm feeling great now and don't regret accessing that  part. It was a lot to chew on at one time I guess but again, don't mind  testing my limits.

If you're looking for a  therapeutic system and are interested in IFS I recommend checking it  out. Some people require a therapist as it's too overwhelming for them  even in an awake state.

If you have had similar experiences or just looking to shoot the shit leave a comment below. Thanks for reading!

On the other side, tiny, tiny triggers like a smell or a tiny mental connection I made, I can put down to neurology so in my mind its ""legit""

But there are some that I am just so wildly embarrassed by. Someone I dated a couple of times told me they needed more time to heal from their past relationship and broke things off - but I noticed they had updated their dating profile... Its not my business, they might have told a white lie to spare my feelings that they just weren't interested, etc. Honestly, I had also updated my profile since they broke it off. This is all just normal parameters of human behaviour. 

But just seeing that profile update - and I certainly wasn't obsessing by any means, literally just noticed their picture had changed - absolutely overwhelmed me. I had to take days off sick. I was flooded, in crisis, migraine, insomnia, shaking, fever and chills, sweating, crying, trying to exist from second to second because the pain was too much... But it's not about a profile picture, is it?

I have to be sure to connect it back to what has happened before in my life - this is about a sense of being fundamentally unwanted, fundamentally too flawed to be around others, easily discarded, easily swapped out for someone else, never quite good enough no matter how hard I try... Easily discarded. That's the one I come back to. Easily discarded and completely alone with no resources. 

The normal parameter for this dating scenario would be to feel disappointed. Like, that's it. Only dated twice, disappointment would be the appropriate response.

I live on unemployment, with a medical certificate, and don't have money for necessities. Money is a factor in the equation because DBT is government funded whereas the trauma therapy may not be. 

I had a really terrible experience with a government funded counselling service from a scheme for victims of crime. The therapy was phone meetings only. At first I thought it was going really well, but I had a pretty severe episode and things suddenly turned. The situation wasn't handled well, and beginning that therapy caused unbearable pain. 

Being completely isolated is also a factor. I have three hours of assistance a week, plus a case manager. Otherwise I am alone, mostly in bed. I'm terrified that it will happen again. The intense flashbacks, the voices in my head, the fear. Even now I'm afraid to go anywhere, sensory things are becoming harder and harder. I don't have anyone to support me through the process. If I can't do something, I don't. If I can't afford something, I go without. I really don't want to lose my independence and freedom, I don't want to be so far inside the system that I'm trapped. 

Anyways, I am beginning DBT. I understand the importance of skills and teaching my brain to live differently. I want to do the program and I've even attempted DBT in the past. But aren't my behaviors inherently tied to the trauma? I'm supposed to be documenting some pretty extreme behaviors. But what about everything behind those behaviors? Asking me to tick off if I feel suicidal, if I self-harmed, if I've isolated. It asks me to record my fear, anxiety, anger and shame. I just don't understand how this is helpful, I don't understand how this is the only treatment. 

But then, there is a part of me that is unable to truly accept the trauma. It's like there's this wall in my mind, and behind it is all the pain that I would have to feel if I walked through it. But I can't, really. I'm scared of all that pain.

I couldn't bare being myself so for a little while I became someone different. I kept saying ""the other guy (me) is sleeping"" everytime I tried to get my mind back to normal. It felt like I went to sleep, and put a different person up front to navigate my body. 

The paranoia is what's killing me. I was driving in my car the other night, and stared screaming in terror because I thought I saw something sitting in the back seat. Being alone in my car at night freaked me out. I'm so lonely, and tired. I get jelous of people for being able to do the things that I can't. It's like a paranoid jelousy filled with rage that's hard to control. I'm so tired. I'm afraid that I'm going to hurt myself. I don't feel like doing it right now but when I start to flip out it becomes highly possible. I'm scared for tomorrow. I'm scared for Valentines day. Ive been dreading Valentines since Christmas. I don't want to hurt myself because I'm lonely.

1334,MediumChemist,1613282462,"The first coping mechanism I used as a child was isolation. Being alone and hiding from other humans insured that I was safe. But it also insured that I didn't experience a healthy amount of social interaction, or created functioning patterns on social situations. As a result I am developmentally arrested in this area, which I think is a much harsher symptom than the original symptoms I was coping from with isolation. Social interaction is a fundamental part of what it means to being human, and if my brain is wired to not feel safe around others, the path of least resistance is to isolate, and therefor missing out on a large portion of that aspect. I've been using reparenting methods to slowly teach myself that it's safe to participate socially, but that old pattern is always just around the corner, waiting for the first trigger to demand it's necessity again.

When I was 15 I started using substances to cope. I started with alcohol and soon progressed to weed. I was a daily user for many years. Eventually harder drugs came into the picture. Luckily I didn't abuse them too much, I just wanted to escape from the pain, I disliked being too high to function properly, as I always needed to feel in control and able to mobilize quickly in case of potential danger. I would trip alone sometimes, and while I had enlightening experiences, I also had horrible, dark and panicky ones that left me rattled for days. I also experimented with some obscure research chemicals that might have left a mark. The biggest notable side effect of the substances was another developmental arrest. I had depended on substances since I was 15 to escape from my pain, so when I stopped taking them I realized I have never actually developed the capacity to regulate my emotions naturally... The first year after I quit was full of anxiety, fear and restless nights. I got triggered like 1o times a day, and it took all my energy to keep going and practice self-regulation. Since then I've progressed a lot. I still get triggered, but not as strongly and it lasts not nearly as long.

Currently I'm going through a bit of the winter SAD blues, and I've been noticing the gradual accumulation of negative side effects as a direct result of my current coping mechanisms. I see once again the coping mechanisms are worse than actually facing and dealing with the pain, in fact it's the source of more pain and thus creating a vicious cycle to the bottom. It's difficult to try and balance this with not feeling guilty and beating myself up for coping, it saved my life in the past, but perhaps it's now time to do the painful thing of letting it go.",CPTSD,I feel like a huge percentage of my trauma is a result of my coping mechanisms that I used to cope with the original childhood trauma.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ljiq2s/i_feel_like_a_huge_percentage_of_my_trauma_is_a/,1613253662.0
1335,SilentTempestLord,1613281680,"As a teenager going through highschool, I've been struggling with keeping myself from breaking down in public. Having Autism already makes emotions extremely difficult for me as is, but after I went through the ringer with my grandparents, it's been far, far worse. And this month hasn't been much better for me. 

My first breakdown of the month was with my mother. I was doing the dishes as I usually did, but then I had the same flashbacks that kept haunting me since my family left my grandparents. I remembered my brother being beaten because he had been a little too playful. I remembered the times when me and my mother was insulted and harassed because ""we weren't actual family members."" It all came back, and I remember yelling ""goddammit,"" the swear word I had always said when I was having flashbacks. I collapsed onto the counters, crying. It was just too much. I am still grateful that she actually understood, and she managed to get me to calm down enough to talk about it. It was such a relief. 

The next time it happened, I was with a group of friends at lunch, and it happened again. Once again, I said ""goddammit,"" and I friend I had grown very close to realized what was going on. He had seen it happen before. He lead me to an unoccupied part of the high school, where I could cry in piece. After I came back 10 minutes later, I still had tears in my eyes, but I had gotten myself under control once again. They asked what was wrong, and my friend replied ""PTSD."" I was soo afraid they would abandon me. But to my relief, they actually allowed me to vent out what was going on. They even went out of their way to find a private area to talk about. I could never be more grateful. 

The third time was with my dad. And he was not as accepting. I broke down while talking with him, and his first instinct was religion. And I just snapped. The people that had traumatized me as used religion as their excuse. And he said that ""I could just get over it if I forgot it."" I can't just forget it goddammit! I have been trying to do that for 3 fucking years now! And it hasn't worked! I snapped at him, and I slammed the door behind me as I went to my room, crying myself to sleep. 

The fourth time was with my P.E. teacher. But he instantly knew what was the problem. I had not known this about him before, but he was also teaching former soldiers to readapt to normal life. And he would often have times where a soldier would have problems with PTSD. So when he say me start to break down in the middle of class, he immediately allowed me to enter the locker room to be by myself. He had the other teacher in the class take over while he talked with me. And it was a moment of relief. I didn't say what exactly had happened, but he allowed me to let it all out, to discuss what I was struggling with. He excused me for the rest of class so that I could be alone.

I only like scary movies that do not involve my triggers (prolonged intentional infliction of pain on a human being). I cannot watch anything with torture or I'll puke so I just avoid any and all media even slightly hinting at torture. But horror films in general are like a type of drug for me. When there's a jump and it makes me scream, I laugh and scream at the same time and it's exhilarating like jumping out of a plane.

Last night was supposed to be a fun night, but it ended in a bad hangover, no sleep, very ill and feeling absolutely depressed. My partner had to go to work, and i laid in bed for hours, crying - feeling so alone. Today was supposed to be a good day. I wanted it to be a good day so bad. But one by one the thoughts rolled in and I couldnt stop them.

I felt like, what kind of life is a life where everyday, i dont know if its going to be good or if its going to be bad. The thought, that my partner would have to suffer alongside me, unbearable. And after the tears stopped, came the emptiness. The person staring back at me in the mirror, she isnt me.

After i was able to briefly ground myself, i knew i had to message my partner even though i so desperately wanted to hide that I wasnt okay. And i am so thankful i did. 

He reminded me of my journey, all my small victories and the big battles ive conquered my whole life. He told me that i dont have to face every battle on my own anymore, that we have a plan and its going to take time, but thats okay. And that its okay, to not be okay. 

I wanted so desperately to pick myself up after our conversation, go to work, clean the house, just be okay. But i wasnt. And for once in my life, i told myself thats okay. 

When my partner came home, he surprised me with a beautiful boutique of flowers. I have never gotten flowers ever before in my life. 

I cried, and for once, i was okay to not be okay. While these moments are few and far between, i am so thankful for my partner.

1356,Spiderpig-III,1613272657,"I will try to keep a very long story short.

I am a 41yo male from Australia. 
I had quite an abusive childhood.
Moved into a very dangerous profession and was exposed violent supervisors etc etc over 10 years.
For the 8years prior I was victim of domestic violence, perpetrated by 2 family members.

I found out that one of the perpetrators had physically struck my wife at a young age and made her lie to authorities. Up until this point, I could not work out why my wife protected the person that was harming both of us.

I realised that this person had taken so much from our life, not because she loved this man but was afraid of him.

I challenged this man on his behaviour and he tried to punch me, which was totally uncalled for. I refrained from entering into a physical altercation and reported him to the police.

Once I realised how much ruin my life was in due to a man that hits women; I became manic.

I was taken to the hospital and stopped from putting a DVO against him.

The doctors would not believe any of my trauma, at this point I had two psychiatrists diagnose me with PTSD. The government doctors insisted straight BP and my trauma and ongoing domestic violence issues were delusions(further traumatising me).

I had no choice but to succumb to the diagnosis.

Fast forward a couple of years 20 meds 12 sessions of unsuccessful ECT I am left with PTSD symptoms. The government doctors don’t want to see me and have told me that my problems are personality traits. Constant rumination, constant triggers, I live a miserable existence.

The main reason the doctors won’t look at CPTSD diagnosis is because that would admitting they made an error, exposing them to liability. (For context)

I am about to start paying for a private psychiatrist to treat me with the hope to get treatments suited to PTSD.

This feels like my last chance at clawing myself out of this miserable life.

Can anyone comment on how they have been able to have CPTSD and bipolar together and how having CPTSD changed their treatment from straight bipolar treatment.

It was a stressful day to start out with, and maybe I should've listened to that inner voice and decided not to go (trying not to cancel so much, but sometimes it's necessary). Anyway, I was playing about the same level as everyone else. But this older man was watching the game and decided to give advice to *just me* about how to improve. This has often been a trigger for me. I'm a young woman but not incapable, and it's true that some people have underestimated me in career and other things. In any case, I was already feeling on edge and found myself getting *angry*. I usually use this anger as a sign to assert boundaries and either leave a situation or find a way to stand up for myself (within reason), such as saying what I truly think or feel as long as I can do it gracefully and believe in myself. 

Today was different. I responded back to him and was more forceful than normal. I also found myself angrily grabbing the ball and generally showing anger/disgust when in his presence. It's like a switch went off and I just couldn't help myself. He might not have even meant anything by it, but I was being quite defensive and feel embarrassed for not regulating better.

I've had no emotional connection with myself or anyone really, I've had a very difficult time with mental health and honestly thought I was living in a movie as a character just ""doing the motions,"" is the best way I can explain it.

Over the years of being a father of my son the past 11 years, my mental health just deteriorated to the point of not even being able to do the simplest of tasks for myself or my child.  This would lead to extreme hatred towards myself for being a shitty father. I would get told from my own father how I should give my son up for adoption to him because I wasn't a good dad (it wouldn't of been possible even if I wanted to give him up)  I honestly just have felt so little hope from the negitive self-talk and talk from others that have said for so many years that I attempted suicide nearly 4 years ago. I just didn't want to feel anymore because I felt so dead inside.

In those four years, I've tried to work so hard to regain who I am and try almost all that I could afford and physically do.  CMT, EMDR, meditation, breathing technique and a ton more. I have come a long way, but still just don't feel like I have done enough and I know this is the perfectionist in me because of never being ""good enough"" by my parents when I was younger growing up. 

Well, when I attempted suicide nearly four years ago, I ended up losing custody of my son and have lost all contact with him. This boy was my life and the only reason why I tried to be a good person, so to not have any contact with him through this entire time has devistated me immensely.

I always tried to be a good father to him and this has drastically effected my mental health and worthiness of even living.  I consider myself an extreme failure as a father and person and just ask for help on what to do and how to go about trying to somehow rebuild a relationship with my nearly 11 year old son? 
I'm not sure how to even proceed to say how sorry of a dad he has to him or if staying out of his life is better?

I read stories on here of how a parent messed up somehow with their child for one reason or another and it has effected them somehow and I just think how badly I have screwed up for him and if I should bother or not.

1368,freethenipple23,1613267582,"TW: suicidal ideation and mentions of child abuse

When I was a kid, stuck in my awful home environment, there were only two adults that ever tried to help me.

One was my 3rd grade teacher. She noticed how sad I was at school and arranged for me to see the social worker. She thought I was depressed.

The other was my great-step-aunt. She called social services after my cousin and uncle, both of whom were only slightly older than myself, told her that I was being hit at home.

Unfortunately, I had been told years earlier that social workers only want to take me away from my family (my cats) so whenever I would interact with them, I would lie because I was afraid of telling the truth.

For the last year and a half, I've really doubled down on processing my childhood. 

About a year ago, I reached out to my great-step-aunt, who had been alienated from my family after reporting the abuse, and told her that she had been right. That my cousin and my uncle had been telling the truth.

This morning, I sent an email to my third grade teacher. I thanked her for trusting her instincts and trying to get me help. I told her that I was suicidal when I was in her class, and being abused at home.

What I didn't tell her is that I attempted suicide two or three times that year, and the only thing that stopped me was the thought of my cats being left with my abuser and without me. That her classroom was my refuge and that she made me feel loved. 

I just received her response and burst into years after reading it. She remembered me and she remembered how sad I always seemed. 

It's simultaneously validating and infuriating. Validating because I _was_, despite what my family claims, showing outward signs that something was wrong; Infuriating because other adults surely noticed, and chose not to help me.

I also feel anger towards the health care professionals I've gone to for help in the last few years. I am starting to come to terms with the fact that my 8 year old PTSD diagnosis affects my life every single day and my health problems are, Occam's razor here, more than likely the result of the traumas I experienced from age 4 to 17. 

The drug addiction and abusive relationships I struggled with from 13 to 17 were probably not bipolar disorder, but me exposing myself to further traumas while I struggle bussed my way through denial about everything that had happened to me when I was little.

I don't know if I'll ever feel normal, because I never learned what normal was to begin with. All I can say is that I sure hope that my bad days get less frequent, and that interpersonal relationship problems become less triggering. Maybe I can even learn about what activities I like and get some hobbies some day.

My most shaping experiences/memories are from the age of 2, and beyond that it all sort of fogs out and the horizon stops extending particularly far beyond my self; I remember: I was always alone, sometimes I saw horror movies or weird shit running on the tv, I discovered masturbation, I tried to snort my moms coke in an effort to imitate her and get her attention, I liked stealing their lighters and burning any paper I could find or poking holes into things with the needles laying around, I liked being cruel to the ants or flies that found their way into the apartment, I observed the strangers weapons around or in the apartment when my dad was there, I got taken on random midnight trips where they'd try and get a fix in some fucked up place and they'd use me as cover, I developed a hatred towards my mother and an indifference for my father (she would always start fights and he would just gtfo and well eventually he only ever even showed up on increasingly rare occasions), I liked breaking things... sometimes I threw stuff out of the window and deliberately tried to hit people so they'd complain and mom would get mad again because the only way I ever got any attention was by making her mad, and I was probably ok with that because she fundamentally disgusted me anyway and I had already begun to develop a sense of self that was detached from the actual emotional empathy of interacting with people and started to raise myself on pure cognition trying to get every possible reaction out of people so I can read them and ""play"" with them.

So now I'm no longer two years old, and I've recognised that I do actually have trauma and it isn't ""wasn't that bad it's just how it was"". I had shedded myself of a few of the disturbing and conflicting complexes that are rooted within my psyche and out from beneath all the scurries of my insecure and injured child comes another person. But this person isn't normalised, this person (by commonly espoused standards) is even worse. Whatever psychic injuries I've been subjected to, there is a lot of sadism and narcissism in me now...

Being hypervigilant doesn't feel like a choice for me, it doesn't feel like a ""learned behavior"" it feels like a 6th sense. If I walk into a room, I WILL feel everyone's emotions in that room. I can try to ignore it, but on some level I am still aware. I don't even have to be looking at people. I WILL automatically read someone, learn them, and know how they will react to the things that I do. Put it this way: If a room you're in smells terrible, you can try to ignore the smell, but you're still smelling it. 

I hear people talk about people pleasing in order to get approval/validation. Then once they figured that out they ""just stopped seeking validation"". Sure that's part of it, but I could care less about the validation. The validation isn't what I want. I've moved past that part in my recovery. I do it for safety.

I'm in perpetual stress and chronically feel like I'm unworthy and doing things wrong. I'm constantly reminded of things I was abused for as a child/teen and it rules my life to this day. I'm in my late 20s and the hell of my adolescent abuse literally feels like it just happened. 

On top of that, everyone that I've opened up to about the abuse agrees that it was, in fact, abuse and that I am traumatized. Hell, one of my long-distance friends said, ""It's obvious from the other side of the country.""

And yet...I *still* routinely doubt my CPTSD status. I continually think my abuse wasn't ""that bad,"" or that I somehow deserved what I got. That my feelings of inferiority and shame are simply a natural consequence of my being such a broken person.

For background I’m a 28yo female, grew up with single mom, only child till my dad remarried and had half siblings. Worked hard to do well in college and landed a successful career for 5 years- saved up and decided 6 months ago to quit and move to a volunteer farm to have the space to heal. 

Various symptoms: anxiety, depression, dissociation, digestive issues, auto-immune psoriasis, dermatillomania OCD, excessive masturbation as a teen, violent dreams, anxious violent ideation of potential happenings, digestive issues, hold weight in stomach in otherwise thin body, suicidal thoughts, sleep paralysis, repressed emotions, trouble making friends, trouble expressing vocally, stutter at times, anorexia, Bulimia and combination of both, fear of being hit by normal people, trouble orgasming with men.

My mother is extremely emotionally imbalanced and would certainly be diagnosed as borderline personality disorder or essentially severe C-PTSD if she would ever agree to get some help. She created a very co-dependent relationship with me and I was parentified since I was 12 as in I became her parent, her best friend, her partner, her therapist, her maid, her masseuse, her sounding board, her professional council, her “plus 1”, her on hand pep-talk, etc. There was no space for “me”, I was simply an extension of her. 
I now understand she had been physically, mentally, emotionally, and sexually abused throughout her childhood and therefore was unable to properly care for me. She told me her doctor molested her. There was a lot of tension with my moms side of the family, constant fights, and tragedy. My aunt suffered from a young age with depression, anxiety and eating disorders. Her whole life till she passed at 42 was dealing with addiction and moving from place to place. 
I never felt close to my grandparents. We would always go visit them for a couple weeks in the summer age 5-9. But I have very veryyyyy few and hazy memories of my childhood. So much is blocked out. Maybe a random memory of running outside or walking in the kitchen but no memories of interactions with people. I don’t remember what my mom was like on those trips or my grandpa at all. I see photos and can’t relate. 

Conversation with my grandpa was always superficial, light conversation. People in my family would always say “oh papa can only relate to young children... he can’t relate when they grow up.” Later on when I was a my mom would tell me to call them and I would get super anxious and procrastinate calling them to the latest part of the day. I still have a thing with phone calls. He would only talk about memories of when I was a kid “remember this? Remember that?” My voice would also always go up a couple octaves to be more child-like... I would regress in his presence. 

Age 5-9 he would periodically come to visit my moms by himself always without my grandma. The year I had a bedroom with 2 beds my mom said he would sleep in my room. I have no memories beyond him arriving. In person as an adult I never let him touch me. I actually would rarely let anyone touch me except my boyfriend. Physical touch is really hard for me. My mom would never embrace me unless SHE needed a hug. 

I never though much about my grandparents as an adult and around 24 started unpacking the trauma I experienced from my mom. That exploration thankfully lead me to coming “Out of the Fog”.   

Age 26 I had a dream after a night of smoking a lot of weed: it was in a third person perspective. The person was walking down an unlit hallway of a second floor in a home. At the end of the hallway the door stood slightly cracked open, bright light creeping out. They push the door open and find myself at around 7 years old and my grandpa both standing totally naked, grandpa awkwardly shuffles away. End of dream. 
I wake up, with racing heart, heaving breath, panic, crying, sweating. I was distraught, but couldn’t process at the same time. It was relatively non-graphic but caused terror to pulse through me.  
I couldn’t make sense of the dream so at the time I put it away. 

2 months later I’m talking with my moms oldest sister. We’re talking about my mom and I asked my aunt if she knew my mom had been molested as a child. She was shocked and said no. She then mentioned that my youngest aunt who passed away once accused my grandpa of molestation during an intervention. No one listened or believed her at the time... brushed it off. Oldest aunt said my mom and her found some “weird” journal entries about it when young aunt passed and asked mom about it. Mom said “you weren’t around, you didn’t know what it was like.” Everything came together for me in that moment. 
I felt immediately the truth that he had sexually abused me. And, I’m sure he abused my mom as well. She will never admit it, and has a history of gaslighting and intense denial linked to shame, but the hints along the way all link to the same thing. There is a history of sexual abuse in my family. I am here to end the cycle of generational abuse. 

I then decided to tell my mom. She denied ever knowing anything, “yes he slept in your room, but he would never... he was a good man, blah blah. No he never abused your aunt... she made that up.” 
I didn’t bring it up again. Of course realizing I wouldn’t get anywhere with her. She brought it up again once and told me to never talk about it because it would “ruin the family”. As in it she was fearful it would cause my grandpa to stop financially supporting her more than empathizing and supporting my experience which in itself makes everything so much more fucked up. 

I’ve broken off all contact with my mom and grandparents since then. 1 year, and the road to healing seems bright. “The Body Keeps Score” has been so helpful.

I never knew about this, like there’s a fog over years of my childhood, but I’ve always been scared of sex and was never able to actually try it with anyone despite offers.

It just made me physically sick to think about and always has. Last year (I’m 30) I finally got the courage to try, with my partner. It was the first time I tried my entire life.

The first effort ended during foreplay when I freaked out from seemingly no where to the point I wet myself.

I felt very vulnerable and scared and not at the mental state a 30 year old should be at. I asked my therapist how to fix it but she said it’s a symptom of my PTSD and that it is more about managing it than fixing it.

That is annoying to me because I want to be better and be able to have normal relationships without regressing in my mind or whatever this is. It feels maladaptive to me.

***TW: Emotional, Physical, and sexual assault and abuse, death threats, threats, and rape***

The first trauma that’s given me ptsd was when I angered this man and he got really mad at me and threatened me, saying he was gonna kill me and describing the ways he would. He grabbed my arms and shook me half to death, but thankfully another dude saw and helped me. Because of how harshly he shook me I passed out for a few seconds too. This still affects me and I feel absolutely stupid for it. It happened a few years ago, and I just feel like it “wasn’t bad enough” since it’s not like he punched me or stabbed me.

The other trauma is from when I had a friend. At first she seemed nice, she’d give me gifts and compliments a lot. The person that she was friends with, that I also befriended, was always quiet or hurt in some way. At some point she was able to tell me that she was actually abusive, and at first I wasn’t sure if I’d believe her, but then she started begging me to not talk to her anymore. So I decided to confront her about it. And she just completely changed. She went from happy and bubbly to angry and almost psychotic. I guess she thought there was no point in hiding it anymore since she started insulting and gaslighting and hitting her right in front of me. I tried to stop her but then she turned on me. That’s when she started abusing me. She’d hit me and beat me up, chocked me until I passed out or almost passed out several times, and took advantage of my ptsd from the earlier mentioned event and triggered me constantly. She said that she was the only one who’s ever care about me and that I was lucky that she didn’t kill me right there and rid the world of such a burden. But she didn’t, since she wanted my death to be slow and painful according to her. We weren’t allowed to do anything without her permission. We couldn’t talk, or eat, or use the bathroom and stuff or she’d hit us or something. She used it to humiliate us. And since we weren’t eating well, especially me, she enjoyed taking our food and eating it in front of us or not letting us eat and making us look at it. Then she’d throw it away. She’d tell us stories of her earlier victims, and we’d have to praise her or she’d hurt us. She also touched and raped me several times and purposely made it hurtful because she wanted me in as much pain as possible. Sometimes when I did something she deemed wrong, or just exist in general, she’d beat her up and make me watch. Anything I did could make it worse, like if I protested or looked away. The whole time she’d blame me, telling me that I made her do it and that I was a terrible person. Sometimes she did her “punishments” and when I’d ask her why she’d say that me existing was enough of a reason because I was such a terrible person. Because of nightmares every night from the incident with the man, I was barely sleeping, so I’d doze off during the day. She took advantage of it and anytime I did she’d trigger me or hit me and then anytime I started dozing off or just fall asleep I’d freak out cuz I connected sleep = pain even more. I tried to tell the other people in my camp, but she made them think that I was the abusive/mean one, so they never believed me and blamed me. When I tried to tell them about the raping they’d think that I was lying cuz a girl couldn’t rape another girl, and that I wanted it since I orgasmed, and if they did believe me they’d say I finally got what I deserved and praised her for it. I tried to tell the counselors but they’d bring us out together so she’d just make me lie then punish me afterwards. I’m surprised they never heard us scream, or saw us cry or the bruises. The only reason the other girl hid hers at the camp was so no one mentioned it and she got it trouble with her for it, since her parents didn’t even care whether she lived or died and she had to take care of herself and they never asked. The girl was also like 2 or 3 years older than us and stronger than us so we were never able to fight back, and she lowered our self esteems enough that most of the time we didn’t cuz we felt like we deserved it. Another thing she did was take advantage of my paranoia that he’d come back (he said that he would and nothing would stop him), saying stuff like “You’re sure he can’t find you?” Or “he might know where you live, cuz ya know the internet’s crazy now.” And stuff.

This all happened in a year, when I was 11. I've only told my partner the whole story

This only went on for like 3 months so I feel like I’m just invading with actually abuse survivors, since there’s other being with their abusers for like 3 years, or even a decade and stuff. And I feel like I deserved it since I never really fought back, or cuz I was stupid enough to believe her in the beginning when she said I was dreaming it up, or in the very beginning when I thought she was a nice person. My partner says that it wasn’t my fault and I didn’t deserve it, but I don’t feel that way, so I was hoping to get other opinions on it. I feel really pathetic and overdramatic to not be over it, since it's been a few years. Thanks for reading this whole post if you did! Sorry if I did the TW wrong, I haven't really done it before

So hi I’ve been lurking on this forum for awhile. I’m wondering if I have CPTSD, because I relate to a lot of what is said here and what I’ve found online about it. I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety along with some self harm/suicidal ideation since I was 11 which was initially triggered by a bad experience with a middle school math teacher who was very scary and humiliating to me. I got poor grades throughout middle and high school, I got very lonely and isolated, and my self esteem took a nosedive. I also had a very toxic relationship with my father, he is/was a narcissist who I often witnessed berating and criticizing my mom and since she was also had low self esteem I was often standing up to him for her and we would get in these toxic arguments, I hated him for a long time. He always had anger issues and I remember him screaming and cursing at me as a young kid. I was often very scared of him and his rage, causing me to attach more to my mom. Also gaslit me a lot when I expressed how horrible it all made me feel and told me he felt hurt because he felt I rejected him as a kid, calling me a difficult child, etc. I know this all isn’t that crazy, really not as bad as other people’s home lives at all, but maybe that’s just my inner critic, because I think it has affected me in bad ways. I am often emotionally triggered, get in really bad shame spirals, have social anxiety and just anxiety in general, and have a very strong inner bully beating me up to the point of sometimes thinking I deserve death. Its all made me feel I’ve wasted years of my life and held me back from creating a life I want, to be autonomous. I know no one can diagnose me over the internet, but is it possible I have this?

1388,cynicalunderdog,1613259798,"Ever since I can remember myself, I've always been alone.

I was raised by two mentally ill women, and the abuse began very early on. It was severe, even sadistic emotional abuse and sometimes physical. I never knew my father. I have an older sister, but she grew up in the same environment. She is very closed off emotionally, and is becoming more and more like our mother. We barely keep in touch.

As a result of my trauma, I've had trouble finding solid nurturing friendships and partners. It's always me trying to work hard for what I already deserve — basic human respect, support, honesty, love. So I attract people who assume it's OK to take advantage of me, and I just let it happen because it's something I'm used to. Being seen only as an object to meet someone else's needs, not as a person. That's how my family has always treated me, so I've become comfortable with it. Basically, abuse has been my comfort zone my entire life. So it takes effort not to get scared and run when someone shows genuine care.

I began working on my issues, stopped talking to my mother and all of my ""friends"", which has been liberating. But I realize that I will never have that unconditional love and acceptance. I'm sure I'll find better friends and a partner eventually, but it's just not the same. I mean most people probably had at least one person who could really appreciate them as a child.

1390,bobbleobble,1613259160,"Trigger warning for abuse and sexism and all that. 

I've been following the Joss Whedon stuff this week. It's just another dude in hollywood who abused his power and I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I didn't know about any of it – not what his ex wife wrote years and years ago, nothing. I've been rewatching Buffy recently, because it brings me comfort to watch older shows in isolation. When I first watched it I don't think anyone knew about any of this. While researching what exactly happened, I found out that two other actors on the show did horrible things as well. For some reason I thought it was a good idea to read about every tiny detail. I just get in this mindset of: if I'm going to spend my time with this show, I want to know. I don't want to turn a blind eye when it comes to abuse. 

But it's hard. I love Buffy so much, she's given me so much strength, I've had a still of her face as my profile picture so many times. And they've kind of ruined it. I tried watching it today, and I can't stop thinking about everything I've read. 

I've appreciated having a community on the buffy subreddit, so I have somewhere to process this(I'm there on a different username). 

But I just read a post there and... well, first it confused me, and then it just made me angry. And while I was writing a comment I realized I was simply triggered by it all. Just shaking and close to tears. The post has been upvoted quite a bit, it has two awards, people seem to agree with this guy. 

This is what everyone seems to agree on: Let's move on, let's forgive. Making art is hard, don't expect artists to be decent people. It's fine to hit on fans and ask them to come to your hotelroom. And finally, the cherry on the cake: here's a list of lessons women can learn from this &amp; Buffy. Don't trust nice men. Expect more. Everyone deserves redemption. Help abusers cope with the consequences of their actions. 

I don't know that I can post a comment there. Because all I have is anger. And I'm not sure how rational I'm being. I just know I need to feel it and let it out. How dare you give women the same old advice when it comes to men – the same shit I heard when I was 10 years old. Watch out, be careful, but also: forgive them, because they can't help it. When they hurt you, help them heal and become better. 

A man, several men, abused their power. Hurt women. Some of them have been quiet since the 90's. Have lived with trauma because they couldn't share it anywhere. 

So why on earth are women told to learn something from this? I think we're fine, dude. I'm pretty sure you're the ones with the problem. 

So why isn't their a list with things men can learn? 

I know abusers come in all shapes &amp; sizes. Trust me. My mother even used her gender to play the victim, it made me hate feminism for a long time – until I realized that isn't feminism, just abuse. I've seen it all, I know not every woman is innocent. But sexism is real. And men get away with this, for decades. Often they get to work their whole life in their dream job, while they fire women for speaking up. So no, I don't want to move on. I can't. Women are speaking up about being abused, harassed, assaulted, fired for being pregnant. 

Sexism is real, not just in hollywood – I worked somewhere and was sexually harrassed every day. I wasn't seen for what I could do, I wasn't listened to, I was just someone to hit on. Constantly. When I spoke up, I was told to shut up. My best friend blamed me. I internalized all of it. After a traumatizing childhood, I got my dream job – and was traumatized all over again.

I quit my job and I cut ties with that best friend. I will never be quiet. I will never work anywhere where I'm treated like that again. And I'm okay now. 

But I still feel so alone in all of this a lot of the time. It's like a lot of people just don't want to acknowledge the extent of sexism. No one supported me. And it hurt the most when women didn't – including my best friend. When she got angry with me and told me: I'm not a feminist because I don't hate men. And if you leave this job, you're a coward.

I keep reminding him, he says sorry and I think he means it, but hes so drunk it's like he keeps forgetting. 

I LOSE my shit. He does it again, and I grabbed his hand really firmly and said ""You will draw back a nub the next time you touch me there."" 

He audibly said ""woah fuck"" and was obviously quite scared of me- and apperently I had said it loudly because everyone was staring. 

Then come the comments ""woah what are you a psychopath?"" ""Hes really drunk he doesn't mean it"" ""you need to chill"" 

So I say I don't give a shit and leave. He practically runs away from me as I exit. 

The next day was hell because apperently I scared everyone- now I'll admit, I am one of those people who can make themselves look, really crazy. But it's a bluff. I've never hurt anyone.

I would never hurt anyone and I can usually keep myself from doing anything stupid when this happens, but it’s still terrifying and overwhelming. 

I guess that when this happens, part of my mind is so desperate that the only solution it can find for the cause of the trigger is to remove/get rid of what’s causing it, even if that happens to be a group of people. Basically it thinks “the only way that this pain will end is if the people who caused it are no longer alive”. 

I hate my brain for entering this mindset. It makes me feel like I’m a criminal and that I could just lose it at any moment and become one of those disturbed mass murderers that ends up all over the media for the wrong reasons.

1401,purpleveganglow,1613252944,"[TW for sexual assault, mention of childhood emotional neglect/physical abuse, and race-related trauma

Hi, everyone. I hope your day is going alright so far. 🙂 I am new here but this seems like a really wonderful community of people. I am wondering if someone might be able to offer their thoughts or experiences. 

I have had PTSD since I was 20 from sexual assault (am female), but further research and the suggestion of a therapist long ago leads me to believe I already had C-PTSD beforehand from childhood neglect and emotional and physical abuse.

I have been in therapy for over 10 years, to little avail. While my panic attacks and flashbacks have been reduced with time and EMDR treatment, my day-to-day is still absolutely chaotic. Issues that have gone unsolved and which negatively affect every waking moment of my life include:

-	believing male attention is a required prerequisite for self-worth. This basically destroyed my high school years, as nobody “liked” me like that. I believed I was worthless. I don’t know exactly why I came to feel this way when I was young, but it resulted in horrible self-esteem.

-	extreme fear of men. After being assaulted I became unable to go out into the world without earbuds, because the way men casually talk about women like they are currency, walking vaginas, only valuable for their appearance, etc. was triggering. Getting too close to men would make my throat close up.  With the exception of my incredible partner and a few of his friends, I have essentially cut all men out of my life because it is simply too exhausting and triggering to hear the word “bitch” (among others) used to describe women in casual conversation. 

-	intolerance of almost all media. Rape and attempted rape scenes, hitting and insulting/joking about women are in just about every show, so i have to 1) spoil every tv show for myself beforehand to make sure I’m not setting myself up for a panic attack, and 2) not watch a great many popular shows. I’m not even bothered by this one except for the fact that it is SO isolating. I can’t even connect with people over tv or music (see below).

-	same goes with music, especially hip-hop. I CANNOT listen to it because of how hateful it always is towards women. This hurts particularly because 1) I was raped in South Korea. As not many Koreans know much about black people (I am black; white people are the “preferred” foreigners) the images the US imports of black music inform many Koreans’ opinions of black women. They assumed I was as overtly sexual as Beyoncé/Rihanna/backup dancers in men’s rap videos, including the belief that I would ENJOY (yes) being called a bitch, because that’s what the music implies.

-	rage attacks (fairly new. I NEVER used to get angry) and extremely poor emotional regulation. I end up crying nearly every day because I hate myself so much and find myself so disappointing.

-	inability to keep a job. Some workplaces have been so constantly triggering that I have been unable to even stay awake once coming home. 

-	brain fog and attention issues. My partner jokes that when we discuss what we just  watched on TV together it’s more like “watching comprehension,” because I can often barely grasp what occurs. My attention span can’t handle it. I’m always forgetting why I walked into rooms and am terrible at following instructions and keeping track of things. 

-	bad social skills. Moreover, distaste for even developing them because I feel like 95% of the time, I don’t benefit from putting myself in front of people anyway. I know this is detrimental but I can’t even make myself care. It keeps me safer than talking to strange men ever has.

-	I also think I am alienating my support network, because none of them have been assaulted, and 2/3 of them are not women. I feel as though if I need help, I need to also come prepared with clear explanations of exactly what I need, which is not really possible in the midst of a panic attack, nor does it work particularly well at the best of times, IME. At this point I feel like asking friends and family for help just makes things messier because I always end up having to explain myself. 

I HAVE to change something, but I have come to realize it’s not going to happen by committing an hour once a week to getting better or through others’ support. I have gone to therapy, searched for support groups (none I could afford), read trauma literature, done EMDR on my own time, started meditating, talked to my own friends. Per the post title, I have concluded that my only solution is to develop a daily treatment plan by myself and for myself, because no one I have spoken with has been able to really guide me to a healthy state of mind. I also believe the racial dimension of my situation is a barrier to receiving truly effective treatment, as my circumstances were pretty uncommon.

I am asking if anyone, after having read all this (if you have, THANK YOU), can suggest a starting point, link an outline or resource, or maybe share personal experiences for healing any or all of the above things. I feel like I have so many problems knocking me down all day that my progress is almost always trashed by the end of the day. I also wonder if there is a “keystone” issue of PTSD that might shake something loose, so to speak, if it were addressed first. I desperately need to make facing the day easier so that improvement is the focus, not just emotionally scraping by.

TL;DR: Sexual assault (adulthood) and child abuse destroyed my self esteem. I cannot engage with most people or media out of fear. Awful social skills, brain fog, and poor emotional regulation keep getting in the way of progress. Therapy only marginally helpful. I’ve accepted the bulk of change will have to come from self-treatment. Is there any work I can do on a daily basis to actually get results?

1403,EarthcrusherTheHero,1613252318,"As mentioned in the title, I'm involved with a girl who has multiple partners; her wife and another girlfriend, both of whom are my closest friends and people I consider family. The poly lifestyle isn't for everyone, but it has been a privilege getting to know my girlfriend and these wonderful people who share my love for her.

Notably, I'm the only man in the relationship. I'm her first real boyfriend, and it came with a lot of ups and downs - but to make a long story short, we've really made this thing work.

This all changed recently. New Partner (we'll use NP) is non-binary, and I have no intention of disrespecting their identity, but to make sense of this, I'll say that if you saw them on the street and didn't know them, you'd probably call them a man. NP is actually a very sweet person, and though I don't know them nearly as well as the other partners (it's a little tricky to find common ground), when the shit hit the fan in their life, we offered them a place to stay for a little while, and I was completely cool with that.

Why clarify their gender identity at all? Well, my girlfriend had been dating NP on a long-distance basis for about two years, maybe a little longer. Until now, they had only met in person twice. Needless to say, once they settled in, she was eager to make up, physically, for lost time. I don't think there's anything wrong with that - I've had past similar relationships, varying from simple open ones to straight-up polyamory, and god knows that one of the main components is bringing someone new *into the fold*, as it were, and getting out all your energies on them until the feeling of newness wears off.

The issue is I can hear everything through the walls. It's not even like they're being loud, I can just hear it. And the funny thing is that I thought I'd be fine with it, but in that moment, all I could think about was my first major relationship, which had ended with a cold and unusually distant breakup. I was basically forced to continue living with my ex and their own New Partner for months, during which time they basically emotionally abused and degraded me, and - on top of everything - fucked constantly, like a pair of especially loud rabbits, on the couch right up next to the bedroom wall, nearly every night, while I was trying to sleep.

I thought I was a lot stronger than this. I've done so much growing since that first relationship. The bond I have with my girlfriend is nothing like it. A relationship like ours only works with trust, security, and self-assuredness, and I had it in spades. I can't make it clear enough that this girl is my *rock*, and I never worry that I'm the wrong person for her. But every time she and NP fuck, all I can think of is how I had to listen to my ex, gasping and moaning right before they were out of my life for good.

It fuckin' kills me. Intellectually, I know that I'll probably get used to this, and once NP and I get to know each other better maybe I won't even care at all. But for now, all I have is this horrible feeling in my gut, like once again, I'm being left for (NP, please forgive the misgendering) some other man, and I'll have months to sit and listen to them bang while I'm trying to sleep. It's stupid; the situation is completely different, but I'm realizing that trauma doesn't always make sense.

No idea what to do. Thanks for reading.",CPTSD,"I'm in a polyamorous relationship. None of my girlfriend's partners have bothered me, until the new one came to stay with us.

So it’s been a tough couple weeks, but I’m making really good progress and I’m optimistic I’ll keep making progress (though I’m prepared for the probability of set backs).

But this whole “senate acquitting Donald trump” again really has me reeling. I’m American (if that wasn’t clear) and a woman and I have a lot of issues with the patriarchy. I’ve had a lot of experience being held to different standards than men in my life and I just recently discovered some insights that helped me come to terms with that. But this impeachment trial is very triggering.

Imagine if he was a woman. I mean, Donaldina Trump would never be elected because a woman would never be able to be fat and be elected President. And even if she could distract people from her weight she’d never have been elected after bragging about grabbing 18 year old “men” by the dick and “they just let her because she’s famous”.

But let’s pretend donaldina trump got elected. Imagine if a woman had stood on that stage and yelled about “fighting back at the capitol”. After the whole Benghazi shit show I just can’t imagine they’d have acquit her.

And it makes me sad. And angry. And it’s hard to process these emotions for me. And there’s nothing I can do, which makes me feel powerless which is also triggering.

This results in my appearing calm to others when I'm really fucking dying inside with anxiety or on the flip side feeling completely numb.

This recently came up for me again because I was exploring sexual trauma in EMDR therapy. After a few sessions my therapist said they felt like I was really strong because I hadn't had an intense emotional reaction, crying,  etc when discussing the trauma and they said it was common for people to emotionally break down when asked to relive the trauma in therapy.

_____________

Right now I am just angry and tired. This week I took a vacation from my shitty and simple job to have more time to apply for better jobs, work on my side projects and art. ANd to my own surprise I ran into problem that has been there with me my whole life- procrastination. Or more like a constant need to seek distractions.

And on monday I go back to my shit old job with almost nothing done (yeah, I did some things, but on average I only spent 1 hour per day on things that I really wanted to focus on). And I have worked on myself. Fucking last 2 years were full of intense work on all kinds of issues that I have. And I know that I have made progress, but it seems like not in this problem.

And it's not that I am realizing this just now, at the end of this week. Couple of days ago I got high out of my mind on weed and had an epiphany that I am living on autopilot. So the next day I tried to change it- to be more present, to be aware of my actions. 

And here I was next morning- mindfully sitting at a table before my breakfast. And it was like there was a huge bleeding wound in my soul. And it was unbearable. I don't even understand why or where this emotional pain is coming from. But this shit is here, with me. And I can face it. But facing it changes nothing. The loger I face it the worse it gets.

So I seek distractions. I procrastinate. I try to be perfect. I try to escape it. And it helps. But only in the short term. The best distractions quickly turn into addictions. And then couple of months later I wake up and find myself in even worse place. And then I try to get sober. I try to be present, to face my demons. And for a while I might enjoy this ""pink cloud"", but it seems like my demons always have more stamina and endurance than me. And then this cycle starts again.

I am so fucking tired of this shit.

I am honestly losing hope. 

Have I asked why am I like this? Yes, for longer than I remember. And every time I can't find an answer. I have digged through my memories way too much. And I still feel empty handed.

Born into a country 3 years after it regained independence from soviets I grew up poor as fuck. Because everyone was poor. Having money to buy doughnuts in school was rare. I was eating in school for meal coupons. Now that I think about it, out of 500+ kids in that school I was among maybve 5 others who were eating that way.

And at schools we were also animals. We were fucking cruel. Even though bullying (almost) never got physical, we were fucking animals. And most of the time I was not the target. But that doesn't make it even better. I was always on defence.

Always on the defence. I remember the boys from our class were fighters. We would often fight with kyokushin rules (ho strikes to head) and we were not pulling punches. And sucker punches to stomach were also common. And even now, 10 years after that I always keep my abs tense. Holy shit.

Now some years ago I learned abuut CPTSD and it clicked with me. I can't recall trauma, but I have 90% of the listed symptoms, so I guess there was something. And CPTSD community loves to hate parents, but I don't feel so sure here.

Yeah, my parents were devoted funamentalist christians (thanks american missionaries), and I have already confronted them about some things that I think were fucked up in their upbringing of me and my siblings. But I can't hate them. They always took care of me and my brothers, always cared, always tried their best. And for the things I have confronted them about, they are sorry and they have changed their behaviour. 

But something is not right. And I can't understand what, why or how to change it. Something about our relationships and communication dynamics in our family is not right. And even though I was part of it I have no idea why.

Why I can't look into the eyes of some of my brothers. Why me and my brothers don't talk. Why have I built a wall between myself and all family members. Why do I now see my youner brothers do the same. Why don't I trust my mother and my father? Why for the most of my life I wished to be a psychopath because they don't feel emotions or some shit? Why was I actively supressing my emotions, as a way to be strong.

Why is everything the way it is?

Why does it look like  like my father faces the same challenges as me? Will I fucking end up like him? Or will I find a way out?

And that's the fcuking scariest thing for me. If I lose this war against myself. If I will never find a way out, a way to fee myself from all this bullshit. If I am doomed to fail all my tries to find freedom, then I would rather just die now. And I know that there is a real chance of losing. Honestly I see more people who have failed than who have succeeded. And I am terrified.

I would rather kill myself now than watch myself for the rest of my life running in circles from one distraction to another.

And why did I have to be the oldest brother out of 6 of us? Now I see my little boys going the same path as me. Shutting everyone out, answering ""I don't know"" to every question. They know. They just don't trust you to talk about it. They don't want to show weakness. And I know because I am the same.

But they are young. They probably don't yet know that something is wrong. But I know that things are wrong. The problem is that I have no clue what to do about it. I have no clue how to fix it. How to make things right.

And I feel like I have no one to ask. My 1 year younger brother seems to be doing alright in his life. But even though he gets me better than others (because he grew up in same family, church, shcool and neighbourhood), he was always very different from me. For me seems like he was always doing better than me.

And I'm not gonna ask my father, because I don't see him as someone who can teach me anything valuable. And so since I am the oldest one it's up to me to find a solution. For myself and my brothers.

Honestly, fuck this all shit. I am so tired. And I am so angry.

It probably takes more effort to yell at me about how I was ruining my body, going to get an infection and go to the hospital and that my clothes were bloody then to Google search it.

Maybe all these results popped up within the five years since I stopped. But, also, I found stuff online at 17. That's how I found out about it and stopped it. I suffered through it and recovered from it completely and utterly alone. I told my mom that I thought I had dermatillomania at dinner, and she didn't even look up from her menu.

There are so many things that a quick Google search or basic empathy would have alleviated. My childhood could have been so much better if they just went ""why is my child sensitive to sound?"" instead of hating me for being that way. Or maybe consider the red flag that I couldn't walk on the sidewalk without alternating my feet, and would panic if I didn't. Don't expect me, a literal 5 year old, to know why I was binge eating.

With that said, I've had one part time job for almost 2 years now so I don't think that I job hop like I used to due to stress or boredom or whatever. however if it's a case where the environment is flat-out abusive then I leave without question and sometimes without a job lined up.

I had a bad day yesterday which resulted in my having an emotional breakdown where I expressed to my partner that I felt hurt/sad by his lack of initiating sex, and the general lack of touch in our day-to-day.  My revelations shocked me because while these things had crossed my mind before, I truly did not feel these were issues to me on a daily basis.  I'm a bit worried that my mind is making it up and the feeling that these are important to me will disappear when I feel better.

As soon as the words left my mouth I felt angry  and sick and anxious and immediately started having feelings of dread and regret and almost whispers of, ""Now you've done it.""  I felt like a part of my mind was attacking itself.  Feelings of, ""You shouldn't have rocked the boat"" and ""Well you have wreaked it now.""  

My partner was shocked and saddened by my revelations and pledged all manner of changes.  I feel terrible that I may have hurt him and wanted to take it all back but in the moment I also was just so angry because a part of me was pissed at having to express these needs and sad for having to ask for attention that my mind feels should be given organically if your partner loves you.

I was immediately transported to a childhood memory of where I expressed a want to my mom, and it resulted in her giving me the silent treatment for days.  I was seven or eight and I had asked her to drop me off a block from school because she was driving my dads little junky work truck.  I remember feeling embarrassed of the truck and having a hard time at school being bullied in my friend group, so I can only assume I was trying to find ways to not draw negative attention there.  I remembered the sick and churning and panicked feeling of, ""Why won't she speak to me?  I want my mom.""  I now feel like my mind has been doing things behind the scenes to avoid this feeling my whole life. 

Now I am freaking out and looking back over my relationships and wondering if I have been always been suppressing things I need so I don't have to bring them up and risk what my mind thinks will be a catastrophe?  I have been having small rumbles of ""awareness"" here and there.  Mostly it's been the realization that I was a ""sensitive"" child who was raised by very young, selfish, and emotionally neglectful parents.  I have started to realize that my identity is lacking and that past a certain level, I don't really know what I like, need etc. 

Even now, the next morning, I am confused if the needs I expressed to my partner are really needs.  He is the most wonderful person in the world and it feels weird to even have any complaints.  He asked why I hadn't ever said anything before and I truly didn't have an answer because my previous awareness of the issues were just flashes of consciousness.  I had no idea these were issues of importance to me.  I feel awful and fearful of opening my mouth.

I realized that in previous relationships I would leave before working on anything.  At 45 yo I realized that I don't have experience in knowing my needs, expressing needs, and working through stuff. Thank god he does.  He said that a relationship is always growing that it needs constant attention.  Still now I am wracked with guilt and fear that I have caused him terrible emotional pain and that there will be a reckoning of some kind.  I think of myself as a very strong person despite my mental health issues and now I really feel like a whiner.  I'm sorry if this is a ramble, it's just such a tangle of emotions.

Did anyone else do this? Some of it was taught due to having to leave the house on short notice occasionally, but I actually started doing it and planning it on my own.

1432,gratefuldaughter2,1613237564,"I’ve been reading “Untamed” by Glennon Doyle and have been meditating on so many of the beautiful passages and messages from her book. The book itself is not necessarily about trauma, but about the plights of being a woman with x convictions in world that operates in y way. I highly highly recommend this read. It’s validating and empowering and phenomenal through and through. Truly, I can only read one mini chapter at a time and leave several days of space between them because they just leave you with so much to sit on. 

Here, I just want to point to a phrase she’s coined that has perfectly expressed my deepest desires: “may we all live in communities where every person’s truest Self is both held and free.” 

This cut like a knife. In part because “held” and “free” seem to be... conflicting ideas? But they’re not. The opposite of held is isolated. And the opposite of free is caged. 

Caged and isolated is what all the gaslighting, scapegoating, and emotional neglect did to me. And it caused disorganized attachment. I think what glennon is describing here is the exact opposite of the push/pull dynamic I experience. It’s the freedom and the safety. It’s true belonging. 

I hope this message reaches someone who needs it. It’s truly the wish that I have for all of you: May you be held and free. 

And, if any of you were inspired by the book, or are now inspired to begin reading, feel free to DM. I’d love to bask in these beautiful messages with you.",CPTSD,May you be held and free,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lj4yfu/may_you_be_held_and_free/,1613208764.0

As a result, I was often extremely cold in the winter, and we did whatever we could to keep warm: heating up water bottles, cuddling, piling under blankets, but it was never enough to truly keep you warm. Today, my heat stopped working for the first time in my adult life (22F) and the landlord said it might take a while for them to come fix it because of how many other tenants’ heaters have stopped working too. And I know it’s unreasonable, but I feel an extreme sense of panic thinking about going even a few hours cold in this type of weather.

Dumb animals don't overthink anything or doubt their worth.  They just want to survive and get their needs met.  If they're hungry, they search for food.  If they're thirsty, they search for water.  If they're lonely, they find others of their own kind.  Sometimes you meet your own dumb animal brain in a dire situation when survival just takes over.  Trust it.  Looking back at my life, there were times I just let dumb animal brain guide me, and actually it did a really good job of looking out for me.

1439,OpasnostLapshoi,1613233768,"Hey people,

I'm wondering if other people experience this or know what it is? Also if anyone else can relate to the scenarios at all? 

I was having a strange couple of days recently where the weather changed and I was going on walks to explore different neighborhoods in my city. I live in a different city far away from where I grew up, so typically the two places don't look alike enough to remind me of the other. Sometimes I would walk down an unfamiliar street with indistinctive or average architecture and I get this thought like ""Oh this feels like/looks like \[old city\]. It would bring up memories or some sort of feeling of almost like a mini flashback. It doesn't quite feel like the full overwhelming ""I've transported back in time it's happening again/imminent"" feelings of a typical trauma flashback for me, but just like a reflection on the general feelings and memories of those times. Almost like I'm back in the mindset, body, and context of myself at that time, but without the feelings of imminent threat or danger. I'm not really sure if this fits the portrait of an emotional flashback? A regular one? Is it just daydreaming? I'm not quite sure I've put this into words very well, but I also noticed myself doing certain behaviours I did at the times of these memories, even though they don't serve my situation anymore: like carrying lots of things with me and constantly checking my backpack, trying to avert notice, avoid police, hide out in corners/alleys, go into public spaces for warmth and shelter, and had this intense drive to stay outside/out in public and not go home, even though I have a safe and comfortable place to go home now. This lasted for 2 days, I'm still a little bit stuck in this but I got overwhelming triggered into a ""normal"" flashback yesterday so that's been what's most prominent on my mind at the moment.

TW: Suicide, Self harm, Abuse &amp; drug/alcohol misuse

So I've had alot of trauma in my life, and It's starting to effect me again

My mom was really abusive during my childhood, (physically and verbally), and I never really knew my dad, because my mom said ""he is a bad person, you dont want to see him"" even though he isnt.. as bad as she makes him seem. 

Anyways, when I was 12 years old, I saw my brother dead after he commit suicide. After that I developed alot of mental illness (PTSD, depression) 

My other brother, is starting to get abusive too, like my mom. 

I also recently got into a breakup—so thats just hard to deal with too.

Anyways I've been getting more and more flashbacks of what happened when i was 12, and im constantly waking up through the night crying.

I've started to turn to drugs and alcohol to numb myself, as well as some self harm. I'm not too sure what to do anymore. Sort of wishing I could just not be here anymore",CPTSD,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/lj3n8q/ptsd/,1613204785.0

1443,illdiesoonanyway,1613232393,"I'm only 21 but the amount of trauma I've faced is atronomical. It honestly blows my mind just how much I have gone through, in terms of variety of traumatic situations I've been in since I was born. 

Firstly, disorganized attachment and subsequent trauma from witnessing domestic violence as a young child, emotional neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse. An alcoholic father and emotionally reactive mother. I developed secondary dissociation as a way to cope. I went through instances of CSA later in childhood, while still being emotionally and verbally abused by my parents.

Then, I was left to live with my main abuser for the entirety of my teenhood, while the country I lived also deteriorated rapidly and there was a quick decline of basic necessities: water and power shortages, food scarcity, and incremental deliquency that made it unsafe to even leave the house with a smartphone lest armed robbers shot you down or kidnapped you. Once I got chased by two armed robbers walking home from school. Several similar instances of loved ones being victims of violence. I even had one cousin kidnapped at a point. 

All the while living with an alcoholic abuser that made it his mission to mentally torture me every day of my life while repeatedly putting my life at risk, threatening to end my life, and making me have several mental breakdowns throughout the years. I spent an entire year in a dissociated catatonic state, not getting up from bed almost at all, from all the stress. Every day you'd hear of a new murder, serial killers would roam around freely and nothing would be done to catch them. I lost a bunch of weight. I was so dissociated that I flunked middle school and high school and barely graduated. 

When I was able to leave the country at eitghteen, I found myself even at a worse state abroad. Tried going to college several times but had a severe mental breakdown at each attempt. Only recently I have been able to reel myself in and to feel a bit more stable. I had to do a lot of things to survive that brought me even more trauma and I'm lucky I didn't get trafficked as I'm at such a vulnerable position with my history and current situation.

 I still have no support, of course. I don't even have a hope for a prosper future knowing how little prospect I have in life. As an immigrant I have to prove I am worthy of living here (as to not get deported) that I deserve to live. Most of the time I struggle to even look myself in the mirror. Many times I have tried ending my own life. Many times my parts have stopped me, or just pure chance made it impossible.
