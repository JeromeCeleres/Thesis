**Reposting with some updates** 

POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNINGS/TW

My life wouldn‚Äôt be called easy by some people. But I am at a place in my recovery where I feel stronger than ever. It has taken years for me to get there and a lot of pain but it‚Äôs my story and it is why I am who I am.

I (20 F) have been abused by different people from a very young age. I grew up with my dad laying on top of me when I woke up which started when I was 4 and continued until I was close to 16 even if I slept not wearing clothes he would continues to do this things. He would call me mommy and ask me to come wipe him when he was in the bathroom. He would complain that his ‚Äúbottom hurt‚Äù after he pooped. I never did anything when he said those things but I stayed away from him. 

When I was in seventh grade I became depressed and started self harming. 

When I was in eighth grade I was bullied verbally and physically by a group of people I though were my friends. They would threaten to hurt themselves if I didn‚Äôt do what they asked (send them nudes, kiss them, date them). I still have scars from them. This continued with me and 3 other girls until Freshman year of high school. 

Eight grade was also the first time I was raped by my at the time boyfriend. He guilted me in to sleeping with him and even after I said no continued until it was already happening. It was not the only time things happened. 

Sophomore year I was dating a female and she surprised me by bringing a guy over (who didn‚Äôt know her and I were together) and told him we were going to have a three way. Not exactly the best way to surprise your girlfriend who you have never talking to about this. 

Junior year I was raped again by a different guy who I was friends with. He pinned me down and beat me until I didn‚Äôt fight back anymore. I still have scars from him. This again happened more than once. 

Senior year of high school I was manipulated in to dating a guy because he wanted to be exclusive. It went pretty good for a while until he ended up not trusting me. He went through my phone constantly and wouldn‚Äôt allow me to talk to my best friend. He would go out to dinner with a group of girls and come back drunk and I shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it but I was barely able to see anyone of my friends. Any time I went out he would pick a huge fight. After he and I broke up he started stalking my house and threatening suicide unless I got back with him. I ended up having to call the police because of everything he was doing.

My mom is a mastermind behind guilt tripping. She has perfected it as if it were an art. She has pushed me in to doing things for her. Not being upset with her because she was already upset. And she swears up and down she has no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. She made me feel guilty about eating because I was making to much noise in the kitchen. I stopped eating for two weeks and no one noticed. 

My parents got divorced when I was 6. This left me with extreme amounts of anxiety. I had my first panic attack when I was in 4th grade. And I continue to struggle with my anxiety today. My parents never sent me for help when I was hurting myself even after I begged. 

My mom remarried. To a guy who doesn‚Äôt know how to share or how to be a family and who has insane anger issues. He goes from being happy and smiley to throwing things around the house and screaming with no warning. 

Growing up my life was not easy. But I wouldn‚Äôt be who I am today if I didn‚Äôt go through those things. And my life wasn‚Äôt all bad, there are some incredible people who mean the world to me. Those people are the ones who remind me that even when it gets tough it does get better. I was not planning on making it past 16. And here I am at 20. 3 years without self harming. Recovering from my eating disorder. I am going to therapy. I have cut the toxic people from my life. It does get better. I‚Äôm glad I survived. I‚Äôm proud of who I am and the things I went though because now I know I can handle so much more in life. Don‚Äôt be ashamed of your past, your story. It makes you who you are. It may not be pretty but it does get better I promise üíïüíï

4,DotNegative5853,1614182395,"Hi! This is my first time asking a question on reddit and I'm a little nervous so bear with me here. 

trigger warning: mentions of white supremacy and religious abuse including transphobia

I grew up in an extremely abusive home as a child. I don't want my parents to find this post so I can't go into too much specific detail but let's just say I was homeschooled most of my childhood (and not taught anything but whitewashed history and the basics of math and english). I had no friends and the ones I did have I was forced to pretend my life was just like theirs. I had no privacy. My journals were read, my mother constantly forced my father to choose between me and her, and the religious trauma was through the roof (major purity culture, the church didn't help when something was clearly wrong, I was shamed for being me at every opportunity). 

Without going into too many details that could possibly give me away, let's just say my parents left me with CPTSD and other mental illness issues and I have been working on desperately trying to heal since I ran away from home in 2008. 

As a result of the abuse I wrongly decided to get married far too young. I didn't see the signs of abuse in my relationship before I got married because I hadn't really even come to terms with the abuse my parents put me through, therefore I was clueless as to how to heal. 

A few years ago I finally decided I had had enough and I left him. Things had gotten physical and were escalating. I couldn't afford my own place and didn't have any friends who were then looking for a new apartment that I trusted to live with me and my child. I was forced to move back in with my parents until I was able to get back on my feet. 

I lasted about a year. I told them before I moved back in with them that I was out as transgender and that I was also queer. Just to get that out of the way. They convinced me this wasn't a problem but I was foolish for believing them. 

I lasted there about a year. I was really struggling with my mental health at the time. It was remnants of a decline that started immediately after giving birth a few years prior. My depression was the worst part. I had just gotten diagnosed with bipolar disorder not that long before moving in with them and I was adjusting to new medicine while simultaneously being told by one parent that I was only taking medicine as a cop-out. I was not taken seriously, even when I was lying on the couch shaking uncontrollably with anxiety. I really needed help and, once again, was not afforded that option. I was belittled at every opportunity. My parenting was always under question. I was called names and told that I am basically a horrible person for being transgender or even attempting to live life as someone far too old to be talked to like that. I was told they were ashamed of me because I wore a bow tie to a family function. Things were escalating. I was even barged in on once in my room, which they had refused the entire year that I was there to put on a door knob under the idea that they couldn't find the right one to fit their aesthetic. I didn't have one for most of my childhood either. 

Right before I moved out for the final time and disowned them, I came out to them once again and told them that I would be starting hormones and since I knew they wouldn't approve I would be moving in with my partner. My father immediately offered me money in exchange for me to sign over rights for my child so long as I disappeared far away with my partner. Of course I said no and I moved out a few weeks later. 

They didn't like how I left. I had warned them I would be moving out slowly but since things had escalated quickly at home in ways I won't type here they decided to lock me and my child out of their house while they went on a vacation leaving us completely unable to access any of our belongings for a week. My child has asthma. Calling the cops did nothing as they were gone in an unreachable place. 

When they returned to officially move out the rest of my belongings I was faced with more abuse in front of my partner. I have chosen not to speak to them since as they still cannot apologize, call me by my right name or pronouns, or respect me in any manner. 

I am in the middle of a divorce from the person I married far too young. We had mediation LAST WEEK where I stated I didn't want my child having any contact with my parents. My ex knows this, but his family has allowed the contact anyway all of last year. During our session I was lied to and told that my parents don't even like them and they would be sure to communicate to their parents my request. 

Two days later I received an email. My parents hired a lawyer in NOVEMBER to file for grandparent visitation rights. Their court date with me is also my next court date. It was purposeful, in my opinion, the way things were handled to swoop in and throw this court issue my way. I cannot afford a lawyer. I am representing myself and desperately trying to sort out how to handle all of this legal matter online with zoom calls. I have plenty of evidence in journals and old Facebook posts discussing the abuse I endured but I have no idea how to even handle any of this or how to use it in this court case. 

I am utterly terrified of my parents having even the tiniest amount of contact with my child. They are horrible, abusive, terrifying, manipulative people who haven't hesitated for one second to fight in front of my child. In fact, without my prompting, she felt the need to constantly defend me to them because she figured out I am trans before I even told her. 

I have court tomorrow and I am terrified. I was given no time to prepare a case for this and seeing as I am very mentally ill and am seriously struggling to keep it together through all of this, I have no idea what I am doing. I want to ask for a continuance but have no idea how. Everyone keeps telling me I need a lawyer but there are no resources or anyone that is able to pro bono help me. I don't have lawyer friends. I am doing this all on my own thanks to google. I can't let my parents see my child. I know exactly the type of shaming, abusive things they would say to her and how awful they would talk about me behind my back. My brother is a known white supremacist. Honestly so are my parents. They are horrible, horrible people and the public thinks they are amazing because they put on that Paula Dean front.  

I need any advice someone can offer me. I am terrified of having to deal with them even if there is a constant third party when she sees them. There isn't anyone I know who will fight or advocate for me in their presence if they manage to get visitation rights. It feels like all of my abusers are sitting together at a table, talking about me, and plotting on how to ruin my life. I have load of other personal things unrelated that I am going through right now and I am terrified that I am somehow going to accidentally screw this up. I need to feel safe and I haven't most of my life. I want to make sure my child isn't being exposed to the same things I was.

5,Zman11588,1614180984,"I‚Äôve recently gone through some things in my marriage and the discussion of separating has come up. I was having a rough time dealing with it and I reached out to my dad. When I was younger my parents had separated for a bit but got back together and seemed to have a good relationship. I asked him the reason for the separation. I had always heard rumblings or thought he had had an affair. He got real quiet and said ‚ÄúI did something much worse‚Äù my mind started racing and I said ‚Äúok...‚Äù he then proceeded to tell me that he had molested my older sister and brother. 

Needless to say I was completely shocked. I was silent for a moment and told him that I had to go. I immediately called my brother and told him what had happened. He got quiet and told me a bit more. He had attempted to fondle my brother when he was sleeping but was caught in the act. He told me that what had happened with my sister was much worse. I found out that it had started when she was 11 and went on for years.

A little backstory. He is technically all of ours stepdad. My mom had been married, had my brother and sister, divorced, met my birth dad, had me, my birth dad left and then my mom met and married who i call my dad because I don‚Äôt remember a time when he wasn‚Äôt in my life. He was a navy friend of her first husband. Kind of a weird dynamic.

When I spoke with my sister she explained that my mom and her dad both knew. They did go to court with it but nothing really came of it except she got a lock on her door. The thought of my poor sister basically being fed to this asshole by all the people and systems in her life that should have been protecting her destroys me.

All this was kept from me so I could have a normal childhood. He was a good provider for the family and up until a couple weeks ago, I looked back at my childhood as a wonderful time. We maintained this facade for YEARS. We would always go holidays and family gatherings and stuff and again, the thought of my siblings just having to bury this makes me sick.

It gets even worse. My sister went on to marry a great guy and have 2 awesome kids. My mom would constantly guilt her about not getting to spend as much time with the grandkids as her husbands parents. They did see them plenty though. Apparently a few years ago, they had gotten into the argument again and my mom had said to my sister that ‚Äúshe had seduced her husband‚Äù I was floored with how utterly evil these people I had nothing but good memories of were. My mom passed away almost a year ago and I had been missing her a lot lately but as soon as I found all this out, I just wish she was back so I could fucking scream at her.

Right not my biggest concern is my siblings who have had to keep this secret all this time and are now having to confront it again. I am so thankful that they had my interests in mind but I also feel so guilty that they had to do that for me. We have talked a lot and become so much closer which I would not have thought possible because we were already very tight.

I am having so many thoughts right now and can‚Äôt seem to make sense of any of my feelings. Especially about what, if anything to say to my dad. All year he has been really depressed because of losing his wife and all else that has been going on. I find myself briefly feeling sorry for the guy. To me he has never been anything but a good father for 36 years. He was my hero. To find out the true nature of everything, I know I need to disown him but also, my siblings had come to terms with it and seemed to have formed some type of relationship with him, is it my place?

I realize this is all over the place. I think I just needed to get it all out there.

I'm having a very difficult time wrapping my head around the death of my abuser. I haven't seen or spoken to him in probably 7 years or more. I'm happily married to a wonderful man with whom I have two beautiful children now.

But I just learned of his death a couple weeks ago.

Backstory: I was 16 going on 17 when we met. He was 21. We worked together and quickly formed a bond. We were together for about a year and a half and ""engaged"" for a short time. He proposed on my 18th birthday. I felt obligated to accept.

He was emotionally abusive. Extreme jealousy, controlling who I hung out with, would cheat on me and make it seem as though it was my fault. He tried getting me pregnant at 17.
He punched a wall near my head one night. He used his alcoholism as a crutch and an excuse to play the victim card and explain his behavior. He hurt my dog. He made horrific remarks about my body.

It's triggering for me when my husband drinks heavily now because he always smelled of alcohol.

My sister and I used to joke about how I dodged a bullet (which I did. I worked for the public defender for a short time and found a file on him - OD'd on heroin and crashed into a building). We were chatting about our poor choices in men when we were younger. I half jokingly said ""I wonder if he's still alive."" Only half joking because he had cirrhosis at 22. I looked him up and found out he died 4 years ago from an overdose. Someone found him in his apartment. I dont know how long he'd been dead before they found his body.

And so many people were grieving him and saying what a wonderful person he was. And I keep thinking about it. I keep thinking about him and trying to forgive him and make light of what he did to me and I keep blaming myself for being so naive and letting it happen. I'm not sad per se.. but I'm bothered by his death. I am nauseated at the thought of him, but I feel like I'm grieving.

Does anyone have experience with this? I just don't know how to process what I'm feeling.

10,Nice-Understanding30,1614123340,"I‚Äôm about to talk about something that happened to me in highschool that I can‚Äôt get off my mind. I don‚Äôt know if this is considered rape and I want answers. 
I was only 15 years old, a freshmen. there was this boy that I went to school with and I thought he was cute so we started snapchating. a week into us snapchating, he kept asking me to send him nude photos. I kept saying no because i knew boys at my school would save girls nudes and share them with everyone... so disgusting. one day he threatened to tell everyone that we had sex if I didn‚Äôt send him nudes. we never had sex and I was only 15 and I didn‚Äôt want people to think I had sex. in fear of being accused of something I never did, I sent them to him. I had this gut feeling that he saved them and I was right. the next day a girl told me that he had my nudes and showed them to her. my stomach dropped. I immediately called my mom to pick me up from school, I was humiliated. that night he continued to snapchat me like nothing happened so I confronted him about it in an angry manner. he told me that if I don‚Äôt meet him outside and give him a bl*w job, he will send my nudes to all my friends. he blackmailed me into doing stuff with him. again in fear of being exposed, I did it. I had never felt so disgusted with myself in my life. I had never done anything beyond kissing with a guy before. I ran to the shower and used half a bottle of body wash. I felt dirty. I remember sitting on the ground in the shower, balling my eyes out. the next day rolls around and I think I just redeemed myself from being exposed. however, that was not the case. I had a big group of girlfriends, maybe about 15 girls. we had this big group chat that we talked in everyday. somehow he managed to get added into the group chat. I just sat there and prayed that he wouldn‚Äôt send these pictures in there. I remember him saying ‚Äúdo you guys want to see something‚Äù. I knew in my heart exactly what he was talking about. I tried to remove him but this one girl kept adding him back. then he sent them... all of my friends saw them. the whole school saw them. all I could think is, ‚ÄúI want to kill myself‚Äù. I was so embarrassed. I went to school the next day and my friends were all saying how sorry they were for me. I didn‚Äôt tell my parents because I was too embarrassed to tell them I sent nude photos. I just handled everything on my own. at the time I didn‚Äôt know how bad it was, how I was manipulated, blackmailed, and exposed. but now 5 years later, I can‚Äôt get it off my mind. i‚Äôm so angry I never did anything back then. all I can think it‚Äôs about how I want to get revenge and justice.

14,confused_twpsyn,1614091631,"Hi again, its your friendly neighbourhood twpsyn. Once again I apologise for any grammar or spelling.

Today I called the NSPCC on my own father. I have really not come to terms yet with my childhood. The more I try to make sense of it the more confused I get, every step I take I feel like I'm hit with more resistance in my own mind.

Why is that relevant, well because it took me 2-3 weeks to build up the guts to call. I am worried about my brother. Last summer during the argument that caused me to cut contact with my father, my younger brother moved back down to his full time.

My brother doesn't remember the bad times as much as I do, and the ones he does he doesn't see anything wrong with. But the reason I called the NSPCC was as I don't think he is eating right, and I think my dad is emotionally manipulating him. By this I mean threatening to cut contact if he starts spending time with my mother

Now these issues don't sound so bad, but having been in his house they feel worse to me. The food thing comes from the complex he instilled in me, that I should choose the cheapest/oldest/least desirable option so my father can have the better stuff.

After being on the phone for over an hour and having to list some of the surface stuff from my childhood trauma, they tell me they can't help. Without my brother telling me, or me seeing marks there is no grounds but my words.

They suggested that I ring my brothers school and inform them of my concern, the problem with that? We went to the same school, the teachers I talk to about him are the same ones who taught me. The thought of riding and spilling my childhood as the reason I am concerned fills me with dread. The only person who really knows what happening with my mental health and treatment in my local, is my mother. To tell others near here, to finally admit to my area that I am broken. I am not strong enough to do it

But to not do it, to keep silent, it might allow my father to get away with it again. Me being a selfish coward might condemn my brother to what I tried to protect him from

I was trapped and terrified and I leaned on this other man (let's call him Aaron). I told him what I was dealing with. I moved out and went to college. I got close to Aaron. I ended up dating Aaron because he manipulated me into believing he could keep me safe (that this was the \*only\* way I would be safe). He was manipulative. He was terrible. He did awful things to me and exploited my trauma. I wasn't the only victim- he was doing it to another survivor of abuse simultaneously, that I didn't recognize until after therapy and years of distance. 

Aaron made it hard to leave. I kept trying. He kept finding new ways to pull me back and it took me way too long to escape. I would block him online. He would use a new method. When I had blocked him on everything, he drove 8 hours and showed up at my parents at 3am when I was there. He would send snail mail to my address to apologize. Things like this.

I finally got out. 1.5 years later he used a new number and contacted me and left a message begging for me to be there to support him because he was suicidal. I blocked that number too and ignored it. At that point, I had blocked him on all social media I had at the time. I graduated college, I moved. I thought it was all in the past.

He contacted me on Instagram today. My account has a fake name (same first, fake last). We should have no mutual friends. We should be at least 700 miles from each other. He said he wanted to ""apologize"" and that the ""sign"" he got was that Instagram suggested my account to follow. I feel like that's bullshit. 

The message is an ""apology"" (though the second half is all excuses, justifications, and a plea to open up communication again). I blocked him on Instagram too, obviously.

But now I'm a mess. I feel like I've been mentally pulled back. This ordeal with Aaron and the man before him who raped me have affected me all this time. I was finally diagnosed with PTSD from it all which answered a lot in terms of how I was impacted in my daily life. 

I am afraid. I don't know if it's rational to be afraid. Like...it could have been a real apology? But given how manipulative he was with pulling me back before...I don't believe that. I'm not going to talk to him, either way. I just don't know if it's fair to be afraid...whether I should do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I wanted third party opinions... whether it sounds like I should do more or what steps I should take. I've just blocked him on Instagram, which should be the last platform where he wasn't blocked previously...

20,Suffering777,1614048459,"For the background

I used to be timid and silent person.

My extended father family (age 60 - 70) like to compare me with their children since i was teenager. They always said that i :

- I can't speak eloquently (unable to make small talk) to people compare to their family

- They like to compare me with their children, why i'm not smart and great compare to their family.

- I can't speak chinese well ( i used to study japanese, it just i dont have talent learning language) compare to their child. ( their child speak chinese well)


My father family said they only give advise and want the best for me. My father sometimes quite upset and blame me because his family said my parent cannot teach me well.

I always holding my anger when they insulting me.

When i'm 24 i had girlfriend, quite serious. I'm planning to married her. I already had sex with her. We losing virginity together and i promise i will marry her. 

My mistake is introducing her to my father family. They said my girlfriend is person without politeness/manner.

They started making my parent hate my girlfriend by saying :

- my gf playing phone = no politeness, 
(she dont know what to said my father family, so she playing with her phone.)

- my gf not smart and cant make small talk with other people compare to their children.

 - she staying together with me in my room. She live in another town, and when she come to my town. She live in my house. My house have 2 building. She and her sister used to sleepover in my room.

My parent don't see this as a problem. However when my dad extended family know this fact, they accuse my girlfriend as woman without manner .

Yes i know asian countries had outdated view regarding people sleeping in room. 

My father family call my parent ask them to come to their place. Then they started insulting , screaming at my parent , they call me and my girlfriend as person without manner.

They also said that my parent spoiling me to much. No person in my dad family dare to insult me because im the most spoiled person in my father family.

They also said that my personality changed since i met my gf. That my gf made me person without manner and didnt love my parent. 

My mom crying and my father come back home screaming, punching table and everything, while saying i bring shame to my parents.

In the end my father family said that i need to choose one : my girlfried or my father family.




The result is shitstorm. Me and my parent and girlfriend had a huge fight. 
My parent hate me, my gf dont want to see me and my family again.


My fight with my parents last for 1 year. I almost commit suicide (almost drink pesticide) , everyday i screaming crying in my room, sometimes in my car. It feels like i lost everything, my gf and parent hate me.

I didnt speak my parent for 6 months, my mom cried everyday. There is a time I screaming at my parents and said to them hurtful things. Like i wish i was adopted since baby, making my mom cried. I grow resentful with my toxic dad family. 

Since this event 6 years ago, i become quite short tempered. My relationship with parents quite strained. Sometimes i lashing out and screaming at my parents.

 I cut off my father extended family and insulting them in return. Some of them hate me because of this.

 The positive thing is they stop insulting me in front of my family since they hate that i insulting them in return now. 


So practically, i disowned my father family.

6 years, I still unable to meet someone compatible as my ex. Met some girl but not as good compared to my ex. And this made me hate myself,  regretting my decision introducing my gf to my father family.


Just months ago, i heard my father family confuse why i angry. They don't understand why i get mad and hate them.

In the end, my father family said they sorry and said they only try giving me advise, because i'm only son in family. They dont want me to choose wrong person. 
The said they said rude thing as encouragement to push me to improve as a better person.

They said i'm too sensitive as a person and i should be stronger and not angry when given advise by my father family.

They said that i should start over as a new person and contact/meet my father family again. They want me to turn new person , kind and not angry when they insulting me.

6 years , I'm still remembering everything, my relationship with my exe from start until end.
Sometimes i wish i die.

This make me thinking everything that happen 6 years ago. They said that I'm losing my gf as an gods will and i should be thankful to my father family. 

I'm thinking suicide everyday.

My ex just married months ago, made me hate my life

I keep remembering our memories as the happiest moment in my life.

 I keep looking at our photos together in my laptop.  Relieving moment that i spent together witb her.

 I also keep reading diaries that i wrote when i still together with her.  I still remember exact date when we first kiss.

Please help any advise...

21,LonelyNotOnly,1614038488,"I wont go into detail but I was sexually abused by my older half brother from when I was about 7 to when i was 11. Noone in my family knows.

I have another brother that I'm close to and luckily for me the brother in question is a bastard in other ways and has basically abandoned dads side of the family and we havent seen him in a long time.
My dad was talking to me today, saying how he feels like he failed us. That his oldest son (the abuser) hates him, and how my other brother is ignoring his advice and isnt paying for his child among other things. He basically said I was the only one that has made smart choices and taken his advice and how he loves us all equally but he feels like he was bad at parenting boys and how proud he is of e because he feels like he cant take credit.

Now my dad is amazing, I didnt tell him about the abuse but that was on me not him, he was supportive of everything we wanted to do and always made time for us. I even remember going to his work after school and making meetings with his secretary so we could have coffee and chat and he never made me feel like I was interrupting something more important though looking back that's why he had to work from home on sunday afternoons. 
My other brother is being an idiot at the moment but hes also been diagnosed with something in his brain that makes him hyper emotional and hes struggling getting a dose right for his meds and it's making it super hard to talk to him because hes either like void of feelings or super sensitive all the time. Hes always had an issue with money because of what's wrong with him and not being diagnosed he didnt have the tools to control it. So that's not my dads fault. I think if it was only that then dad would be okay but he feels like both his sons have turned away from him and I cant exactly, after all this time, tell him that it's not his fault because one is a psychopath and always has been. 

Recently I've been thinking about telling him, because I want to visit for longer than just a weekend but whenever om there a while I get paranoid that my abuser will ""pop in"" to see dad. Because while they dont generally talk  he does sometimes blow hot and cold depending on who can do him a favour. I thought it would help my anxiety to talk to him but after that conversation I dont want to hurt him any more than he is, he basically said that I was the reason he knew he hadnt failed in life so if I told him I was abused and he didnt know? What would he think then.... 

This is more of a rant than anything, please be gentle to me and my poor dad in any comments if anyone wants to say anything.

He had been at the pub all day so came home drunk and furious, fairly common practise.

He grabbed one of my brothers and a shotgun, went outside and shot all three dogs. He had my brother digging a grave for the dogs as he did so.

He then had my brother kneel down, put the shotgun in my brothers mouth and told him he would shoot him were he not his own flesh and blood.

My brother managed to get away, I had heard gun shots, then the doors slamming, then crying, so I went downstairs to see what was going on.

I pray I never again have to see anyone look how my brother looked. It was looking at a face of sheer horror. It would break your heart to see it.

My ma got my brother in the car and drove away, I was left with my younger brothers, she told me to call my aunt or the police if my da came back into the house.

I got my younger brothers into one room together and tried to keep them calm. They knew something was wrong, but none of us knew exactly what had happened.

My da came back into the house an hour or so later, he came upstairs and into the room, he picked up my youngest brother who was crying and cradled him, saying he didn't mean to do it etc... I managed to sneak out of the room eventually and call my aunt.

My aunt told me she would be with us in half an hour and to get my brothers ready and down the driveway and she'd get us from there.

She arrived with my eldest brother who was holding a baseball bat. He went into the house to remove any more shotgun cartridges.

It was all OK, he was back in a few minutes and we all went to my aunts house.

My older brother had taken a fair amount of valium and was peaceful. We got my younger brothers tucked into my aunts bed. I went to the bathroom and broke down.

A few minutes later my eldest brother came in, picked me up off the floor and told me I couldn't cry because my little brothers would hear me and get upset (my aunts place was a one bedroom apartment).

I want to keep this short and to the point. When an adult is in a relationship with someone who physically harms them, isolates them, manipulates them, it's an abusive relationship. 

Now, can anyone tell me, is the same true of a relationship between two 13 year olds? I just need to know. I have found lots of information about COCSA but what about physical and emotional abuse? Is it even a thing? Can I even hold her responsible in my mind? She was a kid. The damage happened though. The physical evidence would have been enough to remove a child from a parent if it had been them... So what even is this? 

Is my brain just not accepting it? Am I overthinking it? We were both kids, but now as an adult I still have nightmares about her... So was this abuse? There seems to be such clear indicators when it's an adult situation, so why am I having such a hard time with this?

Hey guys, hope everything has been going ok with you guys. For those who don‚Äôt know my CSA story, basically I (21F) was sexually assaulted multiple times ages 6-8 by my 14-16M babysitter. Recently, especially with COVID I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how I have always absolutely hated going to the doctor. This has been going on for as long as I can remember... I‚Äôm 21 now and haven‚Äôt been to a doctor in 10 years, and the last time was only because I had severe pneumonia and was forced to. I absolutely hate everything about it. A person looking extremely closely at me. I can‚Äôt stand getting shots. I know it doesn‚Äôt hurt that bad but I can‚Äôt STAND it for some reason. Last time I went when I was 11 I sobbed and honestly probably will again if I have to go anytime soon. I have an extreme distrust in the medical system and any medication for some reason. There‚Äôs really no foreseeable reason why. Even with cramps or a headache I‚Äôll just sit here and suffer or turn to natural remedies. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever suffered from medical abuse of any sort but then again, it took me 12 years to remember anything about my babysitter. If I ended up in a major accident or needed surgery of any sort I seriously don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do. I just started crying while thinking about it while writing this. Just the thought of laying in a hospital bed makes me want to die. My boyfriend got a few stitches last summer when he cut his arm pretty deep and I just couldn‚Äôt even fathom it. It made me cry so hard thinking of what he had to go through. It made me realize how weak I was. 

I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here. Other people seem to go to the doctor and get surgery like it‚Äôs no big deal. I don‚Äôt rule out being medically mistreated because apparently I was in and out of the hospital a lot as a baby, but honestly I don‚Äôt think it could be that because my mom monitored me very closely in the hospital. I think it might have more to do with the general distrust of caretakers? My obvious dislike of being exposed and vulnerable to others? I did make another post about how I absolutely hate being touched by ANYONE except my boyfriend?

He grabbed the collar of my shirt and ripped it in half so hard it cut my neck.

I do have a few memories of him, but they‚Äôre all unpleasant. And I can‚Äôt *actually* remember them, I just remember the moments surrounding them? If that makes sense.

Here‚Äôs an example.
I remember this one time, he had me come upstairs to his room (everyone else was downstairs) &amp; gives me alcohol. I don‚Äôt remember walking up the stairs or the moment of alcohol consumption but I do have a split-second image of where I‚Äôm standing, next to the bed facing him, but it‚Äôs so fuzzy and brief, I really just remember where in the room my feet were placed as I faced him.

I also remember thinking about how my head felt swimmy then as I sat down, &amp; now that i‚Äôve drank alcohol on many more occasions I can recognize that was an indicator that I probably drank quite an amount or that it was strong.. &amp; even though I don‚Äôt remember what happened, I get this feeling of unease swelling in my chest when I think about it. I start holding my breath too. Adding that because I just noticed I was unintentionally holding my breath &amp; tensing my body while typing that.

I‚Äôm scared he may have done awful things to me. I kinda wish I remembered, so I could feel valid &amp; know for sure instead of always wondering. I will also mention that this dude is confirmed fucking insane &amp; the reason communication stopped with him was because he went to prison for raping my mum when she broke up with him, &amp; I do remember instances of him threatening her, so it‚Äôs not too crazy to think he could‚Äôve targeted me too.

She took me to the hospital and I remember like 3-5 doctors looking at it and wondering what it was. Then, I was sent over to the sexual assault center, where I was questioned for hours. I remember the doctors saying, ‚Äúthings like this don‚Äôt just come up out of nowhere, but if you tell us who did this to you, we can help you.‚Äù After like five hours of me saying nothing happened, they let me go home. I didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt remember anything happening. I remember hearing that my herpes test was negative, but I have no idea if they ran any other test.

4. I remember when my mom told me I had to start wearing a bra, I refused for years. I was ashamed of my chest and did my best to hide it. I have no idea why. I remember my dad poking fun at me once when he hugged me before school and felt my bra on my back. My mom even had a doctor talk to me about it, who like totally shamed me for not wearing a bra. This went on from 6th-8th grade before I finally just gave in. 

5. In high school, I started dating boys. I‚Äôd date them for weeks and refuse to even kiss them. They tried and my body just pulled away in panic.

6. Eventually I was at a party and a girl kissed me. It was like, oh okay cool, I‚Äôll let a girl kiss me. I‚Äôm 28 now and still have only dated (or even kissed) girls, which I‚Äôm fine with. 

7. Sex usually makes me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt mind doing things to other people but when they do something to me, I just force myself to try to be normal and let it happen

However last night, my girlfriend and I were ...y‚Äôknow. I started getting this urge to run away, to stop her, I couldn‚Äôt tell if I wanted to cry or puke, but I didn‚Äôt feel right. Eventually I just jumped off of the bed and ran to the bathroom and started bawling. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in the present, I was somewhere else. My girlfriend was trying to calm me down and talk to me and I kept jumping because I thought she was someone else, but I don‚Äôt know who. I was in a flashback but had no visual. I remember just crying and finally saying ‚ÄúI think something bad happened to me.‚Äù

Today I was watching Netflix and there was a sex scene and I had to turn it off immediately. I‚Äôve been pretty dissociated all day. 

I mentioned most of this to my therapist in the past, and we never spoke of it again. I think she just knows my window of tolerance and assumes I will bring it up again when I‚Äôm ready. We really have to tip-toe through my memories because I tend to dissociate big-time, I‚Äôll lose hours, etc.


Idk what I‚Äôm saying or asking but I don‚Äôt know what any of this means and I feel afraid.",survivorsofabuse,Slivers of memories that are imply that there is a sexual aspect to my childhood abuse?,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/lpeisz/slivers_of_memories_that_are_imply_that_there_is/,1613937526.0
32,Few-Biscotti-9613,1613956232,"I recently heard the story of a woman who was sexually abused as a child, but had absolutely no memory of it until her later twenties. Her memories of the events were completely suppressed and only came back to her slowly after her marriage with her husband. 

I don't know the exact psychology behind it, but I'm starting to worry about the possibility that this could be the case for myself. The way she was describing her life/attitude/behavior before the memories came back is strikingly similar to my own. 

As a really young kid (1-10 years old) I spent a lot of my time at my grandmother's. She would watch us while my mother worked, but since she was also my neighbor, I could come over to her place at any time. 

Her son (my uncle) still lived with her during this time. At some point that I can't remember and am afraid to ask my parents about, my dad found photos of child pornography in my uncle's room. I don't know the exact details, but it turned out he was sexually abusing his two daughters for years. His daughters didn't live with him, but they would visit sometimes and we'd hang out together. He went to prison, I don't know when he will be out. My family never talks about it.

What scares me is that my childhood has always been a blur to me, especially when it comes to my grandmother's. I spent so much of my time there, and I practically remember nothing. What I do remember comes in extremely vivid snapshots of irrelevant, mundane stuff. And for some reason, my overall aura of the place is negative, but of the memories I do have, none are negative.

What also scares me is that I display many of the behaviors of someone who suppresses memories and emotions. I have anxiety issues, and was in therapy for a year after having a break down because I was hiding for five years how much I hated being in Boy Scouts from my parents. That period caused an extreme amount of stress on me all because I couldn't bring myself to quit, and I still do not know why. It wasn't an issue with my parents or the people in the organization; I just had an extreme fear of confrontation that I can't explain. Maybe it's because I have a slight aversion to men, which I also can't explain.

But even though I have an aversion to men, and do not like being around men, I'm gay. Or I'm not. I'm not sure, my sexuality has been really conflicting over time. I used to only be attracted to guys, purely guys, but in recent months that has changed and I've started being able to feel sexually attracted to women. I do not know why this is. The internet seems to explain it could be tied to trauma, though, which is why I'm mentioning it. 

Also, using \[this\]([https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/were-you-sexually-abused-as-a-child.htm](https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/were-you-sexually-abused-as-a-child.htm)) website, I check off a majority of the boxes for stuff that they list as possible symptoms of sexual abuse/memory loss. 

I don't want this to be true. I don't want this to be the reason for so many of the problems and experiences in my life. But it hits too close to home to not question.

Any advice? Have any of you guys experienced repression of your abuse that you had no idea ever occurred until after it came back randomly?

33,Icy-Ad-9567,1613938131,"First of all, I'd like to give a disclaimer that this happened almost a decade ago, and my memory of what happened is a bit spotty in places. This is everything I remember to the best of my ability:

When I was seven, a therapist that I was seeing did some questionable things. It started with her basically trying to control the amount of toilet paper I used. Then she wouldn't let me lock the door when I used the bathroom and started watching me use the bathroom. This progressed to her one day walking in and insisting that I needed ""help"" wiping myself up. I had been wiping myself up for years at this point, and she had never needed to ""help"" me before, so it felt wrong. I told her that I didn't need help and asked her to leave, but she insisted. She proceeded to force herself on me and wipe me up. Well, I say ""force"" but really I didn't physically fight back. I only verbally protested. I'd like to note that she used a VERY skimpy amount of toilet paper and I remember that the wiping was slow (I don't know how else to describe it). It was almost like she was drawing it out on purpose (but then again I couldn't read her mind and tell you for sure what her intentions were.) There was always paper between her hand and my genitals, and nothing else but the wiping that I described happened. Also, the wiping incident only happened once because afterwards I refused to go to the bathroom ever again at the therapy place.

I do know without a doubt that this was abusive behavior, but what kind of abuse would this classify as.",survivorsofabuse,What kind of abuse was this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/lp5efn/what_kind_of_abuse_was_this/,1613909331.0
34,exatheus,1613937353,"I was about 12 when it happened, only a couple weeks before my birthday, and I was with someone that was my best friend. I talked to them about my past trauma (which I already had by having a ""sexy body"" at the age of 8) and how my parents dismissed it.

I'll call that friend Lia. I'll keep it as vague as humanly possible, because as much as my friends know about this, they don't know who did it.

I already knew I was queer, at that time, and had a crush on them. They showed themself very uncomfortable at the topic, so I didn't say anything, because I thought it'd make me look pushy.

Until that day came.

I was with Lia, and another friend who I'll call Miles.

Miles, Lia and I were in Lia's room, Miles was sitting on one bed, Lia and I on another, and we were all talking. The subject suddenly changed into sex. We all talked abt how we didn't have any experience.

This part of my brain is blank, I can only remember Lia getting on top of me, and I wasn't too bothered, right? They were my crush, after all. Eventually, Lia went on top of Miles as well.

Miles seemed just as bothered as me, which was not at all, but as it progressed, Lia going back and forth between us, I started getting uncomfortable, and asked them to stop. They didn't.

Now, real talk? I'm way stronger than Lia. I've had a naturally strong body (plus years of playing wrestle against my brother who's over a decade older than me) so I could've pushed them away, and stopped them.

But I didn't. I was scared, frozen, wanting to cry, feeling my energy get drained out, I was being betrayed as I asked them to stop and they looked at me without moving anything but their hips.

When they got up again, turning to Miles, I ran out, I stopped at the door, looking back as things progressed with Miles and Lia, he looked uncomfortable, also scared. He also could've punched Lia unconscious.

None of us did.

Because of a single phrase Lia had said.

""If you pull me away, I'll start doing this at school too.""

Time skip over to summer break. I broke all contact I had with Lia.

They texted me in the one place I hadn't blocked them.

And they sent me a PDF file, making up a DID alter (which I know wasn't real because 1. I have friends with DID that told me the excuse was BS; and 2. They only mentioned that alter when they had done something wrong; and last, 3. that only started like, 2 weeks before the Incident) and saying that they'd understand if I wanted to keep away.

They very much did not understand, because when break ended, they picked the place (in class) right beside my friends.

After I told my friends to not talk to them, they went into the principal's office to accuse us of bullying.

After I left school for over 7 months because I was in risk of su\*cide, they threatened to beat my friends. Which were, again, all stronger than them, but they were loved by the principal, even though students HATED their guts, so they were untouchable.

That's not all that Lia did, don't get me wrong. They did a lot more before the COCSA incident happened, but those were the ones that followed my abuse incident.

And when I tried to tell my therapist.

He told me I was overreacting.",survivorsofabuse,"Just joined, I needed to talk about this. (COCSA)",https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/lp543w/just_joined_i_needed_to_talk_about_this_cocsa/,1613908553.0

38,Kirrel,1613915614,"The fact that I have to use a throwaway in fear that if she were to find out I have said these things that she would retaliate should speak volumes.

My relationship with my family has not always been well... perfect. But growing up it was mostly fine. That changed though when I become a late teen and then adult. 

It started when I first came out as gay to my mother. She said some callous things but that didn't bother me as much as what she did when she found out about my first boyfriend. She had a habit of cyberstalking me online and when she found out about my long distance relationship boyfriend... she tracked him down, threatened him to stay away from me and then tried to get him kicked out of his chances of joining the millitary (this was before the repeal of DADT) by telling his recruiter that he was gay.

This was only the first of well... difficult behavior. After that she cyberstalked me all the time and if i posted something online she disagreed with or i had a friend she didn't like she would shame me and try to get that to change. She tried to control my relationships and my beliefs.

There were other brief periods of well.... terrible things. She was my payee at first and would shame me and make me feel like shit any time I argued about money with her.

But then when I became my own payee and was able to start transition as I realized I was transgender.... that is when things crossed a line into traumatic territory. 

You see, at the time i was very vunerable. The first thing she did was when I came out was for her to tell me to ""check my chromosomes"". Then when she found out I was taking hormones in a time i was most vunerable.... She called during THANKSGIVNG WITH MY DAD'S FAMILY to tell me that she would never see me as her daughter. Like it was bad enough that i was feeling like shit but to be told that especially when i was around accepting individuals who were celebrating a holiday i like... i have flashbacks often to that with the emotions involved and it really really is difficult for me. 

Furthemore, that christmas she forced me to go in ""boy mode"" when I told her that it would make me miserable and I couldn't stand it. Well just as I had said I felt dysphoria so bad that I couldn't help but cry during christmas. Afterwards she messaged me online to tell me how selfish i was and that i ruined christmas and how horrible I was. Like, I couldn't help how i felt and it almost pushed me to a suicide attempt.

It didn't stop there, she later told me that a friend of hers had heard me practicing my voice and said it sounded ""fake"" and like a gay man and to this day after being made fun of for that I have a hard time practicing making my voice better.

I understand she has c-ptsd from her childhood but that does not excuse what she has done to me. This doesn't even cover it all.

Worse yet, she has been known to get so involved in ""writing wrongs"" that she has torn down people's lives. While some of them were justified, it scares me. I have reoccuring nightmares of her tearing down my life and forcing me to stay with her with all my privileges taken away. At least once a week I have a dream of this and it is so scary that it wakes me up.

Just typing this has me crying and having flashbacks.

The worst thing is that she acts now like she is the best trans advocate and does call me her daughter, but that only rubs the salt on the wounds more. I am genuinely afraid of not saying that I love her and when she tells me i love her i feel forced to reply the same back in fear that she will retaliate against me emotionally.

It is complicated and well... this isn't all of it. 

I don't know what to do. If i were to cut her off I have a feeling she would go back to cyberstalking me and well.... do dramatic things. I'm terrified of that.

39,catscoffees,1613915033,"I never expected how many complicated feelings would surround this. Relief, primarily. Sadness - not for him but for what could have been. He was my grandfather. He abused me for 7 years. He technically has been dead to me for almost 17 years. 

My mother called to let me know and told me she still respected my wishes not to attend his funeral. She had a complicated relationship too because he was a good father to her. But he abused her two children and many of her nieces and nephews. She stopped contact with him but my grandma stayed with him. That was probably the hardest part. It made me hate my grandma for choosing the man who hurt her grandchildren. Any one of her children would have taken her into their homes but she stayed and hoped we would all sweep it under the rug so that we could all continue to be a family. 

I'm almost relieved that his funeral will be occuring during Covid times where there are limited people allowed to attend. His family never knew what happened and continued to adore him for years. I always had fear that his funeral would be a day celebrating the man they thought him to be and not the monster he really was. Thankfully now it will essentially be a religious mass with no eulogy. My mother will be writing the obituary and has promised me there will be no words of loving grandfather or my or my children's names listed. 

I feel like I'm at a crossroads. I've been hoping he would die for years. I know that sounds terrible but what he did to me was unforgivable. But now that he's dead I almost don't feel any different?

I don't feel like saying all the things my parents said to me that finally did it for me, other than besides the screaming and namecalling they think im going to hell. today in a phone call with my brother and SIL I texted my SIL about the sexual abuse of my brother without mentioning specifics and talked to my brother and SIL about my moms anger and matts anger. But.. I just wanted to warn you that validation will probably not come in the way you seek. Its one thing for me to have talked to friends when I was young to self-soothe before I learned coping skills. But I held onto these secrets for between 33 and 25 yrs depending on the abuse. It was SUCH a big deal. I kept a self just for my family, performed for them, pretended. Sometimes anger came out. And then there was my own hurting but liberal, pagan, bisexual self. They did know we just didnt talk about it, im not 37 and pretending im conservative, but i did listen to them go on.

But.. I feel empty after telling my brother about the anger and such, and my SIL about the sexual. I know I didn't go into specifics but there was no big reaction other than ""Im sorry."" I think validation must come from within. Unfortunately, I found out my brother has severe chronic suicidal ideation and a lot of the insecurities I do so Im not stepping away entirely.

I have never told anyone about this, until this summer. My girlfriend was opening up to me about sexual trauma she had experienced, and I told her about what happened to me as a child. We had a very in depth conversation about trauma, and how it effects us to this day. I really bonded with her over this and was the first and only time I have talked about these issues with anyone. 

Now almost 6 months later we are having an argument, and she goes off on me for a while about how I have no clue what its like to experience ""real"" trauma.

UPDATED:¬†Brendan Fraser is joining the #MeToo movement, coming forward on Thursday with allegations of sexual assault by an ex-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

In a new interview with¬†GQ, ‚ÄúThe Mummy‚Äù star alleges that the¬†HFPA‚Äôs Philip Berk assaulted him at the Beverly Hills Hotel in the summer of 2003.

‚ÄúHis left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around,‚Äù the actor said. Berk recounted the incident in his memoir ‚ÄúWith Signs and Wonders,‚Äù but said he pinched Fraser‚Äôs behind as a joke.¬†According to Fraser, though, it wasn‚Äôt a joke, and he was overcome with fear and had to remove Berk‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúI felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry,‚Äù he says. He rushed home and told his wife about the encounter, but was afraid to go public with the incident as, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to contend with how that made me feel, or it becoming part of my narrative.‚Äù

Fraser, through his reps, asked the HFPA for an apology, which Berk says he wrote, but¬†added ‚ÄúMy apology admitted no wrongdoing, the usual ‚ÄòIf I‚Äôve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologize.‚Äô‚Äù Berk, who took a¬†six-month leave of absence¬†from the HFPA in April 2014 following backlash from his memoir but is still a member, denied the claim in an e-mail to GQ, saying ‚ÄúMr. Fraser‚Äôs version is a total fabrication

¬†Hollywood Foreign Press Association responded in a statement that reads:

‚ÄúThe HFPA stands firmly against sexual harassment and the type of behavior described in this article. Over the years we‚Äôve continued a positive working relationship with Brendan, which includes announcing Golden Globe nominees, attending the ceremony and participating in press conferences. This report includes alleged information that the HFPA was previously unaware of and at this time we are investigating further details surrounding the incident.‚Äù

The actor said that the incident made him reclusive and he retreated from public life. He questioned if the HFPA blacklisted him as a result, since he was rarely invited back to the Golden Globes, which the HFPA runs, after 2003. He believes it‚Äôs partly why his career derailed, and said ‚ÄúThe phone does stop ringing in your career, and you start asking yourself why. There‚Äôs many reasons, but was this one of them? I think it was.‚Äù

Fraser added that he was emboldened to come forward by the #MeToo and Time‚Äôs Up movements, saying ‚ÄúI know Rose [McGowan], I know Ashley [Judd], I know Mira [Sorvino] ‚Äî I‚Äôve worked with them. I call them friends in my mind. I haven‚Äôt spoken to them in years, but they‚Äôre my friends. I watched this wonderful movement, these people with the courage to say what I didn‚Äôt have the courage to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I still frightened? Absolutely. Do I feel like I need to say something? Absolutely. Have I wanted to many, many times? Absolutely. Have I stopped myself? Absolutely,‚Äù Fraser said in the interview. ‚ÄúMaybe I am over-reacting in terms of what the instance was. I just know what my truth is.‚Äù

In the GQ piece Fraser also discussed the physical dangers of stunt work, which he described as ‚Äúdestructive,‚Äù particularly for the three ‚ÄúMummy‚Äù films he starred in. By the time he was working on the series‚Äô third film in 2008,¬† ‚ÄúI was put together with tape and ice‚Ä¶ I was building an exoskeleton for myself daily.‚Äù Eventually these injuries resulted in multiple surgeries, including a laminectomy, a partial knee replacement, back and vocal cord surgeries that amounted to seven years in and out of hospitals.

‚ÄúI felt like the horse from ‚ÄòAnimal Farm,‚Äô¬†whose job it was to work and work and work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOrwell wrote a character who was, I think, the proletariat. He worked for the good of the whole, he didn‚Äôt ask questions, he didn‚Äôt make trouble until it killed him. ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve been sent to the glue factory, but I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve had to rebuild s‚Äî that I‚Äôve built that got knocked down and do it again for the good of everyone.

_______________________________________________________

I don't feel like a lot of my trauma was severe enough. I have 2 trauma based diagnoses, yet I don't have as many symptoms that everyone else does. I barely reach a minimum requirements for diagnoses.

I feel like my eating disorder isn't bad enough. I used to eat one meal a day for like 2 years and I was still always a healthy weight.

My partner had a severe case of anorexia nervous and bulimia that made periods stop, hair fall out, nails brittle, and cause ulcers. Hospitalized and monitored once in a treatment center.

I feel like I wasn't sexually abused enough. My partner suffered from emotional incest, incestuous and chronic childhood rape and molestation, from age 3-5 probably until 8-10 and then emotional incest until moved out. Also sexually abused by partners and people are parties and gatherings well past that.

My roommate faced very extreme abuse of every kind of abuse you can imagine, quiet and loud, almost like a child called it. And so, so, so much rape from 13 until 21. 

But I feel like I wasn't abused enough. Wasn't raped enough. My eating disorder isn't bad enough. I was raped maybe a couple times as a child, my ED not landing me in the hospital, only beat once, etc. I feel like I need to be more abused.

My mom told me some disturbing gossip today. She was at my dad‚Äôs brother‚Äôs funeral (Raul, made-up name) and happened to see the ex-wife of Raul. The ex-wife told my mom of how my dad‚Äôs youngest brother, Gavin (made up name) tried to molest her granddaughter, who is also the granddaughter of Raul. Raul was never told about the incident because it was presumed he would defend Gavin.

As my mom told me this, my stomach dropped. When I was around five or six, my dad would come up behind me while I was walking down the hallway to my room and would proceed to suck on my ears. I don‚Äôt remember where his hands were during those moments or if anything more ever happened beyond that. All I remember is that I hated it and it didn‚Äôt feel right. After numerous times, I yelled stop and ran to my room and I don‚Äôt recall him doing it again. I still have a relationship with my dad and made a promise to myself to never tell my mom or siblings about what happened. But I‚Äôve never fully trusted him after that. 

Knowing what my dad has done to me, and now hearing what my uncle attempted on Raul‚Äôs granddaughter, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my suspicions about my father being sexually abused are correct. If that‚Äôs the case, it makes me truly sad.

My mom was molested by someone in her family. She did her best to protect us, which is why I will never let her know what happened to me. But I‚Äôm promising myself today, again, that this cycle of abuse within my family stops with me.

57,csa_fuck,1613798031,"I believe that at a very young age something bad happened to me. I don‚Äôt remember what happened specifically but I really do suspect that memory was repressed and tucked away. I suspect it was someone close to my family since that‚Äôs how a good deal of this shit happens.

I do have memories of an older sister grooming/S-abusing me for a period but the details are obviously being omitted. I‚Äôll say though it was methodical, showing xyz material to capture a young boys interest and manipulating me into doing xyz and keeping it to myself.

Generally speaking I did not want to be touched growing up, i would say I had a bit of an eating disorder, I suspect I am hyper sexual as a result, major trust issues, I remember my mom repeatedly asking me throughout my childhood if someone did something to me and I used to get so frustrated about saying no. It was like she knew and needed me to say something but I always felt too ashamed to say anything. Also I remember being a sort of depressed loner kid at times. I remember as a child contemplating certain things and ultimately ruling out any drastic measures for the sake of friends and family but later in life I know it is a miracle I am still alive today! Overall, I have been reflecting on all of this privately for about 10 years. I am starting to realize I‚Äôm lucky that I am only as fucked up as I am and not much more.

I am as curious as I am afraid of getting to the truth of the event this took place super early on in my life.

58,magicalboy-throwaway,1613795342,"Hello everyone, this is a very hard question to ask. I wanted to know if what I experienced as a child is considered csa, and if not if there's another word that can more accurately describe it. I don't want to trivialize the experiences of csa survivors so that is why I wanted to ask. I was never, to my knowledge, physically touched inappropriately as a child, but still I experienced things that were very much inappropriate and that I would say has traumatized me and had an impact on me even in my adult life. Since I wasn't physically touched I don't want to compare my experiences to people who were. I know that what happened to me was very wrong, and I would like to have a word to identify it?

So, the biggest thing right away is that my father had secret cameras around the house that he would watch us with. We know for sure that he had one in my sister's room, as my mom found the tapes and has proof. He would watch her get undressed and do various other activities. We know that they were in multiple rooms of the house including the living room and my parents bedroom, but I'll never know if he had one in my room. It haunts me not being sure. This has had a profound effect on my life. I'm constantly afraid that I'm being watched, and I've developed various delusions related to this. The biggest being that he can read my mind, which effects me at all hours of the day, always having to do things to ""prevent"" this from happening. I'm always scared that he's monitoring my devices, and I've always thoroughly checked my room for cameras. I've always put bells on my door so I can hear if someone's coming in at night, but it seems my parents have gotten better at opening it without the bells making noise, which scares me.

There are Tons of instances where he was Obvious disgusting creep to my sister, which is solid proof that he is in fact a pedophile, but that's not my story to tell. All I know is that he never touched Me physically but he probably did with her. 

My mother has also always been extremely inappropriate with me, again not physically. But all my life she has been very uncomfortably open about sex, and has told me things about sex when I was really young and had no business knowing. She would tell me about her sex life, she would tell me details about how she liked being spanked and whatnot. She would behave in very disgusting ways, for instance, when i couldn't have been older than 9, she called me in to show me a picture of some nipple tassels she had bought on ebay. Another time when I was around the same age she showed me an electric paddle thing that she liked to be spanked with. She would tell me random facts about sex out of the blue when I didn't ask. I knew where babies came from in detail by the time I was 6. Around the same age I could tell you what oral sex was and other things of that sort. She would take me to spencer gifts, a store that has various sexual items in the back, and try to show me all the products like blowup dolls. Keep in mind this whole time I was outwardly expressing how much I hated it but she didn't care. 

She told me sexual fantasies in detail like how she wanted a three way with two men. And one of the most traumatic parts that was her and my father would have sex very loudly knowing that I was in the room right next door and could hear everything. This happened from around the time i was 10-16. I even complained about how loud they were being and how upset it made me but they told me to get over it and that I had to deal with it. Now I still can't hear the sound of a whip or ruler, or similar things, because the sound of the spanking was that loud. 

I've never wanted to be alone with my father, I've always been afraid. And it wasn't under recently that it really just hit me that my mother did was also really inappropriate and had an effect on me. I've always been really uncomfortable, and Angry about her doing this, but it's like I didn't realize how much weight I was carrying until now. I'm holding such anger against both of them, but my mother has always fell over herself being guilty about how she didn't ~protect her children~ from my father, and is still with him even now, however I wish that I could have been protected from my mom's behavior too.

Right, addressing my past. In 2017 I was involved with someone who I loved. He was my world. I'd gave anything to be with him. I was in love. Hopelessly always unaware of anything. I was fooled, I never thought I was being manipulated or abused. I did anything he told me too. Pose in suggestive manners? I did it. Want me to VC him while I showered? I did. I did anything for him. I was too blind to realize. I was being abused. He had me wrapped around his finger. The first red flags showed, when he had to break up with me because he wanted to help his girlfriend from a breakdown. He was friends with her for a long time. I was so in love with him that he'll want to help someone through a tough time. But it all changed when he said he might break up with me if things get worse. I didn't like this, truly because helping an old friend wouldn't cause you to break up with the girl you loved, right? Well, I was wrong. We had an argument that escalated in me being a ""selfish bitch"" now I don't remember what happened afterwards, but we split up. 

Fast forwards to 2019, I abandoned my old Amino account, I decided to log in after a few years of inactivity. I logged on, and here he was. He told me it was him and that he got his account ""banned"" this was the third time his account got banned. I then got texts saying. 

""Baby are you alive?""

""Baby?""

""Hello?""

When I responded. He was shocked to hear from me again and stated he ""missed"" me. (If you want proof of this convo I can fetch it.) I of course believed it and we conversed. I after all missed him as well. I secretly dated him behind my current girlfriend/boyfriends back Seki (Who later on didn't care). After awhile things were good. Until he asked me for nudes. He was ""grounded"" from his phone and his mom was out. So we kinda VC and he called it a ""one time thing"" I, understandably was devastated. I missed him even though he took advantage of me. RED (His username at the time) was my boyfriend. I was too blinded to even understand what I was doing was illegal, what I was doing was ""toxic"" what I was in was ""abusive"" I was in love. This relationship happened for awhile. He was obsessed with how ""Fat"" I was. He encouraged me to eat more. And told me to ""rub my belly"" I was... I was disgusted. Back then I was insecure about my weight but he assured me it was lovely. I kept eating. I might die because of him. Later on, I found out he had a fetish for it. Then towards the end of 2019. I snapped out of it. I told him, I don't want to do this. I remember he said.

""You never limit yourself, why can't you have fun?""

Thinking of that made me sick. I just told him I don't want to do it. I typed another response but he blocked me. I was abused for years and I excused this behavior because I loved him.

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but hell.

A while back I broke up with a long-term partner. We were together about 4 years and a year into the relationship, we were arguing in his car and he grabbed my hair and began hitting me. It happened in a split second and he immediately apologized and started crying. I was too stunned. The next morning I said we had to break up. We had been friends a long time before we started dating and he begged me not to break up with him but I didn't know how we could continue. A few weeks later after endless calls, I relented and said if he went into anger management and individual therapy, we could slowly begin again. He did both and we continued, but I spent the rest of the relationship resenting him and bringing up when I felt like he had been verbally abusive. I should've just ended it and eventually I did.

After we broke up, we would see each other every now and then on friendly terms. He is a Ph.D. student at an Ivy League University and told me he has become involved with gender equity initiatives and enrolled as a consent advocacy and relationship education tutor. When I brought up the obvious, he told me ""he has never hit me and that never happened"" I was too stunned for words.. He was literally in anger management and would tell me ""I don't want to feel like a criminal for hitting you."" His matter-of-factly lying and gaslighting was the final straw in our relationship.

My brother found my vibrator in the bathroom when he got home from school because I forgot to put it back in my room.
I live at home and am 19. 
He is 16. 
Our Mum was at work still. 
He kept on running around with it and not giving it to me.
I convinced him that it was a massager. 
He then said that he used it to pleasure himself. 
He then came in my room and looked in my cupboard and said that I had Vaseline lip balm to use for lube. 
He then again reminded me he pleasured himself with it.
He went away and then said well if it‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs actually a vibrator don‚Äôt use it because you could get pregnant because I used it. 

If you‚Äôve read my posts before you‚Äôll see that he hits me everyday. 
I feel like a faker because I‚Äôm not left with bruises. 
He‚Äôll hold me by my hair while he punches me and kicks me.
I feel like a terrible person because right now and for a long time all I‚Äôve wanted to do is just do it back to him, just pin him down and fucking deck him. 
But I can‚Äôt do it. 
I don‚Äôt know how to fight. 
I slapped him the other day and he came at me 10 times harder. 
My Mum told me once, ‚Äúoh well you do have to admit, Blake you do overreact when he hits you‚Äù 
He hasn‚Äôt for the last couple of days because my Mum threatened him. 
6 days ago she said to him if he hits me again he‚Äôll be thrown out. 
3 days ago he hit me again, and he got another chance. 
In the last week, he‚Äôs grabbed me by the collar twice and torn 2 of my shirts. 
She said he got another chance because when I stole money from her years ago I got multiple chances. 
I didn‚Äôt physically hurt anyone. 
I still shouldn‚Äôt of stolen money, I know. 
So he‚Äôs not hitting me at the moment. 

And you‚Äôll see there‚Äôs been instances of weird sexual things. Like him touching me on on my breasts years ago and talking about how big they are. 
And one time he just showed me this ‚Äúpocket  pussy‚Äù that he made. Like I was just standing in the kitchen and be was like look I made a pussy. 
Like ew you don‚Äôt fucking talk about that with your sister. 
The whole breasts thing happened, sometimes even in front of my Mum. 
She laughed once, saying ‚Äúew that‚Äôs your sister hahah!‚Äù 
He doesn‚Äôt do that anymore but he still hits me and insults me everyday. 

He pulls his shirt out to look like a big belly and tells me how disgusting and fat I am. 

He‚Äôs really angry at me all the time since my guidance councillor involved the police about the stuff I was telling her he was doing. 
He completely denies any of the weird touching. 
My parents don‚Äôt care and they think I‚Äôm lying saying if it really happened I could of stopped it because I‚Äôm fat and ‚Äúdouble his size‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so lost. 
Like it‚Äôs so fucking weird all the shit he‚Äôs pulling. 

After this whole vibrator thing happened this afternoon I went out for a couple of hours. 
I came back and my room had obviously been searched though. All my wardrobe drawers were open. A jar from my cupboard was on my desk. My bedside table drawer was open. 
My Mum said she didn‚Äôt do it. 
Was he looking for the vibrator? 
What for? 

It‚Äôs just so gross and weird. 
I think he‚Äôs really sexually repressed. 
But I mean aren‚Äôt we all? 
Like shouldn‚Äôt he just sort this out himself? 

It was my fault for leaving it in the bathroom. 
But he literally could of just left it there. 
It‚Äôs not like a penis shape or anything it literally looks like it could be a body massager. 

Ugh. 
I need to move out. 
I‚Äôve applied to over 20 jobs and nothing. 
I‚Äôm also in a Covid unaffected area as well.
My parents are divorced and they don‚Äôt like each other either so yeah. 
And I live with my Mum. 
And my brother now lives full time with us. 

He also kicked out dog the other day because it walked past him. 

I‚Äôm sorry to post this here but I really need advice. 
I need to move out but I‚Äôm scared and I have no friends or family either I could stay with. 
And I have no money. 

It makes me feel so unworthy that no one believes me. And I know for a fact if I was skinny people would. 
Even if they don‚Äôt realise it, what they‚Äôre thinking is, oh well she‚Äôs not even attractive so why would anyone even if it was her own brother want to touch her like that. 
Do you know what it‚Äôs like to know no one believes you. 
It‚Äôs really really crushing. 

My mental health is really suffering because of this. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I also am so frustrated with myself because my memory is so fucked up. 
Like I really block out everything. 
I have to write every incident down in my notes otherwise I get gaslit into believing I made it up by my family. 
And then I believe I made it up because I don‚Äôt believe every detail.

I don‚Äôt think my Mum really wants to do the hard parts of mothering anymore.

I posted this in another sub but i think it belongs here So pretty much what the tittle says. He became abusive due to depression (not physical but would ignore me for the whole day refusing to tell me what was wrong, raising his voice and one day even punched his pcs. He would also tell me he had intrusive thoughts of hurting people, even me). He didnt want to go to therapy because mental health is still pretty much taboo in his country and he says ""everyone deals with shit, im not different so i just need to accept it""

He decided he couldnt forget what happened and thinking of me would trigger his anxiety and stress so he dumped me. I twas devastated. I could see myself with him forever.

I try to tell myself that most of the time how people treat other people is a reflection of how they feel about themselves and I want to forgive him and let it go but is so hard and sometimes i jump from ""I understand the depression was a huge factor on his behavior"" to ""how could he treat me like this after all i did for him?? i hope he choke and suffer for the rest of his life"". I dont know what to do to ease my anger and forgive him so I can heal. Im still much in love and i feel like an idiot for this.

65,AkatsukiTenshi,1613707008,"You can see my profile for my previous posts here about my father.

I found the court records from his appeals and it detailed the evidence I was never allowed to see before. I actually wasnt allowed to see or know anything because of my relation to him, in the eyes or the law I am an extention of him. In the eyes of people who used ti be friends, family and neighbors I am guilty by association. (I was literally told by an officer that I had no rights to any information or victim support because I was the accused child and therefore not a victim. Never mind that I was a child who in one 6 month period lost a grandparent figure, a parent, all sense of normalicy, and was shoved into a new reality I had no hand in creating.)

I'm not surprised but still very shaken to find how much of the evidence is in direct opposition to his supposed confession. Such as, If you saw that post you know he said they were talking when an altercation started. Evidence shows she was in bed asleep when he attacked. 

The part that boggles the mind the most for me is his appeal disputes the charge of Unlawful Confinement by arguing that because she locked herself in the bathroom she was killed in and he was trying ti get in from the outside, he cant have confined her and in fact had been attempting to unconfine her.

HE HAD LAWYERS! He had professionals say this as a legitimate legal argument in front of the provincial court of appeal!

Anyway I'm just shaken some, not surprisrd that he lied to serve himself and put himself in the best light possible, but shaken none the less. I think a lot of it is just shock at the blatantness of it and a bit of relief from finally seeing the evidence and having a lot of questions I had answered in a say i never thought I would.",survivorsofabuse,I founs the court records.,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/ln622z/i_founs_the_court_records/,1613678208.0

tydr: I wrote about most of what happened to me as a child and my parents if I should even call them that emotionally abused me and I want to know how to get over it.

when I was 9-10 or in fourth grade I was being bullied by the special ed kids because I was gassy and would tell all of the other kids when I farted because I misunderstood what my mother told me to do and I told my mother that the other kids was calling me beans a thing that rhymes with my last name and what my mother did was tell my step-dad who I thought was my dad and he would make fun of me with it for years on end. I ended up with no self esteem and trust issues. I was a kid who would stand away from others reading a book and cry in bathrooms and hallways. 

my dad would make jokes about me  on my sexuality, gender identity, what I acted. I hid my own sexuality and gender identity from myself and others until I was 18 and 19 and my mother did nothing to stop him and would even join in with him and this would sadly have my brother mixed in too. so when my mother that I had not have to worry about that anymore because he was no living with us anymore that sounded like the biggest joke I have ever heard. 

it gets even worse when I was 16. my mother told me that the guy who raised me and emotionally hurt me was not my real father and had met me when I was a year old. I cried so hard and all I could think of is that is why he doesn't love me I am not his child.

I had gotten my first boyfriend a christian pastor son and we was the perfect couple to everyone but my parents don't like that I was dating him at all and after our last break up my dad made a ""joke"" that I liked monkeys   and I was going to a high school that was mostly black kids so it was a very high chance that I would be dating someone who is black then at some point in the relationship I started reading sexual stories online and I didn't understand what I was feeling at this point and I ended up at 17 years old going to a bdsm website where I would talk to men sexually and send photos of me nude and I felt nothing from it I was happy in some parts but felt nothing most of the time.  

now I have issues with trusting people, I am scared of marriage and getting close to others and scared that someday when I have children of my own I will do the same thing my parents did to me. I know people will hate me because I cheated on my ex-boyfriend and i am so sorry that I did something so stupid in a somewhat good relationship.  and I am getting better now I trust my online friends and you guys more than I ever would with my family. I have a phrase that is stick in my head that shows my trust issues ""if you can't trust your family then who can you trust."" 

I don't know how to get over all of the things that happened to me in the past and I would like to know  how do I get over basically my whole childhood? how do I get over all of the fear in my own head? Why after all of this time still a part of me still wants to love my mother and father? they are only people but what they did to me can't ever go away.

70,throwaway8384648473,1613673497,"STRONG TRIGGER WARNING.

Hi everyone, I hope you‚Äôre fairing well. 

Let me get straight to the point.
My mother, an incredibly strong, intelligent, caring and beautiful woman, was beaten down physically and emotionally by her partner of the time, aka my biological father (wow I hate saying that). She left him when I was two months old, after staying with him 4ish years. 
He tried to destroy her, while beating her in every way possible, he tried to force her to take her own life (more than once). When she wouldn‚Äôt abide he would beat her. Her water broke while he was beating her, she was hiding behind a restaurant in the snow, made it to the hospital, gave birth to me alone. He cut the ties she had with her family. I could write a book on everything he did to my mum. She left him after he tried to suffocate me when I was two months old. She made it out.

She went back home, went back to school, met my (now) dad. Everything has worked out for my mum, and she deserves it. Trust and believe the demons still follow her, I hate him more than words can describe for that.

Now, I have my mum and I have my dad. My absolutely brilliant dad, who came into our lives when I was two months old. I have never missed out on having a father and I never will. My dad has been everything in changing our lives, I am so grateful for him it hurts. 

My sperm donor didn‚Äôt stop with his behavior after she left him. He stalked her, harassed her, berated her, hired investigators. 
He got bored eventually and got into a new relationship. He turned on her too, once they ended he did the same thing. He stalked her, he violated her privacy by sending private photos to her family, he tried to ruin her. Who knows what else he did that wasn‚Äôt written down. It was all available to read 10 years ago on the news, not a trace now. I‚Äôm sure he has the money to pay to have it removed again. 

He has a wife and two kids, I hope he treats them well, I truly hope he changed. He also has a business in currency manipulation, surprise surprise. 

Let me be clear. I don‚Äôt need anything from the guy, I made it clear after he was harassing me online that I had my own life and he is/will not a part of it (I was 13 when he started inappropriately messaging friends, school, trying to get a hold of me). I basically gave him the ok to not give a shit about my well-being. My message hit as he has not bothered me or my family since. I am so glad for it, but the anger is still there. 

The fact that everything he has done has been removed from public eye infuriates me. We should know who we are working with, who we are buying from. I want his investors, business partners, employees to understand who this person is, whether they decide to carry on working with him is their choice, but the information should be there. 

Like I said, I hope he has changed, but even if he has, it doesn‚Äôt change my intent. It still happened, he still hurt us. The scars are there. He wiped his own slate clean and forgave himself before any of us. He made it water under the bridge. 

When I expose him, I want to be precise. I don‚Äôt want it to come across as an emotional rant, but a simple statement of everything he has done. One of my problems is I don‚Äôt have the proof and I don‚Äôt know where the proof is (my mum never turned him in. I can‚Äôt remember the woman‚Äôs name from the news article and haven‚Äôt found the case since). I don‚Äôt know where to start. I want the truth to be out. It‚Äôs important, not just for me, but for our community and the next generation. They do not deserve to work under a man like this. He should not be a leader, boss, or father for the matter, until he has proven himself (and even then I wouldn‚Äôt go near him with a barge pole). He needs to own up to what he did and who he was, a lot of therapy, and honestly go through some shit (that he isn‚Äôt already dragging himself through) so that he can be humbled. Until then, he is an abusive manipulator through and through. 

Sorry for the rough read. Thank you for taking the time.

72,PoolOfAlpacas,1613661524,"I have been sexually abused throughout my life by my mother and her companions. I have memories of her finding out she couldnt get pregnant again, getting depressed, until she realized- she had a daughter with a working uterus. Why not just make her have the kid? So that's what her and her husband did. She became obsessed with my period and when I was going to start. When I finally did, she kept track of it. And when I hit my peak ovulation, I'd be drugged with either GHB or Ketamine and raped by her husband. 

My memories is super fuzzy, but I believe when my periods regulated at age 12 they succeeded in getting me pregnant and I gave birth. To a little girl I named Raven Lenore. I know Raven was real but I just... I'm not sure if it was me or the other girl in the room giving birth. I  remember the birth, I was there, I know one of us was the mother the other played midwife. I just cant clearly remember who I was in the situation. When I try to remember the pregnancy, my mind just hits a wall. I can tell there are memories there but they're just out of reach. Because I'm such a empath, either position would give me body memories of giving birth even if it wasnt me giving birth. But these body memories are just... so real. I'll wake up from a flashback about it and my body will literally be pushing. I can feel every gruesome detail of the birth in the memories. My body has stretch marks on it that indicate I grew out from my uterus. My stomach is full of stretch marks that are in a round pattern, the center point below my belly button. There are stretch marks on my thighs that pull up over my uterus. My hips have stretch marks indicating they spread out. And under my arms I dont have the stretch marks from gaining weight, only stretch marks fron my chest growing. I have pretty much constant pelvis and uterine pain like major damage has been done. And honestly? A 19 years old should bleed as much as I do. I shouldn't be on a 2 week on 2 week off schedule with unmanageable amounts of blood at 19 years old.

It might just be talking about what happened to me and what we're looking for to make another appointment for a scopy exam, but I think they're at least going to take a look to see if there are any questions they can answer today.

It is a struggle I have had most of my life and I have tried to fix through diet and exercise but nothing works. My mom is emotionally and when I was younger physically abusive and as a child I would eat to deal with the trauma. This has led to an eating disorder that triggers when I am around my mother so I am taking steps to distance myself from her. Yesterday when restrictions in my area were raised slightly she insisted I visit. I didn't want to but she kept on insisting and I eventually caved. We had lunch she lied to me about having cheese when I suggested we have cheese sandwiches with our tomato soup and when I saw the cheese im like oh we should put cheese in and she was like oh ok just a little and I said Oh sorry were you saving it for something I'm sorry I understand and she said no its to help you with portions. This would set the tone for the rest of the day where she continued to only talk to me about my eating habits and exercise. My sister let me stay in her room to avoid my mom until dinner. We were ordering Chinese food. My family was arguing, mom was saying that she didn't want to get to much chinese food because she didn't want anyone to feel tempted and I started to have a episode from overstimulation because of the screaming. My sisters dog who is a good boy saw this and put pressure on me to calm me down. I explained to my sister what a good boy he was and when she left my mom said ""I'm sorry I gave you a 'episode'(she finger quoted episode) but i was just making sure you weren't tempted."" I told her that I am very sad because everytime we have talked today it has either been about my weight or what i eat. That i have told her that i do not want to talk about these things and she is always disrespecting that. And then i went upstairs and I again ended up crying in the washroom. I went downstairs to leave and they tried to guilt trip me into staying and then when that didn't work drive me home. I was terrified of being alone it a car with my mom. I told mom that just because she hates her own body doesn't mean she's allowed to project that onto me. She got really angry after that. There was a lot of screaming and the entire family started fighting and I ran out the door to the side the the house and threw up and headed to a friends house.

This is my first reddit post so apologies if I have any of the posting norms incorrect. Also typing this on my phone, so sorry about formatting and all that. This will be a longish post. 

When I was somewhere between the ages of 7 and 9, my mom had a boyfriend who raped me (I'm a 19 year old man now). I have no idea how many times, it could have been once it could have been nightly. For a long time, I completely repressed the memory of the abuse. I only have vague flashes of two or three images burned into my brain and a feeling in my stomach that makes me want to throw up when I think about them. In the last two years or so, I began having dreams that I left me waking up both frozen and with all of my senses heightened, eyes darting around the room. What really opened my eyes was my wisdom teeth removal. When I came off of the anesthesia I was crying my eyes out with an all encompassing sense of dread and sadness. Slowly I put together the hints that I had been assaulted and by who, but I second guess myself every day. Having so little memory of any of the events makes me think that I could be implanting false memories or something, but whenever there are references to sexual assault or abuse in any kind of media, I get this distinct feeling of disgust and its the same feeling I get when I think about what few memories I have. 

My mom had a tendency to leave me on my own all the time for long stretches, even when she was there. She was a single mom who worked a lot so there was already relatively little contact between us, but she pretty much left me up to my own devices. She was always more occupied with her current boyfriend or a new obsession that she could funnel her money into. She just bought me whatever I needed to be entertained and left it at that. We never ate together, I cooked for myself since I could reach the stove. She spanked me well into childhood as well, and rarely believed me when I told her things that I had not done that she believed I had. I think all of these things combined may have been why I never told her at the time. 

From 8th grade onwards I fell into isolation. I didn't talk to anyone in the house and just watched YouTube or whatever endlessly until I had to go to school then repeated the process. I didn't sleep more than a few hours a night. I used to constantly have thoughts of hoping a random event would kill me so I wouldn't have to exist. I really didn't feel like I had any emotions at all, many times I still feel like I don't. I feel like I'm watching a first person video of myself sometimes, like I'm far away from my body. I used to cut myself for hours on the toilet for no reason I could discern. I still punch myself as hard as I can on the leg whenever I feel anxious or frustrated. I can't sleep many nights now either, only sleeping well if my antidepressants knock me out enough. The past few nights, I've felt like I'm constantly shaking and I lock doors and recheck them over and over. I feel like references to rape are everywhere and every time I see/hear something I fall into dissociative episodes or my anxiety spikes or I feel an overwhelming wave of sadness. After I feel triggered by something I feel like I think about it incessantly for days on end and it won't stop. I feel like I can't tell how much of my personality or existence has been shaped by this abuse (for instance, I'm bisexual but I have intrusive thoughts of feeling that my attraction to men stems from the abuse) I feel like I'm slipping and can't keep living like this. I'm going to therapy, but I don't know if it's helping enough. The only people I've ever told are my girlfriend of well over 3 years, who has been more than supportive, and my mom, who was largely dismissive and defensive. 

I guess long story short, I have no idea how to feel long-term contentedness or happiness. I feel like I'm making progress through therapy and reflection but then every reference to SA makes me feel like I lost that progress instantly, and I feel like every book I try or read or every show or movie I try to watch always has SA involved. Are there resources or books to read? Groups to join? Tricks you've learned to overcome these feelings? I just want to stop feeling empty and constantly unsafe, and to live a life that doesn't feel defined by my abusive experiences. 

Sorry this turned out so disjointed, unclear, and disorganized. It's really late/early and I'm kind of just venting. Also excuse spelling and grammar mistakes, I'm dyslexic. Any advice in the comment or PM would be greatly appreciated though.

a fresh mind that
doesn‚Äôt have room for a tragedy anymore. 
i‚Äôm not 16. 
and 
i‚Äôm so much bigger than the worst pair of hands to ever touch me, 
so much brighter. 
i‚Äôm phasing like the moon, 
and some nights my strength is only a sliver, 
but 
others my face is full, 
my eyes are wide, 
and my hands are asking for forgiveness. 
because i forgave you
and forgave you
and forgave you 
until i couldn‚Äôt think of you without thinking of forgiveness. 
but i forgot to forgive the girl who has been trapped in the backseat of that car for six years.
i knew the right words to say, so i left her in her grief alone, 
and forgot to remember how i walked home alone that night. how i held my own arms like they were my lifeline, 
how i grew and loved and breathed and climbed and  
survived, 
even after you killed part of me. 
it didn‚Äôt grow back how i wanted, 
but it grew bittersweetly, with a biting strength. 
i forgive myself for that night. 
i have a big grown-up job
and a big grown-up life. 
and i‚Äôm allowing the girl i left in that car to rest. 
she deserves it.‚Äù",survivorsofabuse,A poem about my abuse story,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/lmikcv/a_poem_about_my_abuse_story/,1613610675.0

One of the most harrowing memories that came back for me was not of myself, but of a girl that lived next door. I was about 4 I think and I was living in China at the time with my parents. There was a little girl who lived next door who was a similar age to me. I remember regularly hearing the screams and cries of that little girl as her family horrifically beat her. I can still hear some of it today.

My mother felt some pity for her, but my father said nothing. Both of them did nothing about it. They thought it was just normal and they shouldn't interfere. My father even tried to use it to teach me to be afraid of him, but I was too dumb to realise it at the time.

81,EndOfTheRopes,1613626390,"Hey

First off, I find it really difficult to call myself a survivor of abuse.. it makes me feel ashamed because there are people out there that have gone through way worse. anyway..

I don't want to rehearse everything that happened because I just feel too weak to do that but in short..

My ex isolated me from everyone, including family. She even got me to turn on my own sister.

She would constantly threaten to kill herself if I didn't do what she wanted, and if that didn't work she would threaten to sleep with her ex.

At this point I was still mad in love with her.

Then she started bragging about how much better her ex was in bed and in general.

She wanted to show me pictures of her and her ex having intercourse, I looked away and told her not to. I said it's not right and she said she was proud of those pictures.

Since then she would start to dig her nails deep in my skin, bite me, hit me and scratch me.

Everything I did was wrong, I was being punished for everything.

She made me worry, stress out and scare me often. After that she would lay me down in bed and be the big spoon, she would tease me untill my mind went numb and I started struggling.

She did this day in day out for almost a year, it made me go completely crazy.

Then one night.. I don't know what happened but I was sitting on the floor with my arm on a couch and I was crying really badly. My ex went into the bathroom and came out a little bit later, when she came out I was too afraid to look at her, so I kept my back towards her but I could feel, something was seriously wrong. I felt immense fear, as if something really really bad was going to happen.

She walked up to me and as she got closer the fear grew and my mind went blank with fear, she lifted me up from behind and I started struggling, I wanted to escape.

Then she laid me down in bed again and started teasing me again untill I felt safe again.

\^ this.. really fucked me up. 

Now a couple years later, I have uncovered that trauma and its worse than ever now. I feel as if im being constantly assaulted and yelled at but im all alone.

When I lay in bed I get this feeling she gave me whenever she laid me down in bed.

I just can't sleep because of this.

These things are starting to really weigh me down, my head gets heavy and my mind slowly goes numb untill im completely blanked out.

It is exhausting me so much..

I am reliving everything right now.. is this permanent???

I started to crave an abusive relationship, my mind starts imagining it, and the same thing happens, my mind goes numb.

I am trying to fight these cravings, but every attempt I make to shut it out I get immediately shut down.

Im afraid that this won't end and that I will end up in an abusive relationship.

Please tell me this is normal and im not going crazy.

I'm sorry if this doesn't belong in this subreddit, I really just need a safe place to let this all out..",survivorsofabuse,Am I going crazy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/lmetw2/am_i_going_crazy/,1613597590.0

 my relationship with my mother has never been good since my parents got divorced when I was 5. My dad had an affair, although he claims it was only a kiss, on my mom years prior to their divorce, as my dad begged for forgiveness and they moved past it. my grandpa, who was my dads father had a brain tumor, and passed away. the day after my dad found out, my dad caught my mother having an affair on my dads couch, which led to my mom wanting a divorce. 

 my mother went to a woman help shelter thingy(or whatever its called) to make my dad seem worse in the courts eyes. she moved in with the guy she was having an affair with. my dad also thought they could move past it and begged her multiple times to come back to him. 

 I was always a daddy's girl though. throughout all the confusion, I was still there for my dad. although we are not blood(i am adopted) I still see him as my father, no one else could replace him. 

 first, petty things happened when I was 6, but this was mostly my mom always siding with my siblings. my sister buried a pillow pet I got and refused to tell me where it was or dig it up for me, and my mo  did not punish her at all. my siblings often excluded me from them as well, I just kept to myself and watched tv. 

 as I grew up more, my mother would often treat me differently. she would let my siblings boss me around and treat me harshly. when they got a snack without asking, I would get one without asking as well, and my oldest sibling would rip it out of my hands or forcefully take it from me. if I asked for a snack instead of take, she would tell me no. so I snuck snacks instead and my siblings would always try to get me in trouble, which works.

 one christmas, my mom bought us all 3ds and each of our own games. we would all play games together sometimes, but soon they would exclude me from that too. my other older brother got bored with his game, and would take mine, and I would complain to my mother and she just told me to ""share"" and my brother abused that. he would always have my game.

 on the 3ds, you could send notes to each other, and I looked at my sisters things(I didnt know any better, I was young and curious, just little sister wanting to look at her big sisters things). I knew how to read. I found out all 3 of my siblings would constantly talk trash about me. they would call me a bitch, annoying, a lesbian, retarded, many things that hurt. I cried and told my mother, and my mother punished me instead, saying that I shouldnt have gone through her things. my siblings went unpunished.

 now here come the mentions of molestation.

 my oldest brother, brandon, was a really dysfunctional and abusive kid. he would smash a cup into my brothers privates when they were just toddlers, and grab my brother inappropriately. and my grandmother told me my other older brother, Joseph, who was 10 at the time, was stripped in bed by my brother brandon, who was 11, and was also naked, and got in bed with him. my dad didnt know about this until my grandma testified against the case in court where he was accused of being a pedophile and an abuser. he was verbally and sexually abusive. in all honestly I think was molested by my brother too, but I also dont remember being molested. i think i repressed it so badly that i just remember the feeling i have about it. i feel extremely uncomfortable when I'm left alone around older men. it's so bad that I feel uncomfortable around my father and my grandpa, or any older stranger. I dont know where this feeling sprouts from, but that is my theory. i think was taken advantage out by my other brother. 

 my sister claimed she was getting molested in the middle of the night when I was maybe 8 years old. my brother joseph said he was too. they all blamed it on me, which was an act i never committed, and, my mother believed them, and punished me. we started going to a counselor. just my sister and i. the counselor claimed I was molested by my dad( which never happened, and my dad thinks pedophiles should burn in hell and be sent to execution. my father would never). 

 i couldnt see my dad for an entire summer. he proved his innocence, but it still took a toll on me. it was hard. it felt like my dad was the only person who cared for me. 

 now here comes back the 3ds part. one day we were waiting in the parking lot for my dad to come pick us up from my mother. we were all on our 3ds' and my siblings were playing a game. I wanted to join so I asked, but they phrased very harshly about how I cant play with them. I was really sensitive, so I started crying really loudly, and my mom made me stand outside in the cold and I wanted her to let me in, and that's when my dad pulled in.

 my first words were ""get me away from this woman""(referring to my mother) as I cried and hugged my dad. of course my dad was concerned and was wanting to approach my mom. there was this old man eating and he walked up to my dad and said ""I'm calling the police"". to this day I dont understand why the police were called

 after the misunderstanding was solved, my sister, brother joseph and I went to my dads house. (my older brother brandon wanted nothing to do with my dad so he never went over to my dads house).

 when we came back, my mother had taken everything from my. my bed frame, my toys, my notebooks, everything. I had to write 100 sentences a day saying something like ""I will not get the cops called on my mother again"" and stuff like that. 

 my older brother Brandon had a dog named panther who peed and pooped all over my mattress. I smelled like pee all the time. my siblings treated me like a dog. they bossed me around and I had no free will. my sister would act like my mom. it was terrible. my dad and grandmother call it abuse. my mom made me feel worthless, and so did my siblings. 
 
 my brother brandon actually repeatedly slammed my head in the floor, I was crying and begged him to stop, and i begged my other siblings, who just laughed and watched, to help me causing my front tooth to chip and the nerve to die, and me to have to get a root canal. my mother lied to my dad and said that I fell off the trampoline instead of what actually happened

 because of this i would act out. tell my mom I hate her, told her I wish she was dead and I wanted to be with my dad. it was not a great relationship at all. 

 my mother soon decided I needed summer school even though my grades were adequate. I was in 3rd grade. she told me her reasoning was that she needed a ""break from me"". those words really affect me today too. I threw a huge fit and got in trouble. my mom sent me to bed without dinner and I chanted over and over to her that ""I hate her and I wished I could see my dad"" until I fell asleep

 the next day, she gave me the choice to live with my dad, I didn't understand at the time, but I stayed with my dad instead. I transferred schools, and was very isolated because my dad worked during the week. he had weekends off though. when my siblings came over, both of them had a phone, and it really upset me that my mom got them all phones after I left. I was 9 years at the time and was really jealous.

 as time went on, I still tried to visit my mom, but the gap was really big, and the favoritism was obvious. one Christmas she bought my siblings huuuuge stockings filled with many things, and I got a Mini one. 

 everytime I went to my mothers, I would just come back crying. my siblings trash talked my dad, and would address him by his  first name of ""Jack"". it upset me because I loved my dad, and then they would degrade me. especially brandon

 I was a chubby kid because I saw the way my dad ate a bunch and I wanted to eat just like him, causing me to gain a lot of weight. my brother always called me fat and ugly, and point out I'm adopted and rub it in my face. explain in detail how much he hates me. and I just told him I loved him and laughed at what he said because that's all I could do. I laughed and cried. I was helpless honestly. 

 even when I moved, I tried to be sweet. I went to one of my brothers football games with my dad because my sister was a cheerleader on the team, and I went to greet Brandonn and he told me ""you're not my sister"". those words hurt, and I cried to my dad again. I was young.

mentions of rape now

my sister now said that our cousin bailey raped her. when my father heard of this, he was livid, and he demanded custody of my sister. to him, he felt as his his daughter has been tossed around like a sex object. she was molested and raped, and he wanted to protect her. my sister was moved into our house as my dad faught for custody for her. 

 my sister and I shared a room because my brother joseph had his own when he came over during the weekend for my dad. she came clean about how she was afraid of brandon, and so she blamed being molested on me, and she wanted my forgiveness, and I agreed. 

 my dad lost custody of my sister, and she moved in with my mom, and from there my brother and sister hate him with a passion, mostly my sister. she texts him about what a terrible father he is for taking her away from my mom, and how she wishes that my dad would just let her step dad adopt her, and just tried to trash him every chance she got, and my mother encouraged it. 

 since then I havent talked to my mother until 2020. I needed to know why she treated me so differently, and why she did the things she did. she only gave me ""I have no idea what you're talking about, and I dont remember"" answers. it hurt that she lied like that. it hurt that she didnt take responsibility. I told her I think shes the reason why I have so many issues with the way I look, why I feel like I'm ugly and fat, and disgusting as a person. why I am not confident in who I am. and how she treated me was almost like abuse. she got upset and said ""so you're calling me abusive now?!"" and I apologized in fear. 

later, we, as in my dad, his wife, and me are moving to oklahoma. my dad wouldnt let me tell my mom that we are in fear that she would try to keep us here out of her spite and hatefulness for my dad. I wanted to see my mom one last time before we leave, because 

 soon, I find out my nana which is my mom's mom is passing away. I ask on messenger if I could attend the funeral and she leaves me on read. she didnt give me any answer. 

left on read for month an a half, I tell her happy Thanksgiving. she leaves me on read for 2 days and responds to me at 2am saying happy Thanksgiving back. then, on christmas I tell her merry christmas, she responds a day later. and seems really uninterested..

and finally, the first week of 2021 I initiate me seeing her. I tell her I want to see her, she says she'll see when shes free. I tell her ""okay mom. I turn 16(February 18th is when I turn 16) soon and I would really like to see you before then"" and she leaves me on read. a couple days later I message her instead asking her if shes looked over her schedule. she leaves me on read. I text her again telling her ""it's been too weeks"" and then  my sister texts me.

 I'm not on good terms with my sister. she publically humiliated me the year before in the mall. this is when we havent talked in years and so I just saw her, no feelings about her yet. I complimented her, saying she had the pretty genes, and I wished I was pretty like her. she said ""no no, you know who you look like? emily"". Emily is my birth mom. I have never met my birth mom or dad. i have no idea what they're like, or who they look like. and I felt humiliated. I felt like she was dangling the fact that I'm adopted make me a lesser person. and I went to court with my dad when him and my mother were there about child support. my dad lost but also won at the same time? I dont know how to explain it

 anyways after my sister text me, and asked me about how I felt about it. I didnt want to fight about it so I just said ""I have no opinion on it"" and then she went off on me. she told me I was just a child, and didnt understand anything at all. I just didnt text back. 

 back to my mom and my sister texting me. she told me my mom was in surgery and I wanted to know why, she didnt tell me and just went off on my again. she basically said I was stupid and I didnt get the hint. she told me my mother didn't want anything to do with me. 

and that stung. 

she blocked me
and then my mother blocked me. 

and I just feel like it's my fault
I feel so empty. I want to know why she hates me
why she rejects me..
I'm so disappointed. I know she wasnt the best mother, but I just crave a mom relationship so badly that I put myself in positions when I like I will get hurt. I wish she loved me the way I want her to. it hurts so badly. I can't sleep well anymore. I'm left with questions. 
""what did I do?""
""why do you hate me?""
""if I chose differently would we still be like this?""

I sleep around 5 or 6am because these thoughts bother me so much. I feel so miserable and all her words linger. I often find myself reading over our messages. I don't know what to do anymore..

86,20bc20,1613607138,"My granddad sexually abused me from as early as I can remember, I decided to go to the police the friday before last. (Around 4 years after I told someone for the first time - my cousin as I feared he may have done it to her too. Thankfully he hadn't.) 

It took a lot of therapy and time to get to this point, I'm really glad I finally did it. Part of what stopped me before was my brother's company carrying the family name, and it's a fairly unusual one, so people in the surrounding areas would know that this pedophile is a relative of mine if it were reported on. Despite me being the victim I still felt worried.

I spoke to my aunt (his daughter) and told her I had decided to go to the police. It turned out that he was already on bail.

My uncle (his son) had been caring for my nan, she has dementia and requires 24/7 care, but he had to leave the house for approximately 10 minutes. Leaving my nan alone with my granddad. 

When my uncle came back into the house he found my granddad had taken her into another room and taken off her trousers and underwear and was sexually assaulting her. Weirdly in the same room he typically assaulted me. 

My granddad was confronted by my furious uncle. My uncle got my nan dressed, out of the room and settled, and went back to shout at him. He then called my aunt and asked whether he should call the police, my aunt said yes and the police arrived and removed him from the house.

When he was questioned he admitted what he was doing and his intention to rape her. He thought this was fine as they're married. 

As well as this, the carer my nan has when my aunt and uncle aren't available told my aunt that he had tried groping her on several occasions too.

I've done my initial police reports and my recorded interview.

I really hope he is taken to court for these crimes, I also imagine there are many more instances of him sexually assaulting or raping other women.

The CPS is very backlogged at the minute though, so he may never face having to go to court because he's elderly and may not be considered a big risk and I find that hard to deal with. He may even die before anything progresses.

87,DaleCooper891,1613605334,"I posted this a few days ago in this subreddit, but as I‚Äôve reflected more, I wanted to add more details to my story. I appreciate any advice, and I apologize in advance for the long post.

The last few months have been weighing on my mind heavily. I feel so utterly depressed and overwhelmed to the point where I feel sick and nauseous like there‚Äôs a pit in my stomach. And my mental health has been so horrible. 

I met a guy a couple of years ago at a show and we exchanged messages on Instagram and agreed to meet in person.

During this time, I was feeling really depressed and apathetic. I felt like I had no one around me I could count on. I honestly didn‚Äôt really care what happened to me.

We walked around for a bit, hung out, and then sat down at a restaurant to get food. We talked a lot about movies, metal music, and video games. Afterward, it was getting dark and we continued walking outside and sat down on a bench. He actually laid me down on his lap and kissed me on my cheeks and lips and said that he didn‚Äôt want to lead me on, he thought I was cool, and that he just wanted to be friends. I was fine with that  as I was not romantically attracted to him and did not have feelings for him, but him showing me affection via a kiss sent me mixed messages.

We continued to hang out, exchange messages on Instagram, including, unfortunately, NSFW photos (which I regret so much), and we started a friends with benefits arrangement, and set a date where he would come over to my house. I was anxious that it might lead to something physical, and even though I agreed to a friends with benefits arrangement, I only had sex with one other guy at this point, and I felt so insecure and worried about impressing him, and I think he saw that. That night, we ended up lying in my bed and watching Youtube videos and concert films without doing anything. This whole friends with benefits arrangement was a wholly new experience for me and I felt so pressured to  live up to certain expectations.

After hanging out a few more times, we eventually became physically intimate and started to practice BDSM sex in our friends with benefits arrangement. The BDSM community is something that I have a lot of respect for, and when done in a safe, consensual manner, I think it can be a fun and liberating way to explore one‚Äôs sexuality. I am somewhat new to BDSM, and  tt first, I enjoyed our friendship and liked hanging out with him and the physical intimacy we shared together and at first,  I was a willing participant in the sexual activities associated with BDSM (a lot of graphic stuff I don‚Äôt really want to go into detail with). One time, during all of this, I met another guy that I was interested in dating, and told him if it becomes serious, I think it would be best to discontinue our FWB relationship and he was supportive and  said that he was happy for me and that I need something steady and that I deserve a main guy, and I even said that my FWB partner was an incredible person and if he ever wanted to hang out strictly as friends, I would be ok with that. Later on, the thing I had with the new guy didn‚Äôt work out, and I said I would be open to continuing our FWB thing, but only if he was comfortable and he said he kind of already switched me over to being a platonic friend, but then he expressed interest in continuing our  sexual activities so we did. Because, at this point, I still thought I could trust him as a sexual partner and I considered him a friend and ignored some of the now obvious red flags. I feel like this specific moment will act as a piece of evidence against me to question why I didn‚Äôt get out of this FWB relationship sooner or why I went back to him and continued things or even that I brought all of this mess upon myself. Worse or all, I feel like this will discount the following experience I‚Äôm about to go into detail with or will, in the eyes of people, prove I was not abused.

I was new to this subculture, and I think a part of that was because I felt like shit about myself, and had low self-esteem and confidence, rso why not degrade myself further? Looking back at it now though, I feel so utterly disgusted with myself and the things I said and did and acts I agreed to do and were willing to entertain . I feel like that version of myself is a stranger and reflects poorly on me now. While I was open to trying a lot of things and expressed as much, I also felt pressure to entertain some of these ideas because if I expressed hesitation, he would potentially call me a cunt or whore or not think I‚Äôm ‚Äúcool.‚Äù I felt like he subtly used my vulnerability (I told him numerous times that I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience and engaging in sexual activities like this felt weird to me) and my not being exposed to a lot of these activities to his advantage so he could get what he wanted. The constant need to please others (sexual partners and otherwise) and have people like me continues to be a struggle for me, and this specific relationship exacerbated it. feel like I left myself and the others who care for me down.


One night, a couple of months later, that changed for me.

I had on a leather outfit and I had a set up in one of the rooms of my house where we were going to engage in foreplay. It was harsher than normal, and while I understand that physical dominance can be an inherent part of BDSM and we used it in our activities, this affected me differently. As out foreplay went on, it got so bad I could barely stand up and I was in tears, but I felt I had to suck it up and go along with it even though I was uncomfortable because I thought he would shame me. It was past the point of pleasure for me.

We then moved to my bedroom. He got on top of me and was being incredibly rough, and kept slapping me as he went in and out of me, but it got to the point where it hurt me too much and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I was in tears and told him to stop, but he kept going without checking in or actually stopping. I just went completely numb and vacant and I felt like I just had to sit there and take it. Right afterward, I lied down on my side, just staring blankly into space, just trying to be ok. After that, I felt so disgusted at myself. I thought he would recognize something was wrong, especially since I told him to stop, but he didn‚Äôt. I feel like I‚Äôm a relationship like this, even with these power dynamics, the other person would check in (especially since given our discussions we did not remove the power to say ‚Äústop‚Äù as a means to end sessions and our relationship was not a strict TPE dynamic) see if I was ok or notice something but that did not happen. 

The worst thing about all of this is that I feel incredibly guilty and ashamed, like it was my fault my boundaries were being crossed and that I asked for it by being involved with him or that  I did something wrong and that by not speaking up more or establishing more clear boundaries and guidelines for actions and language for our sexual practices, like I brought this upon myself because I was naive and didn‚Äôt understand the rules or that it was bad communication on my part. Despite everything that happened, I still thought he was a friend to me, like something akin to a trauma bond, so we kept in contact. I was so desperate to have him like me as a person that I ignored all the warning signs. I still sought his validation and friendship repressed my own pain. From then on, my interest toward sex changed, and even though we continued sexual activity, I still felt like I had to play along with everything event hough I was hurt. I continued to talk with him and hang out with him: going  to coffee, dinner, talking about writing, and confiding in him about my guy problems. One time after the previously mentioned incident, I expressed a great deal of anxiety over a guy I had a crush on and had feelings for, and his first reaction was ‚ÄúDamn, if you weren‚Äôt so far, we could meet for car sex,‚Äù like that‚Äôs what I wanted to hear, and again, I plate dit off. Then he said, ‚ÄúWe should make a kink list and and we gotta do everything you want before you become respectable.‚Äù While this is seemingly nice on the surface,, I feel like if he took his position in our FWB relationship seriously, he would have pushed to do this earlier and showed me consideration and clear guidelines earlier on if that makes sense. I also find it interesting in hindsight that his first reaction to my guy problems was ‚ÄúOh, we should have sex‚Äù before I become ‚Äúrespectable,‚Äù implying that that I wasn‚Äôt. And again, I turned away from these warning signs and I feel so stupid for it. I think he was trying to be just nice enough to me that I would go along and not question anything.  I felt so pressured to play along and go with the flow because if I didn‚Äôt, he would call me names or stop being my friend, even if I was incredibly uncomfortable with his comments and the way he treated me. I felt like I had to make excuses for myself.

Beyond what I previously mentioned, he also called me a ‚Äúbitch, ‚Äúcunt‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhore‚Äù  on multiple occasions, both inside and outside the bedroom in person and in our Instagram messages and just made me continually feel like shit. Again, with BDSM, calling a submissive names like this can be common place and that was part of our relationship earlier on, but after the previous mentioned incident, I could not put up with being called that anymore and when I expressed discontent over these remarks, he said ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve always been about it; even when I call you that? Still going through guy problems?‚Äù And I replied by saying that ‚ÄúI already feel like shit about mysef and calling me a bitch, cunt, etc. makes me feel worse and makes me think of my past relationship and makes me not even want to fuck, and I‚Äôd rather not go through that.‚Äù Again, we were still friends and he acted like he cared, and I thought he would say something like hey ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I disrespected your boundaries and made you uncomfortable with my remarks‚Äù or be considerate and not come off as a jerk by saying ‚ÄúAhhh ok. I guess it‚Äôs time to ween you off of the degradation,‚Äù, which to me, implied that that was his whole aim during our entire friendship: degradation and not worrying about my pleasure or having any concern for me ( and he once said ‚ÄúThis is about degradation, not your pleasure,‚Äù). 

Then, when I tried to confide in him about a guy I had a crush on and the doubt I had, he said ‚ÄúAhh, so this means my ass won‚Äôt get eaten‚Äù and said I should change my view of myself from a cum dumpster/object and to not be easy, but then immediately after, said ‚ÄúThe way to your cum dumpster is through your mind.‚Äù Then when he made supposed acts of kindness and I balk at him being kind, he says ‚ÄúRight? You‚Äôve been not wanting to fuck lately and you eat my ass so it‚Äôs the least I could do.‚Äù Then, another time, he sent me a GIF depicting a sexual act, which I said I don‚Äôt want to do, and he said ‚ÄúWhy? I drop loads in your mouth all the time.‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt want to?,‚Äù‚Äôwith him replying in pissed off emojis.

One day, he messaged me out of nowhere and asked if I wanted to meet his girlfriend and I expressed hesitation and even said ‚ÄúGuess that means we won‚Äôt be hanging out anymore.‚Äù And then I felt so bad, I got the need to apologize and take back my words. I felt less offended by the fact that he had a girlfriend as I didn‚Äôt have romantic feelings for him; I felt more offended because I felt he disregarded my feelings and approached this in such a nonchalant manner. The whole interaction was really weird; I felt like they were just placating me and putting up appearances and pretending to take interest in what I was saying so they could keep up appearances and deluded me into thinking we were going to remain friends. After this, while we did not have sex anymore, we still shared a friendship, and talked to one another and hung out platonically, grabbing dinner and coffee, though less often than before.

Then, after a while, he blocked me on Instagram and I never heard from him again. Again, I think he realized that he got what he wanted out of me and when he found someone better, he was nice enough to me that I would go along and not question anything before he blocked me.  I think he saw me as disposable, something that could be thrown away and forgotten while he continued to live his life, not the supposed friends I thought we were. I never forgot though. 

Another sad thing about this is that while some of the messages I mentioned above that  we shared on Instagram showcase some of the problematic red flags, the majority of them also show the side of us where we had a friendship between us and that I was a willing participant in our earlier BDSM activities and agreed to take part or entertain certain thing and that showcase the times where he was being nice to me and listened to me and my problems. Moreover, they don‚Äôt show anything blatantly illegal or make reference to the incident as mentioned above and they don‚Äôt indicate the level of pure emotional pain and torment I was going through under the surface while trying to retain a semblance of sanity especially after he blocked off contact. 

Since many of the messages also conflict with what I was internally going through (they show us being friend versus showing the hurt I was going through), I feel like I can‚Äôt really prove anything with these messages and can‚Äôt use them as hard evidence, or they‚Äôll along with the NSFW photos will be used as evidence against me and ruin my life. (he blocked and deleted his Instagram and I believe married someone, so I doubt he would leak anything, but that is still a constant worry) I feel like my my words and experience won‚Äôt matter since it will be my word against his (especially the instance where I met that guy and it didn‚Äôt work out).  Because of that, and especially since BDSM and kink style sex was involved, and on earlier occasions, I was a willing participant and agreed to and showed openness to certain activities (some of which we did, some others we did not end up doing), and that people will label me a fake or a ‚Äúpsycho bitch‚Äù and that I know what I was getting into, or spreading  lies as a way to discount my pain and trauma and retaliate. So, I‚Äôm hesitant toward speaking out about this and naming him and reporting it since the messages TECHNICALLY indicate that he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. I‚Äôm really scared and ashamed of myself and what I was a part of. I feel like I let myself and others down. I wish I said or did something sooner and had more composure and courage back then to speak up more or leave the friendship.I was left with emotional and mental trauma: my paranoia, anxiety, and depression have gotten worse.

I want to talk to my Mom about this first and open up to her about it. I‚Äôve told my current boyfriend about the incident and some of the details, and he has been super supportive, but it has emotionally and mentally affected him so much and he wants me to name my abuser, but again, if I do that, I don‚Äôt really have anything to prove the abuse except for my word and I fear the abuser would retaliate, especially since he knows where I live. I obviously want and need to go to therapy and speak out (even if I don‚Äôt name him) for myself, but I‚Äôm thinking about my boyfriend too and I think he would be disappointed in me and he would continue to emotionally and mentally suffer if I didn‚Äôt name him, if that makes sense.",survivorsofabuse,Still dealing with fallout from FWB relationship.

I was just thinking about it though and was wondering it dawned on me his behaviour may have been grooming. He never sexually abused me but they got divorced so that probably aboided that possibility. I remember feeling creeped out by my dad from as far back as my memory goes.

They divorced when I was 7 so some of this happened at his apartment when I visited him alone after that time. I saw him not very frequently after the divorce.

Some of the thing he did up until I was probably about 10:

- left porn out in highly visible places
- made highly sexualized, inappropriate remarks frequently
- once tweaked my nipples and said I was ""growing little titties""
- made me shower with him (this was when I was old enough to shower by myself)
- stood over me naked staring at me while he thought I was sleeping

Is that a kind of grooming or just a super creep?

92,LadyoftheCakes,1613450328,"  

Since a young age, I have been very good at suppressing my emotions. I learned quickly that the world did not give a damn how I, a poor black girl, felt. I was raised to be the keeper of family secrets and the guardian of familial pain, and yet I could not react to it. Emotional reactions in my parent‚Äôs house elicited one of two responses, the belt or the scream; there was no in-between. I can still remember my father‚Äôs reaction to my 8-year-old self- crying and begging my mother for a plum because I was hungry. My father upset that I had the gall to not accept my mother‚Äôs answer of ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù decided that the best course of action would be to take a belt to his child for having the audacity to be hungry. The shouts of ‚Äústop crying, or I‚Äôll give you something to cry for,‚Äù still find their way into my mind all these years later, when I feel like crying, but the tears will not come. 

I learned to hide my feelings, and knew that even when asked directly if something was wrong, the answer always no, lest someone find out that the house you live in has not electricity or indoor plumbing, or that the new boyfriend your mother moved in after your parent‚Äôs divorce touches you at night while your mom‚Äôs at work, or even that your oldest brother kisses you on the mouth and asks to show you where your ‚Äúhappy spot is.‚Äù In my family, all of these things were considered no one‚Äôs business outside of the family. So, I knew that these were secrets that I must keep and therefore, the emotions attached to must be remain unacknowledged. 

I am also the collector of sorrows and forbidden knowledge. I learned from an early age about sex and kissing and touching, things no child should have to learn. I learned that my prime age of physical attractiveness for adult men was between the ages of 9 and 15. After that, I became invisible, and even repulsive, to the opposite sex. My formative years were spent fending of the advances of grown ass men, while also not letting on to the turmoil this was creating internally. Something I just could not understand for the longest time was why men found me unattractive, now? Why now, when I was old enough and ‚Äúready‚Äù for male attention, do they shrink away from me? Call me ugly? Get insulted by even the slightest notion that I may like them? 

This is a mess I am still trying to clean up in my mind, all these years later. As I went through my teenage years, it became a game for the boys to take turns asking me out as some sort of joke, which I still to this day do not get. As I entered adulthood, the game changed. Men still found me repulsive, but I was the most attractive girl in the world, if they thought I would sleep with them; and I did because I needed the validation, I needed to know that someone found me attractive if even for a minute, I needed to know if I was a virgin because I could not remember what happened that one night when I was ten. 

The funny thing about sleeping with men who do not find you attractive is that they can usually be broken down into three types: The ones that will fuck you, and then are embarrassed that they fucked you, the ones who will fuck you so they can go off and laugh about it with their friends, and the ones who want to fuck a black girl (or insert whatever other ethnic/racial group), and literally any one will do. I, of course, am not supposed to have any feelings about this. I get labeled a crazy, clingy bitch if I expect any modicum respect after a sexual liaison. There are rules to be followed if guys only want you for sex but are otherwise unattracted to you.

1. If you text or call them they can ignore you, and you can‚Äôt be upset about it because that makes you clingy, but if a guy texts you for nudes, sexting, or actual sex, if you ignore that message, you‚Äôre an ugly bitch and they will no longer talk to you‚Ä¶until the next time they want to have sex.

2. You are not allowed to call yourself their girlfriend, friend, or FWB. You are literally just some girl they know to all their friends and family.

3. They are not taking you on a date before trying to get into your pants; and if they do, you are paying for all of it, even the gas.

4. When you have sex, your pleasure be damned.

Number four is especially important due to several factors. These are the men who expect you to pleasure them in any way they deem necessary (and I do mean doing all the weird, freaky, and kinky shit that is not plausible outside of a porno), but they will not ever even try to make you orgasm. Foreplay, if it happens at all lasts for two second, and if you didn‚Äôt get off, well that‚Äôs your fault. They allow you no time to adjust to their size or girth before they just start plowing away; even though you are not lubricated enough, even though they are hurting you, even if you ask them to stop‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt even enjoy sex, it feels like nothing to me, and yet I keep having it, with men who treat me like I‚Äôm nothing because I need to feel like someone wants me even for a moment so I‚Äôm not so goddamned alone. 

The crazy thing is, it is not even like I actively seek these men out. Whenever I try looking for someone, trying to make a connection, I always come up empty handed. I am just not the type of women decent men want to be with. So, I take what I can get because even the scraps of someone‚Äôs affections is better then being alone.",survivorsofabuse,"Just Needed to Get This Off Of Chest, Today I'm Really Struggling to Understand My Existence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/lkvz46/just_needed_to_get_this_off_of_chest_today_im/,1613421528.0

hi everyone. this is kinda difficult to write. for many reasons. i don‚Äôt want this to be super professional &amp; i‚Äôm not gonna go back &amp; make sure my spelling is perfect or my grammar is perfect. i just want this to be natural &amp; free flowing. i just need to get this out. this is probably gonna be long &amp; all over the place, so if that‚Äôs not your cup of tea, i just understand. i just need some help. 

i fear that i was sexually assaulted as a child. i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right phrase to use. but if fear that i was touched or forced to do something sexual or something similar to that nature as a child. i guess i‚Äôll explain why i think this &amp; give some backstory. 

i have a VERY intense fear of men. now to be fair, i do have severe anxiety &amp; paranoia. so this could be an explanation‚Ä¶ but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. walking on the same side of the street as a man is scary for me. sitting near men on public transport is terrifying for me. i would rather walk wherever  i‚Äôm going. i‚Äôve gotten off buses before because the only spots to sit or stand were near men. i will wait in long lines at stores to get a female cashier. i‚Äôve left stores before because i got to the checkout line, only to find all male cashiers. at school, i will not talk to my male teachers/staff members. if i don‚Äôt have a choice, i have panic attacks &amp;/or shake/cry the whole time i talk to them. i‚Äôve had a rocky relationship with my father for almost my whole life. as a young kid, we had a close bond. but as i got older (10 years old?), our relationship really crumbled. there are many reasons but some include; his pretty bad anger issues (which could also explain why i‚Äôm scared of men), the divorce between my parents, me living with my mother after/during the divorce, my fear of/anxiety around men, etc. it‚Äôs very hard for me to determine if certain thoughts i have about him are connected to possible abuse or just my paranoia/anxiety. for example, i missed my period for a year &amp; i was terrified that i was pregnant. that logic didn‚Äôt make sense because i never had sex before. i remembered that i had slept over at my dad‚Äôs house one night. for a good nine months, i worried about my father raping me in my sleep &amp; that i was pregnant. see, this could just be paranoia. but is it just paranoia? 

i am a very sexual person. i‚Äôve always been a fairly sexual person, even as a child. i believe i started watching porn/kissing videos/adult content at 6. i watched a lot of adult content. occasionally, i would explore my private areas while watching these things. i didn‚Äôt start masturbating until‚Ä¶ 11? 12? it‚Äôs hard to remember. but regardless, i‚Äôm a very sexual person. once i graduate, i plan on being a stripper &amp;/or sex worker to make income. i‚Äôve always wanted to fulfill people‚Äôs fantasies &amp; please people sexually. i want to help people act out their biggest fantasies &amp; desires. now this is the part i‚Äôm super embarrassed &amp; horrified about. i have some intersect in cnc. i‚Äôll make it very clear‚Ä¶ i am 1000% against being raped. but i am interested in consensual non consensual sex. i‚Äôm very ashamed of it because i would never ever want to belittle sexual assault/rape survivors. i‚Äôm very fearful of being legitimately raped. i consider myself a very ‚Äúeasy‚Äù person. i will sleep with almost anyone. i like being degraded &amp; told what to do &amp; i‚Äôll do just about anything. if i‚Äôm out at a bar &amp; a guy asks to see my tits, i‚Äôd flash him. again, i want to make it super clear, i am 10000% against legitimate rape. i only mention these fantasies &amp; sexual interests because i think they are relevant. i totally understand if people think it‚Äôs disrespectful &amp; wrong. trust me, i know. 

(i‚Äôll just fire through some things that i think are note worthy) i do have a condition that impacts my memory. it‚Äôs called aphantasia. it‚Äôs the inability to visualize things within the mind. it can impact your memory &amp; it definitely impacts mine. now here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ aphantasia can be developed after trauma. it‚Äôs definitely possible that i was able to see things in my mind as a child. sometimes it feels like i can almost picture things from my childhood. but that might not mean anything. but my memory is absolute rubbish. like garbage. so it makes it insanely difficult to even try to think about my childhood. like i said before, i have severe anxiety &amp; paranoia. this could be related to trauma. i have severe trust issues. like severe trust issues. even with family. i have an insanely hard time saying no to people. like a super hard time. if someone offered me heroin, i‚Äôd feel bad/awkward saying no. i‚Äôm very anti-relationship. i don‚Äôt believe in love &amp; relationships. i don‚Äôt believe in loving someone for forever. i go have some anger issues as well. i am pansexual. it took me quite a while to figure it out. for context, i‚Äôm female. i feel much more comfortable around females. i often doubt my sexuality tho. i feel like my fear of men made me pansexual. but that might just normal ‚Äústruggling with your sexuality‚Äù things. i‚Äôve always had a ‚Äúdirty mind‚Äù even as a child. i have a fear of germs but this has only developed over the past year (not related to covid.) i read this article on warning signs that you‚Äôve been sexually abused as a child. one section asked; ‚Äúdo you suffer from any of the following? 
- depression
- anxiety and social anxiety
- sleep disorders
- eating disorders
- self-harm
- suicidal thinking
- low self-esteem
- identity crisis
- addictions
- sexual problems
- panic attacks
- OCD around cleanliness or self-care
i suffer from every one of these. several social workers &amp; therapists said it‚Äôs possible that i also   
have bipolar &amp; paranoid personality disorder. 

anyway, i‚Äôll probably wrap this up now. i‚Äôm immensely sorry if this offended or triggered anyone. i deeply apologize. i just need some help. i‚Äôve debated posting this for so long &amp; i just need some help. it‚Äôs eating me alive. there are many others things that i could mention in here, like my dad ‚Äúpressuring‚Äù my mum into having kids or my dad‚Äôs severe anger issues. but i think i‚Äôll leave it here. please be open &amp; honest. i‚Äôm still very hesitant to even entertain the idea of sexual abuse. i don‚Äôt want to make something out of nothing. i take sexual assault &amp; sexual abuse so seriously &amp; i would never want to make myself a victim. even my own mother &amp; aunt have started to wonder if something happened to me as a kid. it‚Äôs scary to me. but honestly‚Ä¶ it would explain a lot. again, i am so insanely sorry if this comes off as offensive. i don‚Äôt mean any harm. i know you can‚Äôt speak on behalf of every sexual assault survivor. but i‚Äôd appreciate the input. also, i know you obviously can‚Äôt determine if i was sexually abused as a child just by reading this post. like i said, there‚Äôs tons more that i could get into. 

thank you. i‚Äôm sending loads of love &amp; positivity to you all. again, i‚Äôm so sorry if this is problematic. üåªüñ§

I am currently 24 years old but I believe this happened between the ages of 8-10. Something must have reminded me of this and now I can't stop thinking about it in my head. 

When I was younger I went to my best friend's house often to play. We were both girls around the same age, and she loved to play games. Especially games she would make up herself. But sometimes we would be in her room, and she would want to play truth or dare. This happened a couple times, where it ended up with her daring me to do something like take off my clothes, do something naked (like 10 jumping jacks), and eventually manipulated me into having to lick her prepubescent chest, butt, or vulva. I refused but she would either lock the door or threaten me with something embarrassing or bad (and now I can't really remember what). So I have this disgusting memory of her standing there waiting for me to lick her X amount of times for the dare. I just remember how disgusting it tasted at that time. There was also times I had to go pee, and she came and made me let her watch. I begged her not to but she would be manipulative to make me feel like I had no choice. There were other times when she brought me to her younger brother's room and made us all take our clothes off and do similar things (nothing sexual with her brother but still seeing eachother do dares). I don't know why I kept going to her house to ""play"" but at the time I guess I didn't know any better. 

I remember her mom came knocking on the bedroom door once when we were undressed and her mom looked suspicious when we got dressed and finally opened the door, but it makes me wonder if her mom knew anything? Maybe this girl was abused by a family member and that's why she wanted to do these ""games""? This happened once in a while over at least a year span. 

I just thought about these memories more recently and I can't believe I was ignoring it. I always thought it was my fault I would do these things with her, when really she was always the one pushing me to do these things and putting me in an awkward place. Is this technically child-on-child abuse? I can't tell who would be the one responsible for this. Is it her fault? Her parents fault for not watching us? My fault for not telling my parents or taking whatever consequences she threatened me with to get out of it?

97,One-Win-7694,1613438674,"Hey everyone, this is a sensitive and dark topic, per childhood sexual abuse, but my fiancee could use some help: ideas, experiences, book recommendations, support groups?

Background: my fiancee have always had issues with sex. I was a virgin and recovering ex-mormon when I met her. She was sexually experienced but had struggled through; sex was always a toxic aspect of her relationships. She was molested repeatedly by her stepdad when she was a kid and it has stayed with her.

We get together in that context and started our romantic and sexual relationship. During sex I'd sometimes notice her losing enthusiasm but she wouldn't say anything to end the sexual encounter, I would pause and check in and she'd   say she lost all pleasure and interest in having sex. I knew, and she'd say, that it was in connection to her childhood abuse. We'd go through phases of little sex and ones of moderate sex. I think I've done a pretty good job of being emotionally supportive; she's said as much.

Last night she disclosed to me that when we're having sex she often has to imagine being raped or molested to enjoy herself. She ends up going into shame or being triggered and she can't continue any more.

This is so heartbreaking to me. I love her a whole lot and sex is part of that expression. **We talked though her options: not having sex any more, dealing with the triggers like we have, leaning into the darker parts of her sexuality, or ""curing"" her trauma.**

She didn't want to stop having sex, she expressed doubt about being cured, was terrified of the idea of leaning into the darkness, which left maintaining the status quo which neither of us are happy about.

The conversation had to end as it was getting emotionally exhausting. She tasked me with fact finding. This is where I need help:

Are there options available outside of the four I highlighted? Does anyone have experiences or resources to share in regards to one or more of those options? We are aware of therapy as a direction we can go, but it'll be at least a year before that is logistically possible.

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home--no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to start with this but here goes, this is really hard for me to write so please be gentle if I don't belong here. 

Last summer I more or less had a breakdown where I realised I couldn't continue living the way I was. I started trying to get help soon after. Due to NHS waitlist I only just started receiving some, and its made me question what really happened. 

Along the way some of the helplines I have called in some of my darker moments have referred to me as a ""survivor"". I don't feel like one, nor do I feel I deserve to be called it, I've read some of this Reddits more recent posts. You guys truly deserve that title, I curled up inside myself and hid. 

I suppose I should explain what happened. My father has a temper and is a bit of a narcissist (I think, from what I've read it fits but can't claim its true) as such he would flip off the handle at the slightest thing. punishments were always physical and always left a red mark (although never a bruise), he would be screaming at me and red in the face. He rarely if ever made me feel like I was good enough for him. I think I could have taken the hits, if he was calm, but when he was screaming I was terrified. My mother tried protecting my siblings and me but couldn't stop all of it. she left him when I was 11, after that I had to step up, I tried to keep an eye out for my younger sibling (do some of his cores when he did them wrong, to save his punishment) I even told him I would take the punishments as my own to protect him ( I wasn't very successful, he still got punished and I did to for lying and crying when he shouted).

To this day I am still scared my father will shout at me, and that has bled into all male authority figures, I'm in my early 20's now and logically could defend myself if need be.

103,brokenpa,1613399531,"I grew up with an older brother. He was very aggressive towards me and my parents allowed this to the point of gaslighting me (He isn't hurting you, you're fine) and it escalated into sexual abuse.

By the time I was in high school, the abuse was so bad I was suicidal and my mother just did not want to deal with it. She would scream at me for asking for help. She called me names when I asked to see a therapist and I ended up running away from home at age 16 to try to escape my family.

My brother would physically harm me to the point of me screaming. Then, we would both get hit/beat by mom and dad for bothering them.

105,AnaLikesAppleJuice,1613378672,"A morbid question, I know. I won't go too much into detail here, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. I'm new here and all.

When I was 7, my 16/17 year old cousin abused me. I wasn't sure what was going on. My school was pretty conservative + Christian and didn't teach sex ed until around 11 years old. I can't help but feel if I'd had the knowledge this wouldn't have happened, but that's besides the point. She told me that we'd both be in a lot of trouble if anyone found out, and I believed her like an idiot. I told my other cousins at a later date. One of which I learned used to abuse the cousin who abused me. I really don't remember how or why I told them, but they kept it quiet.

I have little memory of how I felt afterwards. Confused? I don't know. But I remember that this age is when a lot of my mental health problems ramped up. I don't feel like I really had a childhood because well, I was never really allowed to have that carefree mindset. This abuse wasn't the only problem I was dealing with too early, but I didn't even know it was abuse at the time. It was just... that happened?

As I got older I'd told myself I could have stopped her if I wanted to. I could have just said no, stop this is weird. I've struggled with hypersexuality since that point. It was like a switch was flicked. Every time sex was mentioned anywhere I'd dive deep into finding out more or seeing it. It was like another side of the world I'd missed, and it was a rush. It's really embarrassing and horrible to admit, but it's me I guess. 

However, if I'd ever see something sexual when I really didn't want to, like a random sex scene in a movie I was trying to enjoy, I'd get upset and disgusted. If people kissed on TV I'd get really uneasy if I was around someone else. If it was more than that I'd leave or something. 

I went through 11-17ish still not even thinking about it, but just sort of being acutely aware of it. It was around 17 that I started looking for counselling and stuff. It was when I started talking about it and eventually seeing specialist people for it that I realised how much this contributed to so many of my struggles. I do feel robbed. Like in a cosmic sort of way. Does that make sense?

When I hit adulthood things went downhill fast. I still feel like a kid trapped in this adult body. I don't feel ready or strong enough, I still feel like I need that protection and support. As an adult though, my family just took my problems less seriously until it came to self harm. 

I told my mother all about it when I was 19. It was scary because I've been raised to put my problems last, and I know my mom is mentally unwell. I didn't want her to freak out. When I told her she just went stiff. She hugged me, and it was one of the few hugs I've had in the past few years that actually felt like something.

But then everything got out. I told my mom my cousins knew already, and she called them. They said they didn't know what to do when I told them and didn't want to split the family, so they kept it to themselves. A few days later, one of them had told their mom, the mom of my abuser. 

The phone call that followed between her and my mom was absolutely harrowing. She was calling me a liar and a pervert, jealous, psycho, whatever you could say to someone coming forward about abuse. I felt dehumanised. I felt 7 again. I just sat, curled up against the kitchen sink, shivering and sobbing. I had to hold my hands to my ears to block my once loving aunt out. I felt like someone had snapped my brain in half. Every memory with her feels like a lie. A huge chunk of my family thinks I'm the worst scum. They were supposed to protect me.

I knew people would be like this. That's the saddest part. But in a way, I was a little prepared. 

But I wasn't prepared for my cousin's reaction.
She knows she did it. I told 2 people over 10 years ago about it. My mom knows I'm telling the truth, and so do my mental health coordinators. And yet she still denied it all. She used her own guilt and fear as a weapon, and it was apparently all my fault according to that half of my family. Yes, I imagine she'd be having a much easier time if she'd not abused me in the first place. But sure, my fault. My fault that she can't eat or sleep because of what she did, and my fault she wants to die.

I can't even begin to express how disturbing this feels. I know some of you here will unfortunately know what I mean. Being abused and carrying it, and then being kicked while you're down by people you thought would love and protect you unconditionally. 

She seems to have gotten a lot of support by pretending she wants the police involved. Smooth move. The police can't do anything now, right? And even if they did, she has a baby now. I don't know what to do about that. I don't want her baby to go through the system or anything. 

But on my down days I always think how unfair this all is. She gets a great job, her little family, lovely house, fancy car and whatever. I'm stuck thinking about what she did, or whatever other shit I have going on. Constantly screwing up because I'm scared to wake up in the morning. Missing deadlines. Worsening grades. No sleep. Honest to god wanting something to just come and sweep me off this Earth. Like, the opposite of success.

I'm just coasting and I just don't feel like I belong here. I feel like I'm doomed to eternal fuck ups because at my core I'm damaged and my brain has worked around it or built on it. It all makes more sense since discussing the event in therapy, but it doesn't stop the longing for a safe, happy childhood, or the unshakable feeling of injustice I live with, the theft of my soul, and the resulting husk.

I have to live with this every day, and she probably forgot about it and moved on. She found a life that seems so out of reach for me. It feels so unfair. Life was so different before it happened. It wasn't perfect but I had dignity, drive and confidence. I could shrug off most of the BS. Since then everything has felt crushing.

And on those down days, I find myself wishing for her to die. It's stupid and immature and gross, but it feels very real. Like, maybe if she had a car crash or something? You'll probably judge me but I have to be honest. 

 Every time my mind goes there I feel a pit in my stomach. Am I insane or something? I feel like a disgusting person. I would never lay a finger on her of course, and I wouldn't even report it in case it compromised her baby's childhood. I wanna make that clear at least. But the feeling of justice it gives me is sometimes a genuine source of inspiration. I just feel like I need to redirect that source to something else.

In general I'm against the death penalty, and more in favour of treatment for sex offenders, but absolutely prefer predatory and dangerous recidivists to be locked up. I also think mob justice is juvenile and honestly quite scary. This makes me feel like I've selfishly betrayed my own principles. I feel really dumb for finding any satisfaction from these ugly thoughts. I know no good would come from even prison for her. I'm so scared of being a hypocrite, ranting about my childhood being taken and then subjecting her child to the system. And yet, I just keep returning to this fantasy every time it gets to me. I feel like I'm becoming a bad person. Everyone has their reasons for becoming twisted, and maybe this is mine. It feels like I've grown up to become someone I didn't want to be. 

Has anyone else felt like this? Am I overreacting? I can't see my therapist right now, and I don't want to bother my friends with it, so I figured I'd find some help or something here.

106,starrynights1884,1613359448,"Hi! I wanted to share a lesson I learned. I know a lot of times people do want an apology from the person who ab\*sed them, and I was one of those people in past situations. I think it depends on person to person. What I've come to feel is, if I wanted an honest, good apology- I would want it from someone who wasn't capable of abusing me. Do I think people can grow? Sure. But it's not my responsibility to sit around and wait for them too, hoping I get a lackluster apology at best, or a passive agressive hurtful one at worse. It's not yours either. 

I remember someone getting annoyed with me when I was offered an apology by my ea personally. I told them ""no, they aren't capable of it, it would only hurt me more."" and they annoyedly responded about how I hadn't communicated (which i had; but that's a story for another day.) To end this post

i still don't want an apology, even by the people who tried to humiliate me publicly. Am I mad it happened? Yeah sometimes. But sometimes people just aren't capable of good things, that's not how their wired. Should they be held accountable? Yeah in a just world, but it's not my responsibility anymore, and I'm tired of acting like it should be. 

Anyway, this lesson has really helped me even with stuff before all this, and i thought it might help someone else &lt;3 I hope it helps you- and if you want an apology you are so valid! it can be really healing for many people.

Just venting I guess.

The prosecutor got my case in October and no decision has been made yet. I'm worried they will decide not to charge him. The prosecutor's advocate (?)

I checked in again around the end of December and they told me that time that they will contact me when they hear something but now I'm contemplating contacting her again. I'd probably be bothering her though. . .

I want to file a title IX lawsuit but I feel that if the guy doesn't get charged then that lowers my chances of anyone taking that case. I thought it'd be quick because the guy basically admitted he did it in texts they have but idk. I can't really do anything about anything right now.

She has a close friend from childhood and he would stayed in our house to look after me while she at work.  He was a cool guy and we got along great. He helped with household chores, groceries, laundry and even helped with homework. One day, everything changed.  I was taking a shower when he came in only in his underwear. He got in shower with me and started to touch me.  I was shocked/surprised but didn‚Äôt resist.  He led me into our guest bedroom where things got very sexual. I remembered  It continued through  the duration of night. 

I really haven‚Äôt talk about my experience.  If anyone has any thoughts, questions, advice they be willing to share are welcome.

No judgement.

113,renaissancerebel20,1613252469,"Something my brother did today just absolutely triggered me. Growing up, I was a ""target child"" because of my dad's overt sexism. This meant that dad would recruit my brother (my only sibling) to bully me, convincing him that I deserved it for various reasons. Bullying my mother and I (and sometimes worse) was basically how the two of them bonded. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Both of us are adults, though I live with my parents and go to school for financial reasons. I texted my brother because the last time the whole family visited him, I accidentally left my only jacket in his guest closet. Obviously with this major cold snap hitting a lot of the country, I'm going to need it. I asked if he could send it to me, explaining that I would really need it. He didn't text me back, but later texted *my parents* saying that I *instructed him* (implying that I was being bossy) to send my jacket to me, and said, ""Ground, *I guess*?"" (shipping) expecting them to commiserate with him about how awful I am. My father responded by apologizing that he had to deal with me. My brother said shipping cost $12 and asked to be paid back. My father agreed.   


This fucker *in his thirties* who is *loaded* (drives a new Lexus and owns his own place filled with expensive electronics that he routinely shows off to me) is bitching about sending me *my only jacket* during one of the worst cold snaps the midwest/South has seen in a while, on one of his days off. And then he doesn't text \*me\* to tell me he sent the jacket, he texts my parents, including another former abuser, to bitch about how imposing I am.

115,Mysterious-Tomato590,1613245620,"I'm looking to get recommendations on how to best document what my 29 male Husband is doing to me 26 female. I was thinking about getting a camera like a security one that would upload to my cloud. I don't want him to know about it so it would have to be small. But I have no idea how to do this. He hasn't ever hit me but is extremely emotionally abusive. He's been getting more and more unstable recently and I've been working on getting myself to a point that I can leave. But I want evidence of his blowups. I tend to shut down or go into a panic attack when he starts to get upset. Because of this, I've never been able to turn on my camera or anything. His blowups have also been getting worse and worse over the last year. I've stopped buying glass dishes as he just breaks them and then I spend the next 2 hours trying to clean glass up. When I locked myself in our room to try and get some space during an episode he splintered the wood around the lock while banging on the door. But the worst he's done so far was point his gun at me and just stared at me for what felt like forever but was probably only a couple of minutes. I want this documented!!!

I want to be able to show his parents my side of this when shit hits the fan as he's originally from China and his parent don't speak English well. I want them to know so they can get him help. I also want the documentation for my own peace of mind.

Any recommendations you have on how I can best document what he's doing to protect myself in the future would be helpful. I'd also love to know more about the process of leaving and resource you might recommend. I am just starting to be able to even think about leaving without it sending me into a panic attack, so please please please be gentle. I know I need to leave and I'm trying to. I'm just not ready or able to yet.",survivorsofabuse,I want evidence!
