I was so nervous prior, I haven’t really done this kind of thing before. I was also nervous and awkward with kissing him in front of a camera but my fiancé was so sweet and adorable during, talking to me and saying sweet things. I felt so loved and felt entwined with him and looking into his eyes. I can tell he was nervous too and that helped me feel less alone with the feeling. I was so proud of myself for going through with it. And I’d like to do it again because it ended up being a lot of fun as well as getting me out of my comfort zone. I have avoided planning a wedding because the whole process makes me want to throw up, it doesn’t sound like fun to me. Being the center of attention and having a crowd of people you know watching you and expecting things. We are planning on a small wedding, possibly in city hall or our backyard esp because of covid and also I just want to get the thing done and I’m scared of ppl lol.

7,Time-Bodybuilder-553,1614190982,"After Chritmas, I accidentally did something that angered my supervisor at work. For most of the month of January and part of February, my supervisor was very mean to me at least 2-3 times per week. Stuff like sending me nasty emails, picking at my work, attacking my work ethic. It was horrible on my anxiety. I cried from the time I got home, and then couldn't sleep at night. I thought about quitting my job. I got depressed. I didn't think it would ever stop, and I need this job. The straw that broke the camel's back was a mean email she sent saying that my work looked ""amateur"" and that ""competitors were enjoying these errors."" She was very condescending in the email, and totally wrong about what she was complaining about. So, I decided that I had to stand up for myself. I had her come in to my office (my territory) and told her that she was wrong, that I had no way of knowing that she wanted the project done a certain way because she never communicated that, and that I had done my research before completing it. The whole time I forced myself to look her in the eye, raise my voice to a dominant level, and keep my posture upright. She backed down almost immediately. As of today it will have been 14 days (work days) since she has been rude to me. She has actually been noticeably nicer. I didn't even have to give her the whole ""do not speak to me that way"" line like I had been practicing. Quite frankly, I am bamboozled that this worked. I thought I would have to do this multiple times. But no. This has been such a huge improvement in my life and my anxiety has been much better (even better than it was before she started acting out). I think it's because my anxiety isn't always telling me that I'm weak anymore and making me terrified of standing up for myself. I did it and it worked.

14,maplehus,1614189167,"Let me start of by saying that lurking through this sub for the past two months has been great for me! This is my first post and I know I will struggle to make it short but here it goes.

I (35M) have always had the tendency to worry (future, death, death of loved ones, my two kids and what would they do and more importantly feel if they lose me or my wife). So nothing too healthy, but the thoughts were never debilitating in any way or form, annoying for sure, but I could always function normally family, socially, and career-wise (high stress jobs - as I am finishing my PHD and work as a freelance consultant). During the day, I can always move past these thoughts.

**1- Christmas Break**

My wife and kids had to travel across the world to our country of origin for a planned 3-4 weeks (where most of my family and hers live) due to a family emergency on her end. I had to stay put at home for work-at-home. At that time we were and still are in a state of strict lockdown but I figured I will get some work one. Usually, I enjoy some solitude every now and then but since COVID, the most they have been away is a week within country.

The day they travelled and the 2-3 days after, I basically lost it! I was constantly in bed throughout the day with light-headedness, need to lie down, hopelessness, body on full alert, zero appetite for anything, slightly alleviated heart rate, high stress alerts on my Garmin watch, and the feeling that maybe and perhaps death is better than what I was feeling though not suicidal. I tried walking outside for an hour/day, taking to friends, keeping sitcoms/sports on the background always, changing rooms in the house, it might work for 1-2 hours but then I would spiral back. I couldn't meet anyone since again lockdown.

The only solution to this very new situation was for me to take the risk of travelling across the world to meet my family and my extended family (parents/siblings) and take a break from work. In retrospect, I should have visited the ER but I was glad I travelled since upon arrival with family, I was essentially back to normal (albeit with a persisting jet lag).

**2- Travelling Back Home**

So things were okay among family. But then we were to travel back home in one week. I made sure to be on the same return flight with my wife and kids. However, all of a sudden, the symptoms/episodes/attacks resurfaced with the thoughts of returning to cold weather and lockdown and never-ending lack of socialization due to COVID. 

My parents noticed and referred me to a psychiatrist 2-3 days prior to my travel. He suspected GAD and prescribed Xanax for management till I figure out a long term solution. So, I did take Xanax for the next 3 days including the flight and it definitely helped. Surprisingly, once back home things were back to normal! I was back to my work/life routine. Lockdown and quarantine were not convenient but nothing major.

**3- Death of the Parent of Best Friend**

I was okay for 2-3 weeks. I was even seeing a psychotherapist weekly via Zoom just to make sure I resolve whatever was going on. But I didn't have any symptoms nor did I even consider Xanax during that time. 

Then, my best friend's father passed away all of a sudden due to a heart attack. So, surprise surprise, my symptoms resurfaced albeit less intensely than before. I was still able to do work and function. However, the lightheadedness and feeling of hopelessness would persist for 3-4 hours per day but most of the day I was relatively okay. Ideas of death, mortality, aging, any news of death or sickness, or thoughts of my parents dying, etc. were very very annoying and persistent (no concerns around lockdown anymore!). I considered retaking Xanax since the prescription I had was mostly unused but figured I need to see a psychiatrist for follow-up.

I talked to a new psychiatrist, referred by my GP, over the phone for just 20 minutes. He really didn't ask many questions (except if I use alcohol or drugs, which I don't). He then concluded that yes GAD is the right diagnosis and that I should take Lexapro 10mg. That was 10 days ago. I got the prescription but it is still closed shut.

Now, I am considering just taking Xanax for the 3-4 hours per day in which I feel down as opposed to getting my self dependent on Lexapro with its side effects and then withdrawal in case it doesn't work or if the side effects are too severe. I am really torn. The psychiatrist who prescribed Lexapro suggested that I stop taking Xanax due to the risk of addiction. So I can't really consult him again on the matter + my prescription for Xanax would suffice me for a month.

I am currently thinking to myself that I have spent the majority of 35 years with no major depression/anxiety (I pretty sure I had a mild case since I overthink, I worry, and I have high empathy). So I am thinking that the past two months have been the aberration, which I can handle with temporary solutions (Xanax, exercise, counselling, etc.) as opposed to an anti-depressant that would at least tie me up for the next several months. Am I in denial? 

Has anyone experienced this sudden spike in anxiety/depression at adulthood and never returned back to their previous state on their own or at least without medication?

TL;DR: I never experienced major depression/anxiety/panic episodes (very minor) but over the past two months I experienced a major spike in which these episodes are easily triggered especially by ideas or news of death or sickness. I am apprehensive of going on (prescribed) Lexapro since I keep convincing myself that these two months are the exception and not the rule moving forward.

(Warning ahead, a possible mistypes and grammar errors, English not my native language )

So lately I have been dealing with a weird disorder of anxiety that lead me to have an urgency to pee during a ride in a public bus or riding a car, etc  being in public bus knowing there bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

That anxiety developed after an accident, Where me and my friends from work was going for outing at the beach and I had drink alot of water that day without entering the bathroom.

So i was holding my pee for almost like 2 hours in shy of telling the drive (my friend) to stop at any near restroom or empty space to pee, and ofcourse once I arrived to the beach I reached quickly for the nearest bathroom but sadly once I unzipped my pants I start to pee at once and ruined my underwear and pants that day.

&amp;#x200B;

A week after that accident, I was going back from work like normal and that day i forget to enter bathroom before i leave ofcourse during my ride in the public bus i start to feel the urgency to pee and i started to get flash backs to the week before where i did pee myself and start to questions.

Anyway i got off and went to near empty space, pee and moved on from that day i start to have this urgency to pee always whenever i get on public bus or ride a car.

I suspect there something physical wrong with me and went to two doctors , one of them there could be problem with my prostate but there was no clear sign of anything wrong with me (Atleast physical ) aside from the urgency.

Anyway the second doctor, told me if I don't have any sign beside urgency and my tests are all clear that mean there nothing wrong with my body but more of my mind having a flash back even if is unconscious during suggest that it mental problem.

I went along with that since all other treatments didn't go for me (On point of going for  psychologist  ) Anyway wearing headphones during my public bus ride , listing to music or work on breath rhythm to relax myself was working to a degree but the case doesn't hold anymore atleast one day it's fine and the other day its not.

I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell.

Being on a 50mg dose took the edge off of my anxiety and panic attacks, but I always had that uneasy feeling and anxious that would come up...I didn't communicate this to my doctor until September of last year, for no reason other than I don't typically share well... Anyway, after telling him, we increased the dose to 100mg, which took that feeling away, but rendered my dick bubblegum... So I told my doctor immediately, because the best motivator for me honestly is sex... I've always had a crazy high sex drive and no matter the dose I never lost that drive.... So the drive is still there, but my dick decided to take a  sabbatical without informing the rest of me.
   So I tell my doctor, he says it's normal and I believe him, and he prescribed Bupropion... Which slowly worked over a period of a couple months, going going from having sex with half hard sponges to a decent erection, very useable... But never rock hard.
  Then recently, I don't know what happened but I had a panic attack in the middle of sex with my girlfriend... Which I have to say she has been amazing and supportive through this entire thing. I couldn't ask or dream of anyone to be more lucky have at my side than her. Since the episode, I'm now constantly in my head about ever being a good lover again to her...I love her so much and I hate that I'm putting her through this... With my sex drive we still do everything, but like my dick will get hard through masturbation, but the second there's the least bit of ""hiccup"" during sex (position change, awkward hole miss, anything uncomfortable, etc...) my dick instantly goes soft and bails due to my thoughts of ""It's happening again"" or "" I'm a disappointment"", even through I'm crazy turned on.
My girlfriend and I have great communication and share... But it's like no matter what she says or does,I can't get these thoughts out of my head.

Mentally I'm a mess now and physically I'm incredibly sexually frustrated.... And I have no idea what to do.

Edit: Oh I forgot to mention... My doctor and I have listed the dose of Sertraline back to 50mg and kept me on the Bupropion 100mg.",Anxiety,SSRi has given me performance anxiety and I don't know what to do...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lrge6t/ssri_has_given_me_performance_anxiety_and_i_dont/,1614154155.0

I felt it coming and always do (cold sweats, nauseous, lightheaded) but did not want to make a scene by leaving the front of the church where I was with bridesmaids to sit down.  Would have been less of a scene in hindsight than me falling to the ground LOL!!!!   I wrote it off due to eating small meals the day of the wedding, not being hydrated, uncomfortable shoes, hot day, etc.  However, a year later I was in another wedding and did not faint but the whole time was feeling like it could happen at any moment.  I walked out of the church and burst into tears just from the stress/anxiety and swore I would not be in any other weddings!  I did everything right that day... drank water, wore flats, stayed cool, ate bigger meals and still felt like I was seconds away from fainting.  This is not the only times this has happened.  I am starting to realize its not lack of food or any of those things it's simply anxiety and feeling stressed/pressure and happens almost every time I get a rush of adrenaline (ie being at front of church).  It almost happened at a work meeting where everyone was standing up and I wasn't even the center of attention but almost convinced myself everyone was watching and started feeling faint. It's totally a in my head/mental thing.......

That being said I am in 3 this fall.   I could cry just thinking about it.   I have told all the brides my concern and they say they will put me at end near chair or pew.  I hate this so much.

It has gotten better overall, at least the derealization is almost gone. The pressure on my head and ears, sort of this ""absorbent cotton feeling in my head"" is still there. Also my memory and concentration is not like before. My anxiety has lessened as I am in therapy and taking 5mg of Lexapro. I had all kinds of blood tests last month, from thyroid to MRI scan of my head. It's all good. It must be the anxiety. Looking at the subreddit ""Brain Fog"" just scares me that it could be something else. Does anyone know the feeling and can tell me if it goes away? What is the best thing to do, accept it and move on? Is brain fog part of derealization?

42,virgoqueen123,1614180301,"My anxiety is often triggered by staying in the moment, or rather, the struggle to do so. I get so caught up in trying to be present that I begin to panic, thinking it's impossible, or not worth the energy. The present moment is so fleeting; everything is a memory in the making, but my anxiety comes to a head when I worry that I won't be able to remember those memories that I'm making as they are unfolding. I get depressed when I remember that everything is temporary, so I begin forcing my presence so as to enjoy what I have when I have it, and it becomes a very exhausting way of living.

The trigger concerns death, health issues and can be external or internal. So if I start feeling sicker than usual I start having an anxiety attack that progressively worsen what may have been for example just my wisdom tooth on fire for a bit, if someone mention someone getting diagnosed with X thing it gives me anxiety. 
If someone talk about what could happen if X thing happens ""you could one day get sick like this"" I get triggered once more. Even first aid courses do the trigger to me and it all started around 4 years ago when, visiting a friend after a surgery in an hospital, I suddenly had my first anxiety attack with a big panic attack that made me lose senses and steal my friend spot on the bed.

In all honesty, it is starting to become a nuisance in my life, especially now that we are under pandemics I had to isolate myself completely from the TV and the outside world without constant triggers to my anxiety, but I also believe evading the issue isn't exactly the problem.


I do not know how should I consider what I have, what is the source or how to fight it.

46,thhrrrooowwawaayyy,1614179684,"Hi there reddit, I guess i'm looking for help in understanding somethings I am feeling. Apologies in advance for the vague description but I feel like it is quite hard to explain what I am feeling. For context, I definitely suffer with anxiety, specifically social anxiety and I am currently doing CBT to help me with that, however I kind of feel that what I am experiencing is a bit different.

When I was younger, from time to time I would get this recurring nightmare, and from what I remember I most often got it when I stayed at my grandparents house. It was a very abstract kind of nightmare where I was in a big white room that seemed to be never-ending, and there were loads of people in it who wherever I went followed me with their eyes ( i don't remember actual people but more so the feeling of eyes everywhere watching me wherever i go). I also experienced objects distorting shapes such as getting really big, really small, really long and skinny as if it was being stretched etc. Overall, I felt this intense fear/panic which is related to what I have experienced while conscious and awake. Very occasionally, I have while being awake experienced this same type of overwhelming fear and panic that did not necessarily arise from something (i can't recall any particular stressor which is why i don't think there was one). The reason I mentioned the dream is that it is because it is the same sense of fear that I have never experienced other than these few incidences. Just there, I once again felt this extreme fear and panic come over me and I almost felt as if someone was talking to me i'm not sure why because there was no actual voice in my head but rather the feeling. I felt extremely stressed and panicked and managed to calm myself down by deep breathing. Not sure if this is relevant, but my heart was beating very quickly and as I was calming down I looked at my fitbit and saw my heart rate was 107, which eventually got down to 80 when I had fully calmed down (I know fitbits can be inaccurate, I just thought i'd include all and any information). I feel fine now, and the feeling has gone. I don't think it was a panic attack as such, but felt like my own version of one.

I guess what I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this, why it happened, how to deal with it, basically anything that could help me understand it a bit.

This has been accompanied by an array of physical symptoms, so much so that I consicously don't realise I am anxious most of the time, but I know it by some unexplained pain in my body. 

The symptoms are becoming more varied and less easy to dismiss (I had stomach issues for a couple of years, and when I finally managed to end them, I got palpitations. After confirming they were harmless, I had chest pains, then a globus sensation etc. etc. There were at least 50 more in between.)

93,FreshlyBrewedT,1614162079,"20 M 150 pounds. 

I’m a bit of a hypochondriac. Constantly worrying about my breathing/heart. I’ve made strides to become more healthy, lost 55 pounds in 8 months. I made a doctors appointment to kind of prove that I was healthy. The nurse took my vitals and perfectly normal blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels. But then I asked for an EKG just to be sure. 

The nurse messed up on the wiring several times during the test and had to reposition them and then told me I had to go see a cardiologist because I had a variable heart rate. I was kind of internally freaking out at this point. The doctor decides to do a second EKG (also messing up the wiring a couple times and me being mentally anxious as well) and says that my variable heart rate was an error, but that I have a possible left atrial enlargement. They weren’t even positive it was real because my blood pressure was healthy, and didn’t think much of it because otherwise if they were really worried they would’ve checked me in. but they still want me to pay $500 for an ultrasound, just to be sure.

But my anxious mind can’t stop thinking that I went from worrying about a heart attack, to worrying about having potential heart failure. When I got my vitals that relieved a ton of stress and worry, until I asked for an EKG. They didn’t even see the need to have one done, but I asked and now I’m stressed from possible human error. And now I have more questions and fears than answers. 

They also wanted to do blood tests to make sure my weight loss was normal, which freaks me out too because now instead of me trying hard to make healthy habits, my mind thinks that I lost all that weight because I have a serious disease or because my heart is failing. I just can’t win.

I’m 20, normal weight, normal vitals, no family history of heart problems, never experienced palpitations or any heart problem besides some anxiety attacks. And yet I think my hearts failing. It’s ridiculous.

112,djdisciplejosh,1614156544,"It was around November 2020. I was in year 2 of 2 my final year of college. I was supposed to graduate this year in April 2021. 

I stated my program in September 2019 as normal. It was mainly meant to be a very hands on program. But then the pandemic hit in 2020 and we were all forced into remote learning. I didn't have a problem with that at the beginning. I really struggled with depression and anxiety during my first year and I really did struggle in school as I wasn't doing well. I barely passed my first year.

Fast forward to September 2020 going on to my final year. It was all remote learning but with some instances of in person learning. It was a multimedia program with photography, videography, graphic design, web design, media writing, etc.. But when I started my second year I realized that I couldn't focus at all during remote learning. Even though I could ask questions during video classes it just wasn't the same. I felt like I was pretty much on my and left to figure things out for myself.

But then come mid November 2020. I realize that I was failing 2 of my 6 classes and in danger of failing another. I wasn't doing too well in my other class either. For two assignments from those two classes I was failing, I totally bombed them. I never did well in those classes despite me trying my hardest. Now I'm not blaming my failures on my mental health, that's on me, I don't care. I take full responsibility for my failures. I'm not necessarily a lazy or careless student and I while I'm not an academic exemplar, I do try to complete my assignments on time 

But at the same time, I really wasn't in the right state of mind. My depression and anxiety got worse that year. Mid November was when I hit my breaking point. It was a Sunday morning. I was laying on the couch just with extreme anxiety over my failures in school. I was just spaced out. I realized that my body started to get weaker and weaker. I felt all my energy was drained and I had to muster up every last bit of strength to drag myself to my bedroom. 

I instantly went to sleep. After a while I woke up and at that point I literally couldn't move at all. I felt sick and stated having chills. I don't know if it was some underlying sickness or what. But I felt very weak that day. I could barely eat or stay awake.

I felt that was my breaking point. That was it. There was no hope of me passing my courses or being able to get my grades back up in time. Just thinking about school really stressed me out. That's when I decided to drop out entirely.

Now mind you that since I mainly plan on going into photography and videography as a freelancer, a college degree isn't necessarily required. I do have a bit of experience (not a pro) in those fields. So dropping out isn't necessarily going to negatively impact my future. But the fact that I dropped out makes me feel like a total failure and I fear that will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

I've also been working part time at my local store during school. I'm now considering seeking professional help. I know of one facility in my region and my workplace has connections to mental health counseling. I sometimes just have trouble reaching out or telling someone at work. My boss is a pretty cool guy and he cares for his employees. He always asks how I'm doing and seems genuinely concerned. I feel like I could come clean to him. But my HR manager is a different story since she's the one who mainly deals with that kind of stuff. She's kinda mean (although she's a tiny bit nicer now) she temporarily replaced my old HR manager who's on remote assignment (whatever that means). The old HR manager was really nice and understanding compared to the current one.

I tried telling my mom about it but the doesn't believe me and just thinks I'm weak, especially as a young, 22 year old male. I feel that makes it kinda more difficult to seek help. I'm sometimes tempted to get into smoking weed (I'm in Canada so recreational use is completely legal) and drinking just to try and cope. When I'm depressed I imagine myself smoking a blunt. I've never done those things before and never wanted to but I just feel so depressed and anxious I'm getting to the point where I just don't care about myself anymore.

People at work and my mom always keep asking me how's school. I have to keep lying to them saying ""it's good"". It's like people are cheering me on. I'm kinda getting tired of having to lie to people. I'm scared of what people would think if I told them the truth that I dropped out. They'd probably think negatively of me.

I haven't officially been diagnosed with depression and anxiety by a professional, but I've been feeling those things for over 2 years now. I've dropped out of school mainly because of it (again not blaming my mental health I take full responsibility).

I've been in a huge tailspin since I was let go from a job 2.5 years ago. Since that time, I've completely cut off everyone who isn't immediate family, turned down job offers, moved back in with my parents, and now I'm halfway done this program that I have no confidence in myself in.

I've always had some sort of social anxiety/depression since I was young, but never really dealt with it other than some occasional talks with a family doctor/therapist/counselor.

I spend majority of my time in my head worrying, overthinking, playing out different scenarios and in a constant brainfog. I finally recognized I had a problem this weekend when I ordered CBD drops to help me try relaxing. I took 10-15 drops (1 drop = 4 CBD) every day but I felt almost nothing. So one day I said fuck it and decided to drink half of the bottle. 

After 30 min to an hour I started feeling this weird sense of sleepy/high like state, my legs started becoming completely relaxed and it almost felt like they are going to melt into the bed, my muscles started to twitch (which is weird) but for some reason it felt really good (like all the stress was leaving them), I could finally think normally and I could actually pick up a thing, think about it and then drop it once I was done with it instead of constantly thinking about it in the back of my mind. It also felt like my cognition and attention got so much better and I could actually respond to my friends with actual constructive statements instead of just socially anxious ones. Then the next day came around and BOOM just like that I was back in my anxious old self.

Moreover, my contract stipulates that I must be at school even when there are no clases, unless I take vacation days.  As a result, I’ve been sitting in an empty office for several days straight.

To cut it short, I was given a blood test and an ultrasound. In the end they found that my spleen is enlarged. They also noticed my liver isn't as smooth as it should have looked in an ultrasound. Some context here is that I was born with Hepatitis C.

Doctor notified me of the results and said the digestive issues are likely their own thing and prescribed me pantoprazole.

He then let me know about the spleen and said its likely related to my hepatitis, and that I should go forward and make steps to get it treated.

Now here I am today losing my mind. I'm hyperaware of every little feeling in my body. I keep worrying about death. I keep wondering if there's more they didn't see. I keep dreading the act of finding out more incase I'm dying in my early 30s.

I've given you a roof to live, food and everything else, just be respectful.""

I'm living in a garage next to my aunt's house so I have no choice but to work and finish my education as I'm planning to be a doctor, to make my parents and my grandparents proud. My grandparents have never bat an eye towards me, but they adore my younger sister because as a child, her dream was to be a doctor which she is rethinking right now. I feel like my grandparents are trying their best to like me because I'm full-filling their dreams.

I have so much pressure at school, work and at home. Whenever I don't want to do the chores at home. My mom would flip and scream at me, so I have no choice and do shit when I don't feel like it. I have to do my assignments because I can't have a bad grade.

I have no one to talk to about what I'm feeling because everyone is having their problems and I should be lucky with what I have. My co-workers are having their hardships too. One of my co-workers dad just passed away and some have a hard time with paying rent and all.

I don't want to die but the things that I used to be happy about gives me pain and pain feels numb. I've been crying to sleep, just because I want to escape.

My parents don't support it and they are ashamed of me for having it. I would always have a hard time not being with him, so whenever people talk about death.

For a few years I’ve noticed I will pick up on a certain phrase or set of words which I will then repeat a couple times a day for about a month. Eventually I’ll move onto a different phrase. This month I’ve been quoting an old vine I completely forgot about and last month I would say “Not my problem” to pretty much anything. I watch lots of TV shows and have a tendency to talk to myself so it usually pops up when I’m doing those activities. 
For example, my sister was showing my mom a new trick she learned yesterday and was taking a while to set it up. My current phrase is “Do a flip!” So I subconsciously said it out loud. This is pretty common and happens multiple times a day even though sometimes it (the phrase) will have nothing to do with anything around me. I’m not repeating it multiple times in a row or (seemingly) to soothe myself so it’s gotten me curious if it’s an anxiety symptom that is less common and I’ve just never heard about.

148,Jtrev16,1614141675,"A little background:  I (42F) started dealing with an anxiety and panic disorder about 7 years ago but brought it under control with meds and therapy.  The severe anxiety crept in again last year at the start of the pandemic, but again has been bought under control with therapy and adjustments to my medication.  I have not had any severe anxiety symptoms or panic attacks in over 4 months. 

The last few weeks at work have been terribly stressful - long hours in zoom meetings trying to solve difficult problems.  Today my eyes were tired so I put on my new reading glasses.  I’m not quite used to them yet so the stuff on the computer screen seemed a little warped.  Soon I realized that there were weird, white tiny blind spots in my left eye where I couldn’t focus on the screen. Decided to take a quick lunch break but as I was using the microwave I noticed the vision in that eye getting worse.  I wasn’t wearing the reading glasses at that point.  

This set off some serious anxiety. I went to the ladies room and noticed a sensation of flashing lights going across my vision in thin vertical lines, especially in my left eye.  I could even see the flashing when I closed my eyes.  It was kind of like what you experience if you stare at a bright light and then go into a dark room, but it didn’t go away.  Now I’m starting to panic.  I was pacing the halls and the flashing increased in intensity until it was like I had tunnel vision in both eyes but instead of the peripheral vision going dark it was filled with hundreds of tiny bright flashing lights.  I could barely see. Worried that I was having a stroke I had a full blown panic attack. I seriously considered calling my husband or asking a coworker to bring me to the hospital but instead decided to take an emergency dose of Xanax and go outside for some air.  

Within 10-15 minutes of taking the Xanax my vision returned to normal and the panic subsided.  Still worried about a stoke, I walked a block to a local drug store and had my blood pressure taken and it was normal.  Of course I was hyper aware of my vision for the rest of the day but it’s been fine ever since and I’ve had no additional anxiety or unusual symptoms. 

Has anyone experienced this with anxiety?  I was stressed but not feeling anxious prior to the incident. During my first bout with anxiety 7 years ago I would get minor visual disturbances during high anxiety but nothing even close to approaching this level and it hasn’t happened in years.  

A friend said it sounded like a migraine aura but I’m not prone to migraines.  I also don’t have diabetes or any other conditions that could cause visual disturbances.   I’m hoping to chalk this up to a strange anxiety symptom but, again, it was scary.  Any thoughts from my fellow anxiety sufferers?

Tried going back to bed and my thoughts shifted to my breathing and a thought I have quite often popped up: ""You're not breathing enough. You're not getting enough air. If you stop breathing manually, you'll die'.

I dated my friend at the end of high school and even though we went to separate colleges, we kept dating. My freshman year of college though, I was having a really difficult time liking my major, which caused a ton of tension with my parents and I failed 5 classes that year and lost a really big scholarship to the school. After I failed that first semester, and lied about my grades to my parents, my mental health got really bad and through the end of the semester into the next I was drinking a lot, not studying for anything, and ignoring and lashing out at my boyfriend. He was always so kind to me and sent me letters every week and tried to help me and give me advice but I just refused to listen. Beginning of spring semester that year, we broke up. I was still failing classes and I was still being a bitch to him when he would reach out. He would ask to be my friend and I kept pushing him away. He still sent me letters, he still told me he always had time to talk to me, anything. I kept pushing it away. 

The following year after my parents found out about losing my scholarship, and I changed my major to something I loved, I began going to therapy to sort out a lot of problems. My ex and I were talking rarely. That's pretty much how it stayed up until COVID began. I got sent home and because of loneliness and starting to fix those problems of how I'd turn people away, we reached out to each other again. We caught up and it was awesome! In June of 2020 we started dating again as both of us always had a feeling that we would get back together if it felt right. And it did. He was super proud of my progress with therapy and school and I kept and still am attending therapy to keep progressing. 

The only problem is, I see old texts, old letters, and listen to old voicemails, and even see pictures from that time where I was being such a bitch to him, ignoring him, and not reciprocating that love. And it fucking kills me. My actions show that I am no longer that person, but it fills me with rage. How I could have fixed myself earlier, or reached out earlier to him, I wouldn't have treated him so poorly for so long. Both of us notice a change in me now and we both see that I am no longer doing that, but how do I just stop the regrets working my anxiety up to the point I don't think he should have feelings for me or that I am unlovable/don't deserve love?

Anyways. I’d say I’ve had anxiety for a while but it’s gotten worse over the past 2 years. Stress level has been high since I started nursing school and Covid created lots of changes in my life. 

I decided to see a psychiatrist. Been doing therapy for about a year which has helped but I’ve been having stagnant anxiety for the past couple months with no improvement. She prescribed lexapro at the lowest dose (5mg) to see how I do. But of course it’s super hard to get a person with anxiety to take a medication. Especially one who is about to graduate as a nurse. I over analyze EVERYTHING. So here are my doubts and if you can share your experience or any insight I would be so grateful.

1. I’m scared of the long term effects of the drug. I’ve done some research and it seems that doctors don’t really know exactly how SSRIs work. And studies have shown substantial decreases in serotonin pathways (SERT) by just 21 days of use. Of course this was in rats. But yeah just seeing limited research and scared that it will alter my brain chemistry. Although I understand it’s what it’s set to do. 

2. I do socially drink and am a little apprehensive because I am young and will end up taking anti anxiety  meds for something that is so frustrating that I feel already puts me behind others but ALSO makes me not drink and have less fun. My psychiatrist said I could drink but have to see how my body reacts. 

3. Scared that I’ll be dependent on it. 

4. Biggest thing of all, I’m scared to change. Yes it would be nice to be able to relax and not have non stop thinking. But anxiety to an extent makes up my personality and also I believe is what makes me good in nursing school because nurses do need to analyze a lot. 

The plan is to take it for about a year to help me finish out school and tackle big obstacles and life changes I have ahead of me to get me to a stable place so I can come off and not relapse.

184,BAKS7U,1614132739,"Hi. I’ve experienced panic attacks ever since I was 18 but they were lasting no longer than a few minutes and didn’t occur more often than once a year or every few months. Since December 2020 it’s changed and it’s been almost every day or every other day. Decided to see psychiatrist and he said I have anxiety. Prescribed me clonazepam to take twice or three times a day depending on my needs and escitalopram to take once a day and take both these meds for 2 weeks until escitalopram starts working and see if I can get off clonazepam and keep taking only one med and keep clonazepam just nearby at all times in case I need to ever use it.


My questions are:


1.	Is my doctor right with the suggested first treatment?

2.	I would hate to get addicted but I guess getting addicted to meds that have little side effects is better than big anxiety attacks. How easily is it to get addicted?

3.	If escitalopram turns out to be working do I need to take it my whole life?


4.	should I see someone to talk or it’s not required if meds work?

5.	if you have other information I should know please post

It used to be just twitches of the neck or screwing my eyes shut really tight, but now, whenever I remember something embarrassing or have an invasive/ worrying thought, my whole body reacts.

I've never been diagnosed for a tic disorder, nor do I believe I have one. I just don't understand why this is happening to me.

Lately, I have been having severe anxiety over decision-making. I am not talking about major life decisions, but rather day-to-day, seemingly trivial things like grocery-shopping, choosing hobbies, hanging out with friends, and so on. I have been ruminating for sometimes hours on end about how to make a decision; any time I get closer to making it, I get extremely anxious because I am afraid it is ""not quite right"" or I missed out on a better choice. Then it's back to square one, where I then become even more anxious over how much time I wasted being indecisive. I can't pick a book to read and instead spend hours reading up on reviews to find something ""perfect."" I cancel plans because I am afraid I may want to do something else. I spend way too long at the grocery store reading labels and obsessing over the right choices, wasting my evening. 

It's strange, because I feel pretty okay about choosing a residency program to start this summer (I am about to graduate from medical school). It's as if some of the major choices appear much more obvious, e.g. ""this choice means a good salary, family, etc."" but it's the day-to-day that is making me almost dysfunctional. 

I know this is all extremely privileged as so many people in the world don't have the luxury of so many choices, which makes me feel really bad about myself. I have tried meditation, but it hasn't been helping me. I work out most days, but for some reason lately it has just made me feel more activated.

A little backstory: I have GAD, tried CBT for a few months which if anything made my anxiety 5x worse, and finally got prescribed antidepressants a couple weeks ago. 

Nurse tried me on Sertraline but I have tinnitus and the med really seemed to aggravate it to the point I had to stop taking it, so I switched to Fluoxetine. I’ve taken about 6 tablets so far, and the past few days my mouth has been so dry it feels impossible to swallow and it’s making me feel sick. I know it sounds like such an inconsequential thing but on top of that it’s a vicious cycle with my anxiety because now I’m worried about dental problems and gum disease. 

So my question is - do I stick with the meds a bit longer? Could the side effect ease off in the next few weeks? Or should I talk to the nurse about stopping?

Is it in your face, trembling hands, your stomach, chest, tense shoulders? I've also heard that paying attention to these raw physical sensations with curiosity is better than worrying (which also reduces anxiety by giving you some sense of control) and because the fight or flight response only persists if you continue having panicky thoughts about the anxiety. Does anyone have personal experience with this?

I've also found that re-categorizing my anxiety as excietement can help, but I'm still thinking when doing that rather than mindfully attending to the physical sensations alone.

As the title says, I don't know where to start with getting help. I know I need help, but feel like there are so many obstacles in place which are preventing me from getting it.

I am an 18 year old male, live in the UK, unemployed since left school, living at home with my mother (who suffers from a lot of issues herself), her partner and my grandmother. I have suffered from social anxiety since I was very young. Over the last 3 years it has gotten much worse and also led into depression. Most days my family are quite toxic with each other which means I spend most, if not all days in my room.

I've known for at least a year now that I can't carry on like this. I need help. My life is just passing by and I feel like there isn't any progress at all. I'm ashamed that I'm unemployed and still living off my parents at 18. I'm not even claiming any benefits because I am unable to do the commitments required to get any money (going to interviews with the Job Centre, phone calls etc...) all because of my anxiety. I don't even know how I'm going to get any form of job anytime soon, not only because of the pandemic but I also don't drive and live in a rural area, so jobs around here are very hard to come by as it is, now throw anxiety into the mix too and it just makes it seem impossible. Just the thought of going to interviews makes me feel extremely sick and just doesn't feel possible at all.

Getting help for this is also an issue. I know that the first step is to go to my GP, but I am unable to do that. I cannot even pick up the phone and make an appointment, my anxiety gets overwhelming. Also, after reading other people's experiences of getting mental health help on the NHS, it doesn't fill me with confidence, from long waiting lists and then not even getting much out of it at the end, it makes me question if it's even worth the hassle. The only other option is to go see a private therapist, but the problem here is that I cannot afford it.

I just feel hopeless and completely lost. I feel stuck in a vicious cycle, like there's no way out. I feel anxious from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep.

Who knows. It baffles me how the human body is made up of so many intricate structures and they all come together to create something that seems impossible. I don’t believe any amount of science will be able to allow us to comprehend how we can feel love and suffering so deeply.

The beginning of life on this planet was magic in itself. Somehow the first organisms had the innate desire to survive. Where did this come from?

There has been no rule book for life and yet we have created rules for ourselves. I used to firmly believe that death is a fact of life, but with the progress of science even this is becoming unclear.

Life is magical. Maybe not in the sense of unicorns and wizards. However the world, universe and basically existence as a whole is truly amazing. Somehow everything has come together to allow us to live and thrive on this floating rock. We can create the most amazing art, when once nothing existed.

245,Lady-Lapis,1614115791,"Warning: wall of overly detailed text.

Backstory: somebody opened a credit account in my dad's name. We received a debt card in the mail from a bank we don't use.We got the account frozen and my parents have just left for the bank to get this sorted out. I'll update when they return.

While his name and address can be accessed from public record, this person needed his SSN to open the account. We still don't know how they got it. My paranoid brain keeps thinking that this my fault. That the fraud happened because of something I did online.

To be clear, I even don't know my dad's SSN and would never give it to anyone if I did. I've never given anyone my number either. I don't use social media sites, very rarely if ever use my real name. Also, my dad and I don't use the same devices, so there is no way someone could have gotten his info from my computer alone.

I've never used the deep web or dark web, but I sometimes do internet deep dives looking for lost and obscure media. Sometimes these sites are not in English and can be pretty weird.

I don't know why, but I'd feel really embarrassed if I had to explain what I was doing to someone who didn't understand what it was or why is was doing it. I really don't like answering questions about my hobbies and how I use my time. Hell, I don't like watching movies or share my music or books with other people, because they always seem to want to talk about it and I'm uncomfortable doing that.

Finally, I admit to pirating anime and other fansubbed shows. Anything I download is found on the surface web. I never downloaded any thing that is illegal to own. At one point a few years ago, I had a month long subscription at a premium file sharing site. Barely a month after my subscription ended, the site was taken down by authorities. Apparently some sick jerks on the dark web were using it to distribute illegal content. For a while, I was worried the police come for me even though I never downloaded anything illegal.

Anyway, I'm worried that whomever is looking into the fraud case will say to my parents ""It's your daughter's fault this happened. She went to some weird website and some guy tracked her and then stole all your info."" Which of course will lead to my family yelling and interrogating me about what I was doing. Even though I did nothing illegal, I'll still be embarrassed and ashamed, while fearfully explaining myself to them. In the end, my reputation with family will be ruined, and I will be weirdo who almost ruined their lives.

I'd like it if someone could explain to me how this couldn't be my fault, that I'm just paranoid.

Also, sorry for all the run on sentences. I just noticed that I typed out several.

During my senior year of high school I had a panic attack for the first time ever about ten minutes into my first class of the day. Something about being trapped in that class room in the same seat for the next hour or so didn't sit right with me that day even though it was never a problem in all my years of school before that. My home life at the time was a disaster that's too complicated to get into on one post but on top of that I also drank an energy drink damn near every morning before school for a few weeks leading up to that point on top of a long cigarette addiction and the occasional teenage drinking and pot smoking (never really more than 1-2x per week). At the time I had no idea what was going on. I went to the nurse and would feel fine only to feel unbelievable panic when returning to class. Something about not being able to show any signs of distress else being talked about relentlessly (stupid reasoning looking back, but a bigger deal while in high school) or even being able to freely leave the classroom without drawing attention really amped me up and gave me awful panic attacks that only got worse as I avoided these situations. I ended up finishing high school online because I was so blindsided by this happening and I couldn't find a way to get over it. Didn't walk at graduation because of fear of having a panic attack at some point during the ceremony.

After high school things calmed down some and I distanced myself from my shitty home life (despite all of the problems still existing, I just geographically removed myself from them to a few miles away). I went into college and felt much better in a classroom since the rules weren't as strict as high school and I could basically up and leave whenever I felt like it with no explanation to anyone. I still had a very hard time giving speeches though, or basically talking in front of a group at all. Anytime I would have to do a speech I would have a fear of having a panic attack during the speech. Occasionally I would be able to get through a short speech with obvious signs of distress that were embarrassing. What bothers me is that you can't just stop in the middle of talking like that without someone knowing somethings up. This fear applies to so many things in my life that fall under the same principles, such as driving over a bridge, flying in a plane, and even just talking in front of a small group of like 8 people in my office at work in a weekly meeting. The fear of the panic causes panic itself and it feels like an exhausting endless loop that makes me avoid things forever. 

Fast forward now I'm 26 and I've been dealing with this for close to 10 years and I have found some things help like quitting caffeine, nicotine and THC (occasional drinking still but I really should cut back). Overall though I still feel strong panic attacks in certain situations that really impede on me living my life. For example, I can't fly anywhere because of a fear of having a panic attack on a plane and not being able to escape. I really can't help shake the feeling that if I took better care of myself mentally and physically in high school at the time of the first panic attack then I wouldn't have these problems. I was so heavily shook from that experience and not equipped to deal with it and it just snowballed for years and became a bigger issue. It really is a fucked up cycle that panic causes more panic and only digs you deeper.

Anyways thanks if you read through that wall of text and I would love to hear any feedback given this was the first time I've laid things out and didn't just try my best to ignore my problems. If there's a specific name for the anxiety I feel I think it would help for me to know so I can read up on it.

TLDR; had panic attacks in high school that seem to be triggered by the feeling of being trapped and/or social embarrassment in acknowledging my anxiety. Fast forward, full blown grown up now that still gets triggered in situations like flights, speeches, sometimes driving. Things with no easy exit route.

What i am starting to notice is, that some of the times it is actually more the fear of concentration or focusing... As an example any time i write an essay, like I do now, 24 hours before the deadline:

I always want to start early and be well prepared so I am not having to write everything the days before the deadline like I always end up. The same as now. I am starting early, researching, etc. But i actually never really write anything down i want to have on the final paper; I am just putting many different quotes and context on to a different paper, cutting a lot out again, changing them,... 90% of the time I am working on this ""draft paper"" rather than actually writing. And what I am noticing now more and more is that I am always starting with the works which require the least focus and concentration. Until the very last minute I keep on doing this every time. Only copying things, finding a loooot of sources, finding many different opinions... It is like I am afraid of understanding the topic, deciding or getting my thoughts straight and being able to have a nice finished paper... I cannot really tell what it could be that i am afraid of...

I really have no idea what this fear is exactly and where it comes from. Writing on my actual final paper is always a fight. It literally takes so much energy from me and for every word i write I have to push myself as if i would have to run through a wall of fire...

I had a panic attack last week and since i've been having trouble with eating properly.

But I've trained my body to pretty much ignore it if i'm hungry, i could go hours without eating.

I'm really trying to keep this short but its going to be difficult.

**I'm a 30 years old male who suffers from anxiety when I have some symptoms I get pretty hypochondriac.** 

I know that you aren't doctors or so, I am just trying to write something here because I am getting really crazy and maybe this will help myself to keep some protocol.

My ex girlfriend **quit me 2 years ago(7 y of relationship)** while she was pregnant **after 3 months of pregnancy,** which hit me pretty hard.  **Since then I wanted to change my life and I started to make some progress.**

I **got a cat to feel better to get some love** and I developed **a cat allergy** so basically most of the time **I am locked in my room** because my cat can't **enter the room** and my flatmate also has a cat.

My history below maybe not relevant but its really hitting me hard because I had to do a lot of stuff the last 24 months.

My drug history:

1. Weed: I have been smoking weed for about 13 years. I had to stop as I developed CHS(cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome). **Stopped smoking  in December 2020.**
2.  Benzos: I was given a benzos due to my spike of panic attacks due to CHS. I discovered later that I had CHS once I got off the benzos. **Stopped August 2020.**
3. Antidepressants: Got of them too after benzos.
4. Smoking: I quit smoking **about 2 months and switched to vaping**.
5. Had also a pretty bad abuse with stimulants &amp; feel good pills (Adderall and other street stims) in my past years 20-25. I sweared to myself never again to use them since what happened this weekend.
6. Alcohol: I did some alcohol since January 2021 1-2 beers in the evening everyday.

**Trying to come straight to point....**

I was doing fine before this weekend everything was fine and I had a pretty good life and felt clean as never and was a passionate meditation guy, beside working from home since a year which is heavily going on my mental health, I don't see a lot of people atm and not moving much which I need to improve soon.

Some friends came over this weekend and we did some molly and some adderall, but looks like thats not for meanymore. I did take too much from the Adderall and I was getting a panic attack and I knew that I took too much.

I felt in an emergency to take 1mg Lorazepam/Ativan (to become normal) and 5mg of Valium 6h later to sleep. Since then, I woke up I am having chest pain around my chest(5 days in a row). I went to the ER yesterday and I did a blood test and an EKG test which came back normal. 

I already had such feeling when I was coming of the benzos(squeezing in my heart) - because I was always googling my symptoms and I thought I had heart failure or coronary artery disease.

Now I am obsessed with the idea that I have the coronary artery disease. I went so often to my doctor due to the problems I have, which was anxiety(last 2 years), I am just waiting a few days to be sure that its not anxiety or so. I feel so ashamed to go to the doctor. 

I really wish and pray that its not something critical and that will go away, otherwise what's the point I mean all these efforts to suffer from anxiety again, I feel like game over like on those old consoles.

258,spaghetina,1614113759,"I've always had some amount of work anxiety (I'm an RN, although I work in a generally low-stress specialty), but it's been manageable. Lately, it's been off the charts. It probably doesn't help that I changed jobs twice last year and had to do a lot of relearning, but I'm finding myself at the point where I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack at any second. I had to go to the bathroom and talk myself off the ledge a couple weeks ago because I could feel control slipping away. Thankfully, taking those few minutes stopped it from becoming a full on tearful breakdown. I was in the middle of a surgical procedure this morning, thanking the heavens that I had a headband on for my mask, because I was in the midst of a flop sweat that I couldn't control. My hands have been shaking all morning, my heart pounding, and I generally feel like I want to run out of here and never come back. 

I was in the midst of making a doctor's appointment with my GP to figure out what could be done, but then I sat and thought about it, and I feel like there's no point. I can't take medication that could potentially impair my ability to function at work, and beyond that, I'm not sure what other solutions there are in the short term. I've never been to a therapist or done any cognitive behavioral therapy, but I can't imagine a diagnosis other than anxiety.

I'm not even quite sure why I'm posting except to see if maybe someone has been in a similar situation, and to see what solutions there might be from those who have experienced this. I don't want this to get to the point where I'm constantly calling out (which has happened before) because I can't bring myself to go in and suffer through all the anxiety for a full shift.

Honestly I can't tell if I'm lazy because I've been a procrastinator for long or cause of my anxiety and ocd. The thing is idk why I procrastinated when I was younger but in my highschool years, my anxiety has gotten worse and I am afraid to go out and interact with people and I think my depression/ennui stems from a lack of stimulation in my life. I just spend most of my days alone in my room. I want to do stuff but I get demotivated, the thing is the thought of putting effort into things dissaudes me. I think it has to do with how I overthink and make excuses not to do something. For example I am interested in art but the thought of drawing boring people and etc makes me not even want to pick up a pencil. I realize I have to do it eventually but it's so annoying when I want to create something but I need to learn x before I do y. I can like something but the moment it gets technical or its too difficult, I give up and quit. And thats why I enjoy games, they are difficult but it's so rewarding murdering people and its fun(FPS). I only like to do challenging stuff if it manages to keep my attention and its rewarding.

The traffic didn't get going. And with no exit in sight and being in the middle lane I had nowhere to go. I panicked and shitted myself. This was such a horrible experience. Ever since that moment I don't trust my body anymore. If I see a traffic jam sign I immediately get nervous. I don't like to be in situations where I can't leave, like a subway or being in a car with a colleague. Nobody knows this about me. Every day this controls my life. I couldn't carefree enjoy my own wedding. I worried about the drive to the hospital when my kids were born. I got severe panic attacks waiting in line for some event with my kids. I say no to cool activities like hiking and travelling. When I watch a movie I often think: ""I wish I could do that"" but immediately remind myself I can't do that because of my anxiety. Feeling nervous is my default state of mind. The link between feeling nervous and having the urge to poop is something I always had. But in the past I only got nervous from things everyone get nervous about. I never shitted myself again but in some occasions it was very close. I went to a psychologist, did cognitive therapy. Tried breathing techniques and meditation. Even tried to do EMDR. But it didn't help. I'm stuck.

I've been on a light dosage of Zoloft for about 6 months for generalized anxiety and find that it's only been slightly helpful. I still feel fairly anxious, it just doesn't tip over into panic. I haven't wanted to up the dose because I also feel a 'deadening' of the upside like joy, excitement, and motivation on the Zoloft too. I've been considering going off it entirely.

When I use marijuana, I find that I get 24-48 hours of 'spillover' reduction in anxiety even when I no longer actively feel the THC.

**WARNING** I’m going to describe it, if you get panic reading others experiences don’t read my post 

So a little back story. I am 34, female, and I’ve had generalized anxiety since I was 18. As many of you know it’s like a prison in your mind. I also suffer from panic attacks and they’re mostly triggered by crowds and grocery stores. I combat it by exposure therapy. I still can’t go inside a Walmart but I’ve been able to go everywhere else just fine. When I was 19 I suffered for about two years of extreme agoraphobia and I was terrified of driving. I was always worried about passing out and dying behind the wheel. I overcame it by driving *alot*

Flash forward to a half hour ago. I was driving out to my house. I live way out in the country and for about 15 minutes there’s no cell service. Suddenly I start being really conscientious of that fact. And what do you know...I notice my arms feel tingly. Next thing you know my mouth dries up and I realize that if I’m having a medical emergency no one will be able to call for me because there isn’t cell service. Hyperventilating begins. I feel faint. Nauseous. Heart pounding. I’m looking for a place to pull over safely so I can just succumb to my impending doom. 

Then it hits me. 

**THIS IS THE DRAGON THAT IS ANXIETY. THESE SYMPTOMS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE. THEY ARE NOT DANGEROUS** 

I tightly grip my steering wheel. I yell STOP IT. YOU ARE FINE. DO YOUR BREATHING. 

In my nose, out my mouth. In my nose. Out my mouth. 

Now I’m around the corner from my house. I brought my pulse down. I eased my breathing. I stopped my shaking. I faced it. And I refused to succumb to it. 

Sometimes. This is the bravest thing you can do when you suffer a panic attack. I dared myself to pass out, I dared myself to stop being scared. And it worked. My panic attack lasted about 4 minutes. The adrenaline dump was intense but I did it. Anyone else who has this understands how hard that is. And I just want to say, I’m really proud of myself.

Hello there,
My anixety started after my overdose in 2019 October. So it’s been quite a while now, my anxiety is much better now, I still do have my panic attacks time to time but I get through them much better than before.


I’m going out today in about 8 hours and this will be my first time properly going out in almost a year! Am I scared? Oh yes, I am scared sh*tless.

I am asking millions of questions of the things that might go wrong.  All the what ifs that’s going through, yes I knew this was coming up since 2 weeks ago but why am I still not ready?

Will they like me?
How do I talk to people? It’s been so long...
What if I’m late?
What if I get lost?
What if they don’t like the way I dress? Am I overdressed?
What if they don’t like how my perfume smells?
What if they don’t like my acne on my face?
What if they see the scars on my arms and hands?
What if my panic attack starts crawling up infront of them? 
What if I tap my fingers too much?


Yes... I am overthinking.. I know that nothing wrong is going to happen but if it does.. I feel like I am gonna go back to square one. BUT! I am going to stay strong and even if anything bad happens, it will only make me stronger.

I am active duty military and mental health is always scary. You have the risk of being discharged if you are seen as mentally unfit.
I tried seeing a chaplain, I've tried behavioral health counseling, and none of it worked. I have been wanting to try meds but everyone tells me how scary it is if they make things worse. Thankfully for me, I have the ability to basically be wavered to not deploy so I can have as much time to adjust to my meds as possible.
Seeing the therapist yesterday was amazing. I finally felt validated and heard. I've dealt with a lot of trauma growing up, such as my parents dying and living in an abusive foster home/ custody situation. The doc discussed that she believes I may have a trauma disorder and definitely have moderate anxiety. I have voiced the concern of possible paranoia to friends and am waiting to get the courage to discuss it with professionals.

I have never done something like this before but my anxiety/depression and ridiculous intrusive thoughts are overwhelming me. I need to vent to someone out there who may understand me! I constantly feel like everyone in my life is against me and that they don't love, value, and appreciate me. I am that one person who gives and gives and is willing to help whenever needed and I just get nothing in return from friends or family. I constantly compare my self to others and I compare the things I do for others(even the smallest gesture of thoughtfulness). And I get very upset and saddend when these things are not reciprocated. Also, I am so distant from my family because my thoughts are, why do I have to be the one always reaching out and inviting friends/family and I don't get that courtesy back. I completely feel left out and unappreciated. And in some ways, I feel like a child for having these feelings and I wish I can simply not take things so personal but I CAN'T! It bothers me so much, my brain and thoughts are on a repetitive cycle and I can't even sleep at nights. It may or it may NOT be a positive thing but I'm actually a very open minded and communicative person. My big mouth and ""speaking the truth"" and letting family/friends know how I feel and think completely BACKFIRES. People don't take well to criticism. I feel with this behavior, I push friends/family away. The only thing I want is to feel liked and  acknowledged. I feel alone and without any support from my real family, which hurts the most. Am I being over sensitive and dramatic? Is it better to just not say anything at all and keep emotions locked away? Because in the past I have expressed my emotions to family/friends thinking I could get a resolution or a change in that person but nothing ever changes. I'm getting tired of me constantly bringing up the exact same issues and feeling like I'm the one who is begging and begging for attention.  I usually put on a show of a personality of strength and independence but in reality I'm extremely sensitive and sad.

Growing up I was always the shy one. I barely spoke at all during classes but I tried to get along with everyone. This is how I’ve always lived. When I got social media, some of my classmates have suddenly unadded me (Snapchat), removed (Instagram) or even blocked on either. I’m quite a sensitive person and tend to spiral very easily so I take things like that very personally. I am in my final year of secondary school, this is the 3rd school I’ve been to throughout these 6 years. No matter where I am this keeps on happening to me and I just feel worse and worse about myself and my anxiety would go down with it. If you are in the UK you would know that 8/3 is when schools reopen. I am terrified to go back to say the least because I don’t know how people will see me and I am just trying to avoid school at this point (this happened in both previous schools). I know that no one can be perfect but it just isn’t a nice feeling to be the backup choice, especially since I’ve always been that person who is left out my whole life. I am miserable every day and am dreading when school reopens. I don’t know what I can do to help myself anymore...this academic year is very important because I’m in year 13 (equivalent to grade 12) which means I’m supposed to be taking public exams around April-June.

329,DerpVad3r,1614097672,"I'll try to keep this short. My industry is booming right now it's 5 times busier than our busy season (it's pretty much busy season all year round now). It became like this since COVID hit with the low interest rates.

I just started at this old company cause the previous one (I was only there for 2 months), and it was the first time I experienced full on panic attacks. I realized the only way to deal with it was to find a job at a larger company which would logically have a small workload. 3 months in and I'm realizing - no - it's not working. Yes, this company is big, but it's big to the point that everyone is applying for products at our company.

Since I began here I have been told:

* don't worry about the amount of emails you get - just tell them you're working on deals by closing date - doesn't matter when you receive the email (even if it's from weeks ago)
* don't take it to heart when our brokers complain about you - they will ALWAYS complain and they're extremely demanding
* even the senior staff are feeling the anxiety and stress of how insanely busy we are - a lot have taking short term/long term disability leave due to stress/anxiety
* some of my coworkers wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night panicking cause they think of work
* everyone does overtime now - no one remembers what it was like to have a weekend off. Working an additional 32 hours a week (includes weekends) is the norm.
* the director of our company has been trying to hire 6 additional teams (70 people) to lessen the workload for everyone. But people are quitting faster than they can hire.

I'm honestly trying my best to keep up in work. Even if I do overtime - I can never catch up. I've begun to try to accept the mentality that I don't NEED to do overtime as long as my deals in the upcoming week are dealt with. But each day I see my inbox climb 30-40 emails more than the day before. I'm beginning to lose sleep again over this, I wake up sweating and panicking about what awaits for me in my work inbox. So now I find myself contemplating, should I try to see if I can qualify for short term disability leave? I feel like i'm running away from my problems - cause I know the crazy workload will be waiting for me when I return from short term.

I don't know... I just wish I had some marketable skill where I could produce a product to sell... some kind of job where I'll be in control of some aspects of my day - some stability.

I’m a people pleaser who seeks constant validation from others and struggles to set boundaries. 

Over the last few months I’ve been in therapy because I’d been struggling with the decision of whether or not to continue in my long term relationship. I was very unhappy in the relationship but I had a complete and overwhelming fear that if I let him go I’d regret it forever or end up alone, or with someone worse. 

Therapy has been helping, and over the last few weeks for the first time in my life I’ve begun to recognise my patterns of negative thought as they were beginning and pull myself out of them. I’ve also recognised when I was craving validation from others and channeled that internally through self soothing and reinforcement. 

I think suddenly realising that my mental health is in my control rather than my emotions being something that controls me has somehow changed my whole outlook in a way I did not expect. 

Long story short, a few days ago I woke up with an intense sense of calm and clarity I’ve never felt before. For the first time ever I didn’t feel like I had to control everything around me (people’s perceptions of me, my certainty around my relationship, anything.) I felt completely calm in that the universe will take me wherever I’m meant to go. 

I ended my LTR that same day, and although I struggled to do so because I knew I was hurting him, after the fact I felt completely calm, if not relieved. I still feel complete relief. All the regret I was afraid I would feel has not eventuated.

I haven't been diagnosed with depression or social anxiety, although my twin brother has anxiety and my mum and dad both have depression. I was also diagnosed with Asperger's when I was 8, I have high functioning AS meaning I'm pretty capable. 

I currently have no friends and have had none for years live at my parents since I broke up with my gf of 6.5 years ago months ago. 

I just can't take my life anymore to the point where I'm never present in the moment and am unsure/worry about everything I do, I simply cannot relax and just have fun and let go. Whenever I chat to people I feel I must give of some sort of I'm not good enough vibe, probably lack self esteem too.

I have been thinking of moving to Bristol city centre in the UK where things are more thriving and living with housemates to try to make friends improve my social life and put my self in the deep end so to speak out of my comfort zone. Also better job prospects in Bristol.

Where I work people tend to like my and I have an easy going sort of vibe, but I struggle to form any bonds/connections. I am terriblely self-conscious.

I think because I come across as anxious, nice and serious people are ok with me but sense I'm uncomfortable and I make other people feel that way.

I basically just want to get rid of my self conscioussnes, become more confident/in the moment and improve my self esteem instead of doubting everything I do.

349,123space321,1614087460,"It feels like the worst part of my anxiety. The moment there are many factors to consider and no objective truth, I end up spiralling hard.

These are the reason option one is great. But these are the reasons it is a bad choice.

On the other hand, the other option has it's own pros and cons list.

And they are at odds. Fighting so fucking hard. My therapist talks about how anxiety can fuel a fire or cause paralysis by fear. This is the latter.

I get so tense I stand on the spot, fearing and hating and just being overwhelmed. I reach a point where I feel dirty and can't think of anything else but the thing on my mind. 

Except, it's not getting me closer to a solution. I don't know if it makes it harder to find a solution, but it certainly doesn't help. Any conviction I had in my previous thoughts are lost.

Safe option or risky option? Why do I feel the way I do? Will factors change in the future? Will I regret it?

and I wish I could say it happens only during big decisions, but it's true even when making tiny ones. Sure the effect is less severe, but the problem exists still.

She also says she thinks “it’s a load of rubbish” and “how will be be immune to it if we all get vaccinated?” I don’t know if she says these things to deflect and not because she doesn’t believe vaccines work.

This year has really taken a toll on my mental health. We worked from home last spring at the onset of COVID, and I loved it. But then we went back in-person in September and have been in-person ever since.

I'm struggling to figure out my next move. I'd love to have a fully remote job, but also wonder if that would have the inverse effect of making my mental health worse over time, because I could hole up at home and not challenge myself regularly, if that makes sense. At the same time, though, this year has been miserable in terms of my anxiety and depression - working through a pandemic, and feeling unappreciated at work, has been so hard.

Yesterday my school counselor called my mother and told her that they wanted to have a meeting with me, the vice principal, herself and my mother. When my mother told me about this yesterday I was really scared because I have toxic ass parents, and we already had a horrible fight yesterday. I really did nothing wrong, except an incident last week. I was really angry to my Englishs teacher and after quitting the lesson, I letted out my anger by just randomly talking to myself about all my problems, including the fact that I have toxic parents and self-harming. And the thing is, my mic was left open. It wasn't open when I first entered the lesson, and because of an error that I'm GLAD occured, my voice was coming sizzly so I'm not sure if they heard everything. It was Germany lesson and I only had a few friends and my Germany teacher in the classroom. She really doesn't cares, as much as I know (I don't know Germany, the teacher teachs the lesson in German and I have no idea what she talks about) and my friends that were in the lesson were laughing, that's why I don't think they heard something serious. Nothing else happened other than that, but still, I'm really stressed and had more than two anxiety attacks today, and a big one yesterday, after my fight with my parents.

It was still difficult, but it has got to the point now that I'm physically unable to do things. I want to puke from the idea of having to email someone, and I'm unable to sleep. My psychologist told me that I'm lonely and I should find something to do or someone to talk to, but I have been unable to find anywhere that accepts volunteer workers at the moment, and I haven't seen my friends in months. I don't even have anyone to talk to online. I wish I could just have casual phone calls during the day but there is nothing.

On top of the health anxiety, I have also been feeling like I'm just going crazy. I feel like the whole is unreal at time, and everything is spinning so much. Additionally, I remember things that might have been hallucinations and next I'm convinced that I'm becoming schizophrenic or something.

So I'm getting pretty bad work anxiety and it's getting worse, hence this post.

I have a lot of things going on in my life right now - who doesn't - and I feel like the atmosphere at work is one of the triggers.

When the sun goes down the night before (right now) I get an overwhelming feeling of work anxiety - dreading the following morning.

Usually the first few hours at work are pretty hairy - racing thoughts, unclear decision making and a heart rate of someone that's just done a marathon. It calms down eventually and then I can ride out the rest of work. But it is like this every. Single. Day.

The trigger is my boss. He's not a bad man but he is one of few words - even saying he likes fishing for the quiet and people annoy him. This is a new work industry for me so every 30 minutes I am saying things like 'what should I do next' 'what would you like me to do now' etc. and I feel like I am annoying him. I just want him to give me a list of jobs that will last the 8 hours at work.

I am new to this job and he hasn't tried to get to know me. So his comfortable silence is full of tension for me. Honestly the tension makes me stiffen up given we work 1-on-1 together and being all anxious I am on my tip toes ready for the next order. I spring into action worrying whether I did it quickly and efficiently enough every time.

I also hate getting up early. And this isn't because I love sleep. I mean I really love sleep. But I find early mornings so depressing. Honestly to me early mornings are the loneliest times on the planet. I hate that feeling

I am caught in the loop of anxiety making me tired and anxiety not allowing me to sleep. Making it very difficult to wake up for work the following early morning... I've already missed a couple of shifts and I have told a few lies to cover my anxiety tracks. But how do you make someone understand that your anxiety is the cause of it? It just feels like it isn't a good enough reason...

I also feel trapped. This job is my financial key to alot of what I want to achieve in the next few months so I HAVE to stay.

Sorry to go on but I've had this on my mind for weeks and I just had to get it out.

I am in the process of already looking for another job.",Anxiety,Overcoming work/early morning anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lqfjiz/overcoming_workearly_morning_anxiety/,1614048345.0

I am constantly thinking about the inevitably of my own death as well as the fact that I could pass away by random chance tomorrow.

Worse still is that since I was three I have had panic attacks cause by my hyperfocusing on what happens when you die. Its gotten to the point where I will punch the wall or biting on my fist to calm myself down.

I'd always thought that I just had a phobia of death but I think its either always been or evolved into an irrational paranoia revolving around my own death.

Honestly I don't even know if this is anxiety as I have never been officially diagnosed. My therapist says that I exhibited a lot of signs but I  don't know if that counts and honestly don't care. All I know is that this is and has been a constant problem and its eating away at me. It impedes my sleep, work and even just being alone with my own darn thoughts.

After about 3 or so years I stopped taking meds and my visits decreased because I was on top of my anxiety a lot more. 2 years ago i stopped seeing a psych altogether and felt like i was in a better headspace.

Fast forward to June last year and I was not doing ok. I was having regular anxiety attacks and was generally not feeling ok at all. I couldn't see anyone because everything was shut down because of covid and I felt like Id had enough.

Covid really made me think about a lot of things, one being my mental health and who I really am as a person. After putting if off for too long I'm finally biting the bullet and booking a drs appointment to get myself checked out. Im also putting my foot forward and requesting sick days because I've currently just been pushing it to the side so to speak.

So this has been happening to me for several years now and I still don’t know what the heck is going on. The weird thing is that it only happens in the winter when it’s snowing or raining and there’s slush and puddles all over the floor. I would start to notice all the little gross things around me (like the wet dirty tissues, gum, rust, dirty corners) and how gross the puddles are. 

In the back of my head I start to think if I were to touch that or consume that I would throw up. Then I would start feeling sick and panicky.

I was walking with my boyfriend today and suddenly I felt nauseous and like I couldn’t breathe. My entire legs started to itch and I noticed the musty fishy smell of the streets, I got super anxious and eventually broke down. I didn’t know why but I just felt super gross. I kept telling him that I needed to go home or else I’ll vomit. I wouldn’t touch anything and kept holding on to him tightly and I would get scared if a person gets near me.

I’m not sure if this is a symptom of OCD or something? Does anyone else go through this or have an explanation of why this happens to me?

Sometimes I’m walking in the city while the floors wet and have puddles I would start to feel disgusted and itchy everywhere.

I find that anxiety for me mostly manifests in overthinking particularly about my own actions and words. For example after work I will replay what I said to people and anaylse whether it was inappropriate, could they have been offended, will I be in trouble the next day? Etc etc. 

It happens after seeing friends, going on dates etc too. I usually pick something I said aswell and form a whole conspiracy about how it’s going to get misconstrued or get me in trouble and I really suffer because of this. I like to think of it as my anxiety bullying me haha. 

Just wondering if anyone can relate or has tactics to help deal with this. My anxiety is manageable for the most part although I am considering therapy and medication as it is getting worse.

Okay, so my(22m) girlfriend(21f) suffers from anxiety for about 80% of her day. There isn't really a way to quantify it for her or for her to explain it to me. She did suffer some trauma in her earlier childhood and that certainly feeds into her desire to be busy all the time. She can't sit still or relax because her anxiety spikes and she feels guilty for not studying or moving towards her next goal. My question is, as a loving boyfriend, what can I do to help comfort her and ease her mind? I just want her to feel safe and loved.

432,Annabellepatato,1614057007,"So basically, my mom had been married to my stepdad for about 2 years, (I was 14, I’m 16 now) and what can I say, he makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I get the worst anxiety just hearing his voice or his footsteps, I don’t know why it is, I’ve had past father figures who were pretty bad too.

One man my mom dated for about 4 years, who we lived with, turned out to be a pervert/pedophile (he had teen p*rn on his laptop) although he never did anything to me. Then my mom married a guy who was extremely verbally abusive, we actually had to evacuate the house in the middle of the night because he threatened to kill us. 

And then my mom dated this guy for almost a year, who was just kind of a jerk and sort of verbally abusive, although not as much as the other.

But let’s talk about my current stepdad. I genuinely feel nauseous around him, it’s almost as if he had sexually assaulted me or something, but he didn’t. He is super over controlling, and he gets really mad that I don’t like to say hi or good morning to him when I enter a room. He also gets mad when I am just sitting on the couch watching tv or something with my mom, because he has this mentality that we should always be up doing stuff rather than sitting around.

He has these really disgusting habits, like he walks around the house with only underwear and tennis shoes on. And it seriously grosses me out, one time I remembered he had a wet spot on his crotch which made it obviously look like he pissed himself. And he was just walking around like that, I was so uncomfortable and I ended up telling my mom about it when she was in my room later but she just told me it was because he splashed water on himself while washing the dogs. 

Not only does that bother me though, I go out of my way to avoid him. If I come out of my room and he is in the kitchen, I instantly regret coming out. 

When I hear my phone buzz because I got a text, I brace myself to see if it was a text from him. When I’m literally just chilling in my room all happy, I will get super upset and stressed if I hear his voice in the kitchen. 

I have had so many awkward and uncomfortable dreams about this man, I can’t even talk about them because they make me feels so uncomfortable. 

Maybe part of the reason I hate him so much is because he’s the reason my brother moved away. My stepdad is an extremely ignorant conservative man, and my brother is sort of the opposite. He tried his best to change my brother. I remember around the first week my mom had met him, he (my stepdad) was at my house at the time to take me to school while my mom and brother weren’t home, and he walked into my brothers room and put all this trash and belongings on his bed to try and prove a point about something I don’t remember what it was.

He bullied my brother constantly to the point he literally flew away to another state as soon as he turned 18. And he is sorta doing the same to me, he constantly talks shit about random people he doesn’t even know. Like, he owns a Real state company, and when he has a client who has an accent, or is poor or anything like that, he makes fun of them behind their back.

He has literally defended black face and slavery. This stuff really bothers me. I hate the fact that I live with this disgusting pig. And when I express my feeling to my mom she gets mad at me. I literally broke down crying to her about this and she just got mad at me. 

And she hates him too, it’s like she is only with him because he’s stupid rich and we were poor before he came into our lives and “saved us”. He thinks he’s like our savior or something, he is CONSTANTLY reminding us that before he came into our lives we were living in a rental house and could barely pay for groceries.

I don’t even care. I’d go back to that, I hate the fact that I don’t even wanna leave my room or wake up in the mornings because of this man. I’m straight but he has literally made me wish I was lesbian, he has made me have such a hatred for men. I know that some of my past father figures probably caused that as well, but he’s the icing on the cake. I can’t stand him. Sometimes I even wish he’d just die, I know that’s wrong but I can’t help it.

He’s also the only man my mom has ever been with that has told me about him and my mother’s sexual interactions. 

I remember he was driving me to school one day, like a few months into their relationship before they were married, telling me about how he was annoyed with my mom because she didn’t wanna have sex with him before they were married.

A few months ago he was telling me about how he’s upset that my mom isn’t romantic enough with him, and how they have sex but he doesn’t feel it’s enough or something. 

And he’s talked to me about this stuff a lot, like he’s upset that my mom doesn’t get close to him at night under the covers, and he’s upset that she doesn’t cuddle him enough or something.

Why does he have to talk to his stepdaughter about this though?

Maybe he also creeps me out because he’s the only man my moms ever been with that constantly tells me that I smell good and look pretty. Like I feel like every time I’m around him he says something like “wow you look amazing whatever you are doing to lose weight is working” 

“Wow you smell so good Annabelle you always smell so good what are you wearing”

I will never forget, right as my mom started dating him a few years ago, he CONSTANTLY talked about my body. It made me sooo uncomfortable. I remember telling my mom that at the time, and she told him to stop doing that because I didn’t like it. 

But when she wasn’t around he would say something like “I know I’m not allowed to say this stuff but I can’t help it, you are loosing so much weight wow I am amazed you look so good”

And he is always pointing out other girls and young girls clothing choices. I remember we were at the grocery store, and he pointed to like this girl who looked to be around the age of 12 and say “if you ever wear shorts that short I will kill you”

He caused my mom to have panic attacks EVERY DAY because he can’t leave her alone. He bothers her about everything, he doesn’t like it if she doesn’t go to bed at the same time he does, he doesn’t like it if she talks about certain things, he doesn’t like it if my mom has something of hers in the living room like her jacket or shoes, etc. 

Also, on a daily basis he brings up my moms past relationships and uses them against her, but if she says ANYTHING mentioning them he throws a fit. She could say something like “oh yeah well back in 2013 when I was with so and so” and he will get so pissy and I can’t even explain it.

He got into an hour long argument with my mom all because I ate all the saltine crackers, he just couldn’t let it go. If my mom doesn’t say hi to one of his friends when he runs into them or something, he gets so mad and doesn’t stop bothering her about how mad he is about it for a whole day.

He gets mad at me because I walk slowly, and because I lay down on the couch in the mornings, and because I talk quietly, and because I don’t acknowledge him enough. It’s like he’s obsessed with me. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t wanna be around him at all. 

I stay in my bedroom most of the afternoons when he’s home from work, and I won’t leave to get food or anything until he’s gone or in bed. If I’m in the kitchen getting food or something, and he walks in, I almost feel like crying because I just feel like he’s gonna do something bad to me. I sometimes don’t even wanna eat the food he cooks because I’m nauseous at the thought of eating or touching something he’s touched.

When he walks near me, I really panic I can literally feel my heart rate rising. And I think it’s because the only time he ever talks to me is when he’s scolding me or telling me I need to do something.

I can even say specifics, I’d say these past too weeks these are the interactions we’ve had. 

“Annabelle, last night I saw you close the refrigerator door with your foot, don’t do that it ruins the fridge” 

“Don’t put your used Kleenexes on the table, put them in this tissue box” 

“What’s your problem Annabelle” he asked me that in the middle of the store because I didn’t wanna go to another store bla bla bla doesn’t matter 

“GOOD MORNING” he screamed at me (not in a playful way btw) because I didn’t say good morning when I walked into the room first thing in the morning

“Annabelle did you take your medicine yet? I know you don’t realize it but your not yourself when you aren’t on your meds”

“Wow Annabelle you ate a while sleeve of saltines in one night” this is what led to that super long argument with him and my mom.

I’ve been writing this thing for like a good hour and I should go to sleep now. But yeah, I’ve actually been so depressed lately. I don’t wanna leave my bed or talk to anyone, not even my mom. I can barely even speak, and I can’t look at him when he’s in a room. If I see him in his stupid underwear , it affects me for the whole night, it’s so violating to me and I don’t know why.

I mainly just wanted to rant about this, but it would be really nice if I can get some feedback or something so I don’t feel so alone about this.

2/22/21

My mental health began its rapid decline a year ago, after an emotional hiccup in my life. Neuroticism possessed me. I became irritable, depressed, insecure, sad and sick. Hypochondria crept into my daily routine, as a trip to the gym triggered a panic attack that rendered me terrified of exercise. Suddenly i was afraid of every unfamiliar sensation on my body. I was existing in a constant state of fear and discomfort, and it seemed I was headed towards Agoraphobia.

It's been several months, and without medication; I can proudly say that just by learning about anxiety, I have begun to face it head on. I began to reassure myself that I wouldn't be defeated, and I began to prevail. I am back in the gym every morning at 7:00, I am eating well, and pursuing my interests. Nonetheless, there is a residual darkness that looms, reminding me that I'm still afflicted.

The Good Days:

On my good days, I am optimistic, sociable, confident, inspired and usually excited for the challenges I set up for myself. The ones that are supposed to turn my life around, and get me on the right track. I start to get into the groove, and things begin to look up. I stick to my routine, I coast through the day, and I am focused on myself. Im not manic during these periods, just really hope-full and determined. Life has meaning and my eyes are on it. This could last a week, two weeks, or even three.

The Bad Days:

Suddenly, It's like a switch is flipped, and I become my shadow. Like a veil is draped over me. I am irritable, over-stimulated, distracted, and unwell. I don't really have concerning thoughts, besides intrusive ones that accompany anxiety. Every new sensation on my body is a symptom of a deadly disease I didn't know I had. I begin to believe i'm going crazy, and theres multiple moments where I literally say to myself ""welp... here I go... this is it"", and am thoroughly convinced that the following moments I will have left this realm and entered insanity. It's bloody terrifying. I don't want to hurt myself. Im not particularly sad or depressed. I just simply feel unwell, and all the qualities that embody me on my good days are muffled and blurred. I feel hazy. The good habits I was so excited to implement, suddenly cease, and I don't even realize until its been a few days since I have stayed consistent. Its so annoying. The smallest things make me uncomfortable or paranoid, and my world exists inside my head, not in reality. I am not present, not myself, and feel susceptible to malevolence. Regardless, I do my best to stick with my routine, as if its another good day.

The Aha! moment:

After a week or so of trudging through the mud, I suddenly realize that I have the conscious ability to get my life on track. What an epiphany. I become excited about all the minor changes that seem so accessible. How silly was I this whole time. My interests start to beckon before me, and I begin to work towards them. My routine begins to feel more sound, and its on its way to becoming a full fledged habit. I am active. I read. I write. I eat on schedule, and I exist outside of my head and my phone. Im so excited. The tunnel is getting brighter and brighter, and standing at the end is my ideal self. It's been a week and a half, and things feel so good that my journal entries are filled with affirmation. ""Finally the fog is lifting"".

And then the switch flips.

Im not sure if theres a trigger. Im not sure if it takes 1 bad day to ruin the next couple weeks. All I know is that my mental health seems to be operating on a cycle, and it has been for the last several months. I can say that I've made plenty of progress since last year. I am more level headed, more durable and more equipped....but Im damn tired. And I know theres a lot of you out there that are too. At times I have felt frustrated, because any time I try to explain this stuff to people I feel like they don't really know what Im saying. Like it doesn't really make any sense.

Anyway I hope some of you find this post valuable. At least to know theres one more person out there that knows how you may feel. Any wisdom is welcome.

So, my anxiety came back after 7 years worry and attack free. Oh man, I mean I thought I had it beaten. It was paradise. I was on top of everything, had a ""You can get better"" attitude, was so chill all the time. I was content. 

Well, holy fuck did it come back with a HAMMER. 

The fatigue and the shakes that come with it are KILLING me. ""The Fear"" as I call it...it grips me HARD when my legs start feeling too weak to walk on. I get out of breath going up steps. Muscle cramps in my back. My sinuses feel like just the top half of my jaw is gonna blow or something sometimes. I'm 32.

I'm a fitness guy. I leg press 525lbs x10 for 4 sets at least once a week. When I feel strong, I feel *strong*. I do full upper body stuff, lower body stuff. 

But for the last two days I had a headache, my neck seized up, I got so weak I could just sit on all 4's and breathe. I cried.  I took ibuprofen for the headache and got so weak I couldn't get off the couch without breathing hard. Today a muscle on the left side of my neck is tender to the touch and I'm crazy tired. Recently had a physical and everything was Green except high triglycerides and high blood pressure because, yep, anxious about being there.

I also suffer from dermatillomania (which seems to rise and fall in tandem with the severity of my GAD). In the past four years, I went off SSRIs and all medication, save for the ~very occasional~ benzo. I have had prescriptions for them in the past, but not currently—when I moved states my new primary care provider told me that they do not allow any of their patients to be taking any benzo of ANY kind unless they are actively weaning off it. 

Since the pandemic began, my anxiety has SKYROCKETED. I also experienced a breach of trust in my relationship with my live in girlfriend. Suddenly whatever stability I had cobbled together in the last four years is gone. Sometimes my anxiety spirals get so bad I throw up, or they last for days. I have a few benzos stashed away, and sometimes they’re the ONLY thing that makes me feel like a normal person again. 

I have good habits: I gratitude journal, deep breathe, etc. I try my very hardest to maintain my anxiety during the day, but when I slip into a crisis benzos seem like the only thing that will help. I know that the culture surrounding them in the medical establishment seems to have shifted. Is it even worth trying to get a prescription for them? Will it even be possible?

477,idktbh567,1614042861,"I'm 18 and I've had a very bad fear of throwing up ever since I was little. Even though I've rarely ever vomited in my life. 

Overall I've gotten sick around 4 or 5 times in my life and they took place in my childhood. I remember each time but the last time I got sick is the event that I can link back to the root of my fear.

I was around 8 or 9 and I was sick one Christmas. I remember I was given medicine to take but I hated thr medicine cause it was disgusting. I started crying  and my mam was gonna give me the medicine and I remember she was getting angry because I was complaining about it. I don't think she understood how sick I felt at the time because moments later I was gettin sick all over the floor. My mam cleaned it up and that was that.

Ever since that day I've had an intense fear of vomiting. I used to get panic attacks and my dad would have to calm me down. I hated goin on bus rides with the schools incase I threw up. It didn't completely take over my life but it was bad when the anxiety struck me.

It wasn't until around 15 and 16 when the fear settled and I didn't think about it alot. I was anxiety free for most of a year. I drank alcohol with no worries, smoked weed with no worries, went on bus rides, 

But when I turned 17, everything changed for the worst 

I found that nearly every few days I would get small panic attacks thinking I was gonna get sick. This kept goin and on and when lockdown hit due to covid it only got worse. Eventually it was every night I was panicking in my bed thinking ""what IF I get sick"". I had to listen to meditation videos to calm me. It consumed my life, i wouldn't smoke weed or drink alcohol incase they'd make me sick. 

Over time the fear did subside, I could drink as much alcohol as I wanted without being afraid, I smoked without being afraid,. But the fear is nvr gone. 

A couple months ago I was drinking on Christmas and I had drank way to much and I ended up grttin sick that night. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 10 YEARS I ACTUALLY GOT SICK. I was drunk while I got sick so I wasn't afraid or disgusted. In fact right after it happened I felt extreme happiness and I was actually excited! It wasn't as bad as I thought and I actually got sick and survived it in fact I felt better. 

That happiness was short lived as when I sobered up I was very anxious and now I am afraid to drink that much alcohol again in case I vomit.",Anxiety,I have emetophobia and it gives me intense anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lq5ee6/i_have_emetophobia_and_it_gives_me_intense_anxiety/,1614014061.0

I noticed it a few times when they pushed me in physical therapy but went to the gym today for the first time in a long time and as my anxiety has worsened over the last year I have done everything I can to keep my heart rate low to help stave off attacks.

Anyways, I lived most of my life without feeling much. As in, while I was capable of feeling, I lacked for example the capacity of putting myself in other person's shoes. It is still hard for me to do it. I feel like when I ""show empathy"" more than putting myself in a different position is more like making a judgement based on how a situation would normally affect someone. Maybe I always got the meaning and how empathy works wrong, but I always felt like I was doing something wrong when I did it. This whole thing really stresses me out, because the few people I actually care about are way out of my reach when it comes to helping in an emotionally impactful situation. This by itself is bad but recently it got worse. Mainly because I met someone who actually makes me feel. She is by far the person I love the most in my life, and just her presence makes me feel you know... normal. Having said that, I can't deal with all these emotions. I'm not just talking about being in love with her. I mean everything. I can't deal with these. I'm not used to really feel, let alone feel so much and so intensely. When I get hurt (emotionally) I cry. Before I knew her I was starting to believe that I was incapable of crying. The closest I've come to was finding my dog's corpse on the side of the road after not checking if the gate was closed. He used to run away a lot so I checked everyday if my parents closed it. The one day I didn't check was the day that happened. I felt horrible. That dog was my emotional support. When I got angry, sad, depressed that dog would cheer me up. Even then I didn't shed a single tear. Now I've became a cry baby. Literally if she says that she will go away I will start to cry. I am terrified of that possibility, but at the same time I feel like the fact that she loves me too is too good to be true and so I constantly make excuses trying to justify how she acts towards me. To my luck she is very and I mean VERY patient with me. Honestly even I get tired of me making those excuses so it amazes me how she is able to listen to all of them, assure me that I shouldn't be afraid and tell me that she loves me, god knows how many times and lots about the same problem. However even with all these I still can't really actually tell how she feels. I say that in the sense of really being able to never doubt her feelings. It doesn't help that she thinks she is the problem, because of something that happened in her past. And to make things better, not being able to fully accept her love makes me think that she'll go away if I don't fix this. That may not even be a possibility, but I'm so scared that it happens, but the more I think about that, the more desperate I get and more pressure put I on myself, which doesn't help at all and makes everything worse.

Well, now that I look at this, it's a lot bigger than I intended. And also a lot more confusing, even I don't know what I am talking about at the end of this. Once again, I'm sorry for ranting about... even I don't know what. If anyone could give me some advice or even just give their opinion on the matter I would really appreciate ir.

I've been having a weird problem for the last 5 or so months where I get these weird electric shock type sensations beginning in my forehead and travelling down my body - they make me feel very unbalanced and dizzy briefly and are unpleasant. I get them a few times a week randomly, but when I go for a run I often get them over and over repeatedly. Other exercise like cycling I don't get them as much.

From what I've read they are usually associated with withdrawing from SSRI meds.

I've experienced GAD like anxiety for the past few years and currently take sertraline 100mg (think zoloft in the US, a SSRI).

I've mentioned the zaps to the doctor, they think it isn't med related and did some blood pressure and blood tests (iron, vit D etc), but they all came back fine. 

I'm not sure if it's just a new anxiety thing... I do get dizzy but I've never felt like this before. Also, I'm in general not very stressed at the moment. And when it happens most - running - I'm not anxious. 

The other confusing factor is that the other week I forgot to take my medication just one day. I've never done this before. I had similar brain zaps in the late afternoon, which got better when I took half my next dose early (I realised I'd missed a dose). So either it feels exactly the same, or it is the same thing. But then why would I get it running?!

A bit of background:

Anyway I feel like I’ve been living in denial for years now, I’ve always had trouble staying consistent with things, would get a sinking feeling when I have to do any mundane task, such as going to the bank/store or socialize (even though I love it). And this has culminated now during lockdown where my anxiety has incapacitated me and I can’t do but the bare minimum for existence. 

For example I have to apply for masters because I want to continue my education, but... I just can’t... Like there’s something that just tells me “you wont get accepted”, “you’re missing some prerequisites”, “you won’t have money to pay it off” and so on, as a result I’ve been putting it off for months now. This has made me completely depressed and life just sucks now, nothing is enjoyable anymore. And I’m fucking sick of this shit and I hate it, I just want to do normal things like a normal person. So, I’m going to therapy for the first time tomorrow and am really excited.


But at the same time I also feel like I’m over exaggerating. I’m slightly tired, so now I’m thinking to myself wether I’m just being dramatic and I’ll feel fine tomorrow. Did anyone else feel like this? I’m very confused right now and have no idea what to think, but regardless I’m going to a psychiatrist tomorrow. Did anyone else feel like this?

507,fifthavenuelion,1614035209,"Hello everyone.

I got my first panick attack last July at the end of a very stressful week and ever since then I've been dealing with all sorts of psychical sensations such as back pain (upper part), tingling, muscle twitches/spasms (on literally every part of my body, it's not one sided), lightheadedness, stiff neck, headaches (tension like, mostly around the temples and forehead), nausea, bloating, chills, shooting pains, and even speech problems (messing up words and making long pauses when speaking).  Although I haven't had a CT scan or MRI done, I've seen specialists who think there's isn't an underlying health issue, causing these symptoms. This gave me reassurance but it wasn't long until the thought that I had some serious desease (you guessed right - MS or a brain tumor) came back to my mind. I guess it's hard for me to accept the fact that anxiety alone can be the cause of these unpleasant sensations. 

Although I've only had 2 full-blown panic attacks since last summer and lately I've been doing my best to banish every bad thought that tries to settle in my mind, I still experience random symptoms almost every day even when I don't feel stressed or pressured (let alone having an attack). Is this common for anxiety sufferers, can the sensations linger for such long period of time? And what are yours?  
I try my best to ignore them but they don't give up on reminding me about their existence (especially when I'm alone). So I'm probably in some vicious circle (I think I'm not anxious but subconsciously I am, mainly because of these pains?). I'm starting to ramble. Sorry!

P.S. I'm also tempted to ask the stupid question ""what do you think is the chance of me having a tumor with these symptoms (which have been with me for the last 7 months already)"". But I'm not.

I had him unadded/blocked most of the 2 years because I didn't want to see him move on with other girls but recently i added him back and he messaged me and after i told him about me moving to spain and ""miss you!"" he said ""ahaha thats cool good luck, i miss you too, i wish we gonna meet again at some point."" then convo ended.

Then like 3 weeks later he invited me to like his software company page, it was new so i assume he invited other friends as well. I accepted the like request. Then a couple days after that i updated my profile pic and he liked it which stood out to me because he rarely likes my stuff. To the thing im asking about, today i commented on a guy friends facebook picture fire emojis and his page is public so it goes on my news feed for all friends to see. Like 20-30 minutes after i did that, the guy in question comments on this meme picture and tags one of his girl friends. Now the only reason i'm even asking about that is because he barely uses facebook like that, i know this because i follow him on facebook and nothing ever comes up about him. So I was thinking maybe he was copying me.

523,anonymousaccxuser,1614032830,"Hi. If you’re reading this, don’t feel at all pressured to respond, I am only venting.
PS. The examples mentioned are situations that have happened before the pandemic. 

So, I’m a teen in year 10, a year away from doing my GCSE’s, and about a year ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

There are some people who complain about wearing face masks, but for me, I don’t only wear them for the purpose of protection, but also to hide my face. I have become a very insecure teen, due to being bullied for several years about certain things. I do not like others seeing me, at all. 

In school, we have group projects, presentations, debates, discussions, ect...
all of this involves interacting, so I try not to participate, but it’s difficult when teachers don’t pay attention...

I have talked to several of my teachers during my lessons, explaining my anxiety issues to them and that because of my anxiety I cannot do the task I have been asked to do, for example speaking in-front of my whole class.
But no, this was in no way helpful, at all...

In one of my classes, my teacher began reading out all of the students’ grades for a test we had just taken, now, I know that some of my peers probably felt the same way, but I had walked up to my teacher, crying, asking them not to read out mine, as that class is very judgmental and always laughs at low grades - which, may I say, the teacher does nothing about, to try and prevent this toxic behaviour - and that it’ll only make me extremely anxious, but of course... my request was disregarded, my feelings were invalidated and I sat down, having a panic attack after my grade was read out loud, after I had specifically asked for it not to be, politely.

In another class, my other teacher asked us all to perform a scene in a play we were learning about, I began shaking, sweating and felt as though I could not get up out of my chair, so I just sat there, staring at the teacher, mouthing to them ‘please, don’t make me do this...’ but again, my request was disregarded, my feelings were invalidated and yes, I had a panic attack after the teacher had threatened me, by saying that If I do not perform, they will give me the ‘lowest’ mark. 

Even though I have a lot of other examples, this will be my last one... I was in a class and the teacher asked me a question, I froze, I didn’t know the answer, and whenever I don’t know the correct answer, I feel as if I will be judged or thought of as ‘stupid’. I started tearing up and just sat there, still frozen. The teacher then began giving a whole lecture to the class about ‘some individuals’ will fail their GCSE’s, if they don’t participate or try hard enough, pretty sure this was indirectly aimed at me, so now, even though I feel extremely self conscious and judged for it, I’ve started saying ‘I don’t know’, or ‘I’m not sure’, as they’ve requested and guess what... still isn’t good enough... 
‘...no, I need an actual answer, “I don’t know” will not be accepted’. 

I know a lot of people have dreaded online school, but in all honesty, I loved it, I could get away with not knowing or not wanting to answer due to my anxiety, and felt a lot less anxious. 

Today, I have found out that my school will be reopening on the 8th of March. I am writing this all on the 22nd of February, that means I have exactly two weeks left, until all that anxiety comes rushing back. It has stressed me out to the point where, I have been bawling my eyes out for quite some time. I calm down after a few minutes, and there I go again... uncontrollably crying until I feel numb.

My anxiety and depression all came to be because of school, in general, but also because of all the toxicity in that environment.

Sometimes, when my anxiety becomes very intense, I tend to skip school, I’d lie and make up excuses, the lengths I’d go to, to skip school is quite worrying.",Anxiety,Teachers Don’t Get It,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lq1v2r/teachers_dont_get_it/,1614004030.0

I’ve been feeling this way for like 3 weeks but there was a point where i forgot about it for a few days and felt fine (at least if I’m remembering correctly). But the more I freak out the more my mind hands me “depressing thoughts” like “do you really want to live?” “What do you think is the meaning of life?” And things around that. Like I saw a tiktok and an old man was playing guitar (shredding btw) and I told myself “when I’m that old it’ll feel like there’s no point of life” which that made me feel like I’m becoming depressed and freaked me out. Now I can’t get these “depressing thoughts” away. I told myself why I want to experience life and there’s a TON of goals I have.

I've worked very hard in therapy over the years, and am much different than who I used to be. I continue to work at it. But I will always be the scapegoat of my family. I see that will never change. I had hopes, though. But they still treat me like they always have, despite the fact I've changed. I think I'm too old to see any change from them at this point. 

I hadn't seen an ex-wife of a family member for many years. She was at a family function recently. Instead of having normal conversation, she actually told an extremely embarrassing story of something I did when I was 1 year old. I had never even heard this story before. She told the story in front of about 10 other family members, who listened intently. By some small miracle, I laughed along, and actually shared another embarrassing story I did when I was little. I shared it in a way not to self-deprecate, but in a subtle way of ""F\*ck you, I'll top that."" I forget how my therapist explained what I did, but he was very happy that I did it.   


Her telling the story just perpetuated my lifelong feeling of ""My family has pegged me as the crazy one, even since I was as young as 1 years old. No matter who I am today, they will never change what they think of me, or what they tell others about what they think of me."" It's beyond depressing. I just can't get to the point of ""F\*ck them, I don't care what they think"" because--well--it's family. The stigma of depression and anxiety run so deep, even in this day and age, where you'd think people would get it by now. 

I'd love it if you could share stories about your supportive family or friends. I can at least soak in some happiness vicariously and be happy for those whose family and friends get it.

So this has been happening more and more frequently lately and I don’t know why. I have a perfectly happy life. I love my family, I have an amazing best friend. I take a few classes which I find a lot of fun, and I’m not at all super stressed, but recently, I’ve started to completely break down with these stupid panic attack things to the slightest bit of stress. The other day at one of my classes, my teacher was doing some one-on-one time with me and my partner on a paper we had to write and present. Me and my partner had the paper formatted in a way that he would present one half, and I would present the other. While I presented my half, I kind of fumbled at some of the words and panicked, and sort of rushed the ending a little and simplified it so my parter could finish his half. The whole time while he was presenting I was trying to pull myself together but I couldn’t, and silent cried and did the stupid shuddery gaspy thing and the whole time my teacher and my partner was just trying not to notice while my parter tried to finish his side of the presentation. Luckily when we were done my teacher pulled me away and he was supper supportive and I was able to calm down.

561,sadoozy,1614025991,"I feel like anxiety in itself is an isolating condition. It traps you in your head and essentially convinces you that all of your problems are life or death situations. It succeeds in doing this by also convincing you that you are the only one who is going through this and you are crazy and not normal and you’re just a defect of a person. You think ‘ugh god why is this happening why can’t I just be normal why does everything have to make me feel like I want to die’. 

The truth is you are not the only one though. ALL of us here are struggling in our own way and yet most of us are probably thinking the same thing, that we’re alone. It couldn’t be further from the truth. You are not  alone, you are not crazy, you are not a defect, you are a human being that is strong and capable of dealing with a lot. I like to think that those of us who suffer from anxiety are the strongest of all, we have to deal with our brain trying to kill us every day!!  

If you ever feel like you are alone, do your best to reach out to someone, anyone, even strangers here on the internet. You’ll be surprised to find the amount of people who truly care about you and will do their best to make you feel seen and heard. I know how difficult that can be for many people myself included, but it’s an important first step on the road to recovery.

It should, according to Apple Help, be in or near my car, which was in the garage when I dialed it. I thought I forgot it at home. I came home and it took longer than usual, but it synced with car once when I turned the engine on. I dialed it from the dashboard. It rang and then went to voicemail, it was on silent. I looked once, pretty throughly, but I couldn’t  find it. Then, Apple Help thinks the battery died, it started going straight to voicemail and could not be dialed from the car. 

Despite the fact that it should logically be there. The fact I bought the lost and stolen AppleCare, because I did lost a phone a long time ago. The fact that once I was using a backpack with bad zippers and a phone was lost in the back of the car for several days.  I am afraid to look for it.

568,FauxDodo,1614024424,"Like most anxiety-sufferers my age (30), I grew up during a time when juvenile or adolescent anxiety and depression were not really considered legitimate issues. Instead, we were ""fraidy-cats"", ""worry-warts"", ""sensitive plants"", ""whiners"", ""cry-babies"", ""wusses"", etc. Our problems were seen as the result of us (or our parents) having sub-par personalities, the manifestations of our fear seen as bad behavior. As a result, I (and probably countless others) was punished and ridiculed for it, by the adults around me and by my peers.  I was constantly asked *why* I was afraid of the dark, or *what was wrong with me* that I didn't want to swim in the deep end of the pool or go white-water rafting, or how it was possible that I hated roller coasters. To me it was obvious (because I might die, you morons!), but to society at large, not ""shutting down"" that overwhelming self-preservation instinct was a character flaw. ""Don't be such a fraidy-cat,"" was the constant refrain of my childhood, despite the fact that it never once succeeded in curing me of my fear. Unsurprisingly, it made it worse. I began to see fear as a shameful thing, something that must be hidden. To this day, whenever I feel nervous or afraid, I feel shame come rushing in on its heels almost immediately. I still feel the need to shake off the label of ""fraidy-cat"", because it translates to ""you will be punished for this"". 

As antiquated as I want to think this attitude is, I still see it represented everywhere, from kids' movies to commercials to ""motivational"" speeches by professors to their students or by bosses to their employees. Even some supposedly therapeutic practices have been infected by it (""confront your fears, you pussy!""). The message is clear: ""This is no country for fraidy-cats---blessed are the outwardly courageous."" I don't know if it's a trickle-down effect of the patriarchy (fear is weak and therefore feminine) or some form of geographical psychology (the ""pioneer"" spirit) particular to the US, but it is NOT helpful, and I for one am still dealing with the fallout.

569,HaveYouNoShameLOL,1614024273,"I'm assuming the answer is going to be ""yes"", but has anyone else experienced *severe* fever induced anxiety before?

It happened more-so when I was *much* younger, and has happened... Maybe once in my 20's, so it's been a few years.

Basically typically when I'm sick and would have a fever, I'd wake up and just... Be freaking the fuck out. I mean full blown panicking. I'd have to get up and pace, If I tried laying back down I'd constantly jump up and just start *kinda* hyperventilating. 

But the weirdest part? I'd have the ***strangest*** thoughts. My mind would be racing over numbers. How BIG some numbers were, and if I had to reach those numbers it would take forever, or how long years were, and... Ugh it's so hard to explain, and I know how confusing it sounds because trust me, It's confusing to me too. Another time, maybe when I was 10-ish I remember waking up thinking tidal waves were coming to get me. I kept leaping out of bed, and drinking water, scared shitless and just freaking out.

I would get this weird feeling in my chest, like existential doom and it won't go away. Like *literal physical feelings of anxiety*.

Has anyone else experienced this? NONE of my doctors (None of them psychologists/psychiatrists) ever gave me an answer I felt meant anything. I don't think I have a problem or anything, it'd just be nice to hear if anyone else experienced this before as well.

I can have a massive panic attack if my mind spirals down into a hole and when that happens, only ativan works to calm my body down. I have done some mindfulness work, and meditation has worked to calm myself in these situations, at least initially, and now CBD has been a lifesaver when I start to get into a panic mode. 

I often get panicked when I think about heart issues, and when I eat, as I have heart disease in the family. 

This all started five years ago, I was drinking and using a lot of cocaine, as well as working out really heavily, and my body just stopped on me. I experienced adrenal fatigue and couldn't get out of bed for two weeks. I almost became agoraphobic, had a hard time going outside, as it was very noisy and overwhelmed my senses. 

I went to the hospital five times thinking I was having a heart attack or allergic reaction, but they were all massive panic attacks. I changed everything, stopped drinking, smoking doing drugs, took caffeine and sugar out of my diet. 

I got better over the course of four to five years, to where I could exercise again, as well as drink coffee, and I was feeling very good. And then my mother in law had a heart attack and died and I started to experience really bad panic attacks again, couldn't exercise, or drink coffee, or do much. 

It has been a year and a half since she has passed, and I can do some small exercise again, as well as have the odd cup of tea without experiencing really bad anxiety, and I am considering therapy, but I need some help in knowing what type of therapy has been good for people that experience acute anxiety in their bodies to the point where they are incapable of moving for hours on end, have a tight chest, have trouble going out or driving a vehicle.

He would unload all his fears, all his past mistakes and shared how he doubted he loved me/doubted I was attractive/doubted I was enough/wondered if I'm a chore to be with/ thought he only dated me for the sex etc. I heard like 50 variations of this over those. He would always reassure me it was his mental illness and to ignore whatever it makes him say. But I couldn't just unfear my worst fears being confirmed by his condition. Adding to that, he has never even seen a psychiatrist or doctor and I feel its a bit rich to dump stuff on my daily for weeks and excuse it all with that.

I don't understand because I LOVE sex, when I'm the one having it.

But, this anxiety response sucks (and is somewhat laughable? I dunno, it feels so irrational) and I don't really understand why it happens, but I'm getting pre-anxious about it since my apartment has thin walls and my roommate is having a dating/romance guest over for the first time. Our bedrooms share a wall, and she's so loud just when she's talking I don't even want to imagine...

Also, we're not close, but I'm getting anxious about the idea of her sharing details, even if the detail.is just a vague ""we did stuff"" because that will deeply disturb me as well but i don't think it's a good idea to be like: hey, if you have sex I don't wanna know about it because maybe she wouldn't say anything anyways?

I will be taking all the precautions:
Fan - check
Earbuds - check
Pillows to hide under - check
Conveniently pausing existing until the guest leaves? Working on that...

593,JonBritt101,1614017576,"There are so many things that I keep thinking about. I have had some negative relationship experiences where I did all the investing, got nothing back, and that was that. It went on for four years. I didn’t treat these relationships like the stock market. But because they were so one-sided on my end, I had to cut ties with them. The anxiety I feel about future relationships and social events is the worst. I know this is more in the social anxiety category, but this social anxiety has brought on some general anxiety as well. I hate this feeling. Don’t get me wrong- I love social interaction. And I have a lot of nice people around me that I know. But I’ve never had that ONE person who likes being around me and investing in me. Sometimes when I’m hanging with a group of “friends,” my stomach gets in knots. I try to be thankful for these people, but I feel lonely inside most of the time, which has brought on this anxiety. I would rather be around people that I know than just be completely alone with no one. When I’m by myself however, my mind goes to anxiety, and I just want cry and wish I could just get rid of it. On the other hand, some days I’m so busy that I don’t focus on my anxiety. 

I also tend to worry about future things like getting a job outside of college( I’m a junior), but that doesn’t help. Yes, it’s good to have long term goals, because I want to get a job that provide for a wife and such. But I don’t even have a girlfriend. And I worry so much about dating, because of these past relationships experiences I have had, where no one reciprocated. Like I said, I enjoy being around people. But sometimes I need time to myself(we all do). A few days ago I cried for about 20 minutes because I hated feeling all these different emotions. I still do. It’s not like they can just go away. I wish they could. Journaling about all this has helped, and I feel that I have somewhat moved forward due to journaling. There are days where I feel “life is good, I’m chilling.” But there are others days where I can’t stop focusing on anxiety and I don’t why. I don’t why I feel all of this now.

This has definitely grown me as a person, but I can’t help feeling anxious and confused, and it’s SO overwhelming. Overthinking doesn’t help either. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don’t. I have started doubting myself, and I hate it, because I know it’s not good. I have so many questions about myself, about my future. Was I too intentional with these people? Did I do anything wrong? Did they not like something about me, but were afraid to say it? People tell me “don’t worry.” I know. But some people don’t know this is like. Some do. I don’t why I feel all these things. I don’t know how to handle all of this.  My breathing is shaky and I just want to cry.

596,10anon95,1614016871,"I’ve (25f) been with my boyfriend (27m) for 4 years. He knows that I struggle with anxiety and has known since the day we met, basically. He is usually pretty considerate of my feelings and knows that I will eventually calm down if given time. 

However, recently, he has told me that he wishes he had superpowers to help me calm down because he really doesn’t know how to help me when I become anxious. I have never really asked him for help dealing with my anxiety. I don’t expect him to know how to calm me down. Usually, I just need some space or just talking through my feelings helps me. I feel like he is hoping to find some “quick fix” to get me to relax, though. 

He didn’t really say it bluntly, but it seems like he gets frustrated when I become upset and he said that I “refuse to listen to him” when he tries to calm me down. He will try to say things to help me, but I will answer with “you don’t understand” or “yes, but that won’t work.” I was having an issue with work recently and he was trying to “calm me down” but he just said that I wouldn’t listen to him. Once the situation was over, he said, “if you had just listened to me then you would’ve realized you were overreacting.” 

It almost felt like I was supposed to apologize for not listening to him, but I didn’t apologize because I shouldn’t feel bad for getting upset. I was worried about work, which is important to me. I have become sort of self conscious about how my anxiety effects others though. Now I feel worried that I am an unreasonable person who just overreacts all the time.

There’s been an announcement here that by summer, things should be largely back to normal. I’m absolutely terrified, it’s making me completely panic just thinking about it. Since I left high school, I’ve never had loads of friends. I have a boyfriend and a couple of really close girl friends who I absolutely bare my soul to. I met my boyfriend in a little gap between lockdowns last autumn and since then we have spent so much time together. It’s worked well for me because I have spent lots of time alone and with my boyfriend which I enjoy and have had an excuse not to be out socialising when I don’t have lots of people to socialise with. 

I feel like I’m going to have intense FOMO when the lockdown is over because I don’t have a load of friends to be going out to the pub with. It makes me wish with all my heart that I had a bigger circle to hang out with so I didn’t feel so alone. I feel full of dread. Does anyone else feel this way?

600,lanalolla,1614016453,"I started using weed regularly about a year ago when my state legalized it. I would say I either smoke or take an edible most days. Up until the last two months, weed really helped me cope with anxiety / depression. I have been really struggling with my mental health the past few weeks. I had about 5 panic attacks over the weekend alone (some I was sober for &amp; other times I was high). 

I was diagnosed w anxiety/depression when I was in the 4th grade so I have dealt with this my entire life - I have also been taking Prozac (&amp; sometimes lexapro) on and off since that time (I am 25). I have been off antidepressants for the past two years and have been managing well... until now. 

I experience seasonal depression yearly and am coming out of that but the anxiety I am dealing with is really affecting my ability to function. This type of anxiety/panic attacks is usually situational and in times of high stress. I’m confused because my life is very stable right now. I’m doing yoga daily, eating healthy, sleeping 9 hours every night, enjoy my job, am 5 months into a new relationship &amp; I’m in therapy. I’m not sure what is triggering the anxiety. I do know that I need help though. 

My mom wants me to go back on antidepressants but I really don’t want to. I hate the way they make me feel. Yes, I don’t have bad anxiety on pills but it’s hard to feel happy. I’m not really sure how to explain it - I feel disconnected from who I am when I’m on pills. I am taking a break from weed to see if that helps. Maybe I should try a strain with more CBD less THC?

602,Just_Long_3438,1614016322,"So does anybody else find making/maintaining relationships exhausting? Especially the superficial ones? For instance, a few coworkers and I work together every day. Been that way shortly after I started. In a way it’s nice not having to work by myself. But on the other hand, it complicates things. My one coworker texted me a couple days ago saying my jokes I make are too “callous and personal”, and that I need to not be so touchy-feely with people. For context I’m very sarcastic and witty when I joke so needless to say some stuff just comes out and I’m working on that. And I suffer from abandonment issues so I’m clingy without even realizing it. Which can obviously make people uncomfortable. Which I certainly don’t want to do. I apologized and said I’d try to do better. But at the same time, I’m growing to despise the way she handles it. Now every time I make a joke she doesn’t like she automatically says, “No! No!” Like she’s talking to a dog or a child. Or if I go to pick a piece of fuzz off someone, this like really bothers me kinda wonder if I’m OCD, she’ll swat my hand away and say, “Do they want to be touched? No. So stop.” Again, like talking to a child. It’s making me not like her. I’m not here to be talked down to. You can express an opinion/feeling without being rude. It’s just ironic coming from someone who claims I shouldn’t “belittle” people with my jokes. Also said individual thinks she’s super open minded but she and the guy in our group made fun of my religion at one point. Never apologized either. And when I told her mom she did apologize, but also made excuses for her. Again claiming she was “open minded” and “meant no harm.” And that she really “valued our friendship.” Which is the main thing. We’re not really friends. We’re just friendly associates. They apparently don’t get that. I’m nice to everybody, that doesn’t automatically make us friends. I’m super cautious about who I make friends with on the rare occasion I do. They’re also not very respecting of my beliefs in general. Like I don’t celebrate holidays but the mom insists on saying, “happy -“ eveytime it’s a holiday. When it was Christmas they got me gifts too which was nice of them, but also awkward for me. When I told the daughter she apologized and said they’d take it into account. But the mom was like, “I know you don’t celebrate I just didn’t want you to feel left out.” Which is nice in itself but like I said she keeps saying “happy holidays” knowing my stance on the matter. Which at that point is just rude. If someone says they aren’t comfortable with something you don’t just continue to say it cause you want to. Like what they expect of me. They expect me not to make “mean” jokes or touch anyone with permission, but then turn around and do stuff like that. Hypocritical, much? Like I said, this is why I don’t form relationships. People just have to make things complicated. Not to mention it feeds profusely into my already terrible anxiety. Like last night the daughter barked at me for a joke I made to a guy, who was joking with me anyway, and I just shut down. I went to the bathroom and cried. I just hate having to be done “perfect” individual for others when they can do/say whatever they want and expect no repercussions. It’s not fair.

Like many of you I'm going through some pretty significant life changes. I've always considered myself a pretty strong person able to roll with the punches. The first 7 months or so of this lock down I fared well. That said, I'm beginning to crack. Between the prolonged lock down, winter, welcoming a new child, and ending a job of 6+ years by choice, I sort of flipped out last week. I've never experienced a panic attack before and it immediately scared the crap out of me (and my wife)! For the first time in my life I'm taking medication and seeking therapy.

The carousel in my head keeps going round and round: how am I going to take care of this child and start a new job? Did I make the right call by changing work? How am I going to pay for childcare? How do I gracefully transition out of old job? Will I have work/life balance or am I just sort of stuck for now? So many unknowns..

All of these things seem trivial but put together they immobilized me. The work thing I sort of known for awhile that I needed a change. I make a good salary but was feeling unfulfilled. Comfortable, but ready for the next thing. I was planning a move last year then BAM the pandemic hit and it seemed foolish to look for new work.

It's a horrible combination of OCD, anxiety, depression, and perfectionism and its completely ripping me to shreds. 

I'm too afraid to start new things, but if I don't then I get bored, when I get bored I become incredibly depressed. If I overcome the anxiety then I have to worry about being good enough for my unrealistic standards, and if I can't do that constantly then I hate myself for it and then it snowballs into a panic attack because it triggers me enough to start thinking about all kinds of other shit. 

So I confine myself to barely doing anything, because I know what happens at this point. I don't drive down new roads because I'm afraid, I don't play new games because I'm afraid I'll be bad at them and get upset with myself. I don't get to do anything.

I worry every night that I'm going to make a mistake the next day and then it'll ruin my day, I can't sleep at night because of it, I wake up a million times a night and keep looking at my stupid fucking phone as time flies by me and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

I'm sick of the pills, I'm sick of doctors. I want my childhood back, I want to be able to smile and mean it. I want to be able to have a good night and not worry about when it's going to end. I hate living with so much regret and being confined to doing the few things I'm not afraid of. I feel like it's been weeks since I've gotten to relax. I had two weeks off of work and all I did was take Adderall and stare at my phone, then crash at 4am and have some of the worst panic attacks I've had in my life, I completely fucking lose it. Staring myself in the mirror I get so mad because the person looking back at me is the cause of all of this. Me, I'm the one who is to blame and nobody else is, I do it to myself. I can't be the person I want to be for my family, for the girl who cares about me and looks past all my flaws and issues, for the few friends that have been stubborn enough to stick around. It feels like half of my brain was designed to destroy me, I feel like I'm broken and this is all just who I am at this point and there's no way out. I don't want a life like that, I don't want to wake up sad every day and have the enjoyment sucked out of every aspect of life. I want to be okay and I can't have that, and it really hurts me to say that and believe it. It's scary to think that this isn't going to go away.

616,HotColdFeels,1614014047," As many others have gone through I lost my original job due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It wasn't until recently that I managed to finally land myself a new job.

For my old job the day was basically split into two halves. The first half I would take individuals with special needs out into the community to do volunteer work or simply to do fun and meaningful activities and try to complete their goals whenever possible. For the second half of the day I would provide respite care to one or two individuals in our centre. It was all good and fine before the pandemic.

Fast forward to now where I got a new job. I'll be driving out to a house that's like 20-30 minutes to me every day. With this individual I'll be helping him build community supports and skills with the end goal being employment. Now what's really stressing me out is the fact that I now have to actually be planning activities as well as managing a work email and phone, nevermind that the policy manual is most likely making the job appear more scary than it actually is.

So right now I'm about to start my third day and I find myself just bawling my eyes out due to stress. At the end of the day I'm going to meet with the client I'm working with over zoom too which adds extra stress. At the same time though I know I can do this, my references from my last job have nothing but good things to say about me too to these guys, and I'm the first worker for a new program too so there's bound to be bumps in the road.

I’ve never had any cavities filled, teeth extracted, root canals, none of that. I know for certain I have at least 2 cavities right now, I can visibly see some decay on two of my teeth. I’m only scheduled for a cleaning, exam, and x ray, but I know I will have to get fillings done eventually, and i’m pretty sure at least 2 of my wisdom teeth will need removed. I’m sort of nervous for the exam, x ray, and cleaning, but what i’m the most nervous for is the fillings and whatever other possible work i’m going to need done. My biggest fear is the local anesthetic. I’m not really nervous about the needle itself, i’m more terrified of having some adverse reaction to the anesthetic itself. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before, but whenever I try something new, especially medicine, I always convince myself i’ll have some adverse reaction. I’ve never been numbed either before, so the feeling of numb has me on edge as well. I know I can’t put off the dentist any longer.

My fears and trying to cope.

Hi guys, 

So for over the last 2 years I’ve had so much anxiety over the fear of having schizophrenia/psychosis and being delusional. Now, last night I had a thought about all of the delusions that people with schizophrenia have and one that popped into my head was about people controlling their thought for example, aliens. This obviously makes me incredibly anxious as it’s a fear that I’ve looked up thousands of times. So when I was sitting watching tv I had a niggle in my head like a dull pain and I read a story that a schizophrenic once thought every time they had a pain in their body, that was evidence of the aliens controlling them. So like I said last night I got that pain and my mind automatically went to “that’s them controlling my mind now” and oh goodness my anxiety absolutely sky rocketed beyond belief. The thing that made my anxiety fly was because it wasn’t a “what if” thought. My mind automatically went to “that’s it happening” is this normal? Does my thoughts always have to be “what if” thoughts for them to be intrusive?? After that thought I then stopped my what if thoughts and started having thoughts along the lines of “all this is true and it’s all real” anxiety was so bad and could hardly sleep. Making up crazy scenarios and situations in my head about my thoughts. For example reading about people’s stories on how they believed the government are tracking them through their devices, this automatically made my thoughts go to “the government have put a tracker in my laptop” not even a what if thought again. Now all my thoughts aren’t starting with what ifs. It’s like the fear of having thoughts that don’t start with what if have made all my thoughts seem real and it’s freaking me out. Severely. Am I anxious and is it my OCD or am I now psychotic? Please can anyone share their experiences or I’m guessing now because it’s not a “what if” thought, that means it’s not anxiety and I am schizophrenic?

I had constant worries of what if something happens with us which led to reassurance seeking, comparing, and even panic attacks. I started going to therapy around November and that has helped a bit but I still had the relationship anxiety, so my doctor decided I should try medication (I was on Zoloft for 3 years). 

Right before starting the medicine, my wife and I wanted to have a little fun so we tried smoking weed (she had never done it and I hadn’t done it in years). I ended up having a panic attack and hating it. Right after I started taking the medicine and had the worst anxiety I’ve had in a long time, so bad that my doctor wanted to stop the medicine after just 4 days. 

Doctor had me take Ativan for a couple days to come down but after that, I had some major relief. Little to no anxiety for almost 2 weeks and didn’t need another Ativan that whole time. All I had was some anxiety here and there so I thought I might as well try Zoloft again since it worked last time and I’m feeling better so it shouldn’t be too bad to really level me out.

Hi all,

For the last year, I've been hired onto a really stressful job. Although the pay is good and I'm living alright, even about to move into an apartment with my girlfriend soon, I still feel like I'm wasting away precious hours every single day.

And I don't mean I'm not being productive or anything. I'm actually working on developing a video game to hone my programming skills even more, and even writing a fiction novel to sate my creative needs. But there is one hunger that is yet to be fully sated in my life: and that's gaming.

When I was in high school/middle school, I used to be really competitive. But I'm not sure when or where that fire was extinguished. I remember feeling *really* alive when I was kicking some ass in Halo or CoD, or League of Legends, or even out-strategizing opponents in Yu-gi-oh or Pokemon. But lately I can barely even pick up these kinds of competitive games anymore.

Now, when I'm sitting in a virtual lobby, or even having my mouse hovering over the ""Find a Match"" button, I start to sweat, shake, breathe heavily- my heart starts beating fast. In the end, I spend more hours working up the nerve to play ONE match than my total playtime overall.

This past week I was on vacation, and I feel like I just wasted it because I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself. It feels like I was just hovering my mouse over the ""Find a Match"" button the whole week.

And this ends up being a problem in my life: after work, I try to work up the sweat to play a game, and I end up wasting hours doing nothing- *I feel like I'm putting off playing games as if it was Homework, like I'm procrastinating or something.* Before I know it, it's like 1 AM on a weekday, and I'm stilling thinking ""I can do it, I can play one game."" Then I just go to bed, feeling like I just wasted my time. Then I can't sleep because I don't feel rested or satisfied. Then cut to maybe 4 AM when I finally get some sleep.

I can play single player games or MMOs or something, but those don't hit that bell of satisfaction for me, the kind of satisfaction that comes from a skill-based, multiplayer online game. I think I can sleep more soundly knowing that I learned something new that I can use to improve my skills, developed a new strategy, or improved my win rate overall. But if I can't scratch that competitive itch due to my anxiety, than it feels like I can't sleep soundly at all! It's like I only feel alive when I know that I've gained the skills to thoroughly kick someone's ass in an online video game.

To those that have gaming experience, I know the usual advice for these kinds of problems: ""In order to cure performance anxiety, create a backup account (usually called a ""smurf"" account). Then you can practice on that account and mess up all you like, and no one will know."" But I've tried that, and it doesn't seem to work when you're afraid of disappointing *yourself.*

I feel like I'm overthinking this and just getting too deep into my own head. I don't really even fully understand why I'm so scared to play games. I'm not afraid to lose- I feel like I learn more from losses than wins. I think I'm just afraid to put in the effort at all now.

I feel like this issue is now starting to snowball and I don't even feel like I'm enjoying life at all anymore.

Does anyone have any advice for something like this?

For me, I’ll have some days when I wake up anxious, just having a feeling of dread for no reason. Yet, this anxiety isn’t crippling to the point where I can’t move or get up out of bed, I just typically feel nervous and the feeling can persist for several hours. It gets worse if I’m alone or have a lot of time to think. Throughout this period of anxiety, I’ll have “breakthroughs” where I feel completely fine, even great. They can last a few seconds or minutes at a time, then I go back to anxiety. As the day progresses, I might be able to shake the anxious feeling completely in the afternoon, but if I don’t, before I go to bed I feel 100% fine. In the last hours of the night before I go to sleep I always feel normal and anxiety free. Is this normal? Does anyone else experience something similar? 

I had anxiety as a kid, but it went away for years after I reached middle school. It’s now coming back after a recent health scare and I don’t remember how it used to feel. I have a therapist appointment upcoming, but I thought I would feel better in the meantime knowing I’m not alone with how I feel.

I explain why I cannot leave my house

""Reasons why it is hard to go outside, however brief (including toiletting dog, taking out trash, both can take less than 2 minutes);

- fear of being seen. Even having a single pair of eyes from anywhere, glance at me for a single, brief moment, is enough to make me freeze &amp; panic the entire time I am not inside, if I've even already made it out
- interaction with neighbours
- obsessively preparing (or lack thereof) to leave the house: getting dressed, eating, feeding pets, checking weather, chores, cleaning. Even if I know in theory I can put my shoes on and leave; there feels like 1 million intricacies inbetween, some of which must be in order, it makes my thinking process freeze, then I panic because I'm losing time (it can take hours). Often I feel defeated, especially when nightfall comes. Then panic starts for the next day, before it even arises
- preparing to have washed hands before touching something dirty before opening front door
- inadequate hygiene
- low mood
- pain (due to medical condition)
- others that I have failed to mention
If even ONE OF THE ABOVE is apparent, I cannot leave the house. ALL OF ABOVE must be in good order to be able to leave. Even if it means not eating, socialising, or seeing daylight for days at a time""

I didnt understand what was going on at the time and had convinced myself there was something wrong with me. I obsessed over this and ended up passing out when I was out one day. 

I opened up people about what was going on and told my therapist about what had happened and that I was anxious about it happening again. Since then, I have always had concerns about passing out in public which have made me anxious. 

Anyway, back to the present... I caught COVID in November and that again triggered my anxiety. I convinced myself I was having a heart attack (I didn't). I then had some inflammation about the sternum and ribs which again led to me being convinced I was having a heart attack (I didn't). A few weeks back I noticed an issue in my foot and leg. The health professional said it could be an aggrevated nerve. But I had convinced myself it was something more serious after reading online (it probably isn't).

So at the start of the year I had a few mental breakdown and my anxiety controlled my every single waking moment for at least 4/6 weeks. I had / have (im still recovering) the worst health anxiety and I had a crazy long list of symptoms that you wouldn't believe.

For the first 2 weeks of coming out of hospital I thought I was going to die at any moment of a heart attack or stroke. I'd be sitting on the sofa with my son hugging him thinking that it was going to be my last hug.

I was always wanting to call 999 / 911 because I was so scared all the time. That non stop feeling of doom was horrid.

Things have gotten a lot better for me over the last few weeks. A lot of my symptoms completely finished but a few are hanging about still but I'm much better at dealing with them.

This takes me to around 3 weeks ago when I noticed I couldn't visualize things in my brain very well anymore. Before my breakdown I had the best times in my own brain. I could play out anything I wished in my mind in full colour.

A lot of my memories were in almost video format if that makes sense? Before bed I could pretend to do or be anything I wished in my mind and I'd fall asleep to this movie in my mind.

Now it is a very different story. I find it very hard to use my minds eye anymore and it gives me this slight headache when ever I try to use it like I used to. When ever I try to use my mind like I used to I feel like it is forcing me not to in my brain. It feels like my brain is saying ""oh no you don't"" if that makes sense?

I can still see images in my mind but no way near as clearly and I feel like I can't control them. They are very fast moving images then they are gone again. I really struggle to control it!

I do feel that things are getting slightly better as I think there was one point that I couldn't even ""see"" my son's face in my mind's eye but i can do that again :)

My doctor didn't seem bothered by anything I've just explained to you and said it was just my mind protecting itself .

My dose was mostly 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg to be max. Since 1 year i was on 0.25 mg of clonazepam. And i decided to quit it cuz i don't feel well with it too, like i don't enjoy things like i used to before being on clonazepam. So i went to my doctor and asked if we can quit. 

PS. I am on my antidepressant too. It's 5 mg Escitalopram now. 

So my doctor told me it's the minimal dose, you can quit it already. When i tried to quit clonazepam 0.25 mg, i had weird withdrawal symptoms, Metallic taste in my tounge, brain zaps, numbness in head, and tingling in scalp, head, and face. So i took 0.125 mg for a week and then decided to take 0.125 mg at alternative days to minimize my withdrawal symptoms on my own. My doctor said it was psychological, anyways... So now it's been 5 days I'm completely off from clonazepam. And I'm having a feeling like my brain is undergoing a lot a lotttttt changes. Like sometimes i feel my emotions are coming back to normal and sometimes it's like I'm completely fucked up. My short term memory is getting cloudy as fuck ( brain fog ) maybe. And also i got chronic sinusitis all of a sudden, pain in my face and tingling. Head congestion and somewhat I'm experiencing cognitive issues. So is it normal to experience all these kinda symptoms when you're quitting a certain drug after 2 years? Will i be normal in few days or a month? I only took 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg to be max.

Firstly I should say my workplace are pulling out the stops to support me and my mental health. I get bouts of insomnia and anxiety and the boss lets me do background tasks rather than forward facing ones when I'm in a bad way (I work in a call centre/helpdesk job). I also work 4 days a week with Wednesdays off so I can recoup.

I'm so lucky in that respect.

But today, I woke up completely out of it and full of anxiety and had to ask for background work... again. 

I do really well on my good days and go above and beyond for the job to make up for lost time. I know they generally want me here based on appraisals and support. But I can't help but berate myself when I have to ask for that support. I still live with the stigma and shame of it. And my family generally believe that you keep a ""stiff upper lip"" when it comes to work so I am carrying that on my shoulders too.

Thing is I don't have the energy to keep a stiff upper lip. And I perform badly at forward facing work when I'm in this state which makes me feel worse. But I feel like I'm taking my workplace for a ride. I don't know if that makes any sense, I'm so tired.

I just needed to say this somewhere and I am sure some of you will think I'm being whiny when I've got it good with my job. I just wanna do my job properly is all. I wanna give it my best shot and I resent my brain for stepping in the way.

677,throwmyway97531,1613996232,"Let me just get this out of the way. This is a throwaway account, and you'll see why. 

I know I'm letting my anxiety get the best of me.

I took care of someone the other night that had two bloodborne diseases. 

There was no blood to blood contact, no frank blood on my skin.. my clothing had come in contact with the environment, but no blood on my clothes that I'm aware of. 

But I still had thoughts.. my pants were slightly too long.. what if the hem of my pants stepped on traces of blood on the floor? I did wipe my shoes off with bleach, but.. What if I'd accidentally gotten some on my shirt sleeve without realizing it? Or brushed up against dried blood and then put that piece of clothing on a seat in my car? I accidentally touched my break pedal trying to pick something up off of the floor.. what if I'd forgotten to wipe off my shoes one day and transferred something to my hand? 

I know it's said that regular wash and high heat dry cycles are fine, but really only bleach kills certain things.. I was hesitant to wash my clothing in it at first, afraid it would discolor them. So I used my regular detergent, which is All Free &amp; Clear, added Clorox for Colors, Lysol Laundry sanitizer in the soak/rinse cycle.. then another 2 separate cycles in Dawn Dish Soap. And then I finally broke down and added bleach and washed them again. I dried them on high for an hour and then ran them through the 'Sanitize' dryer option after that. And I was still hesitant to touch them after all that. I washed my undergarments in the same load and the thought is crossing my mind to just throw them away. 

Never before have I reacted like this. I would be embarrassed if anyone I knew found this out. I acknowledge that I have anxiety and I've noticed that it's really gotten worse with a new job and this pandemic.. but this is my trigger. Since I know this, I'm trying to find a position with less risk involved.

685,Just_Long_3438,1613993506,"So does anybody else find making/maintaining relationships exhausting? Especially the superficial ones? For instance, a few coworkers and I work together every day. Been that way shortly after I started. In a way it’s nice not having to work by myself. But on the other hand, it complicates things. My one coworker texted me a couple days ago saying my jokes I make are too “callous and personal”, and that I need to not be so touchy-feely with people. For context I’m very sarcastic and witty when I joke so needless to say some stuff just comes out and I’m working on that. And I suffer from abandonment issues so I’m clingy without even realizing it. Which can obviously make people uncomfortable. Which I certainly don’t want to do. I apologized and said I’d try to do better. But at the same time, I’m growing to despise the way she handles it. Now every time I make a joke she doesn’t like she automatically says, “No! No!” Like she’s talking to a dog or a child. Or if I go to pick a piece of fuzz off someone, this like really bothers me kinda wonder if I’m OCD, she’ll swat my hand away and say, “Do they want to be touched? No. So stop.” Again, like talking to a child. It’s making me not like her. I’m not here to be talked down to. You can express an opinion/feeling without being rude. It’s just ironic coming from someone who claims I shouldn’t “belittle” people with my jokes. Also said individual thinks she’s super open minded but she and the guy in our group made fun of my religion at one point. Never apologized either. And when I told her mom she did apologize, but also made excuses for her. Again claiming she was “open minded” and “meant no harm.” And that she really “valued our friendship.” Which is the main thing. We’re not really friends. We’re just friendly associates. They apparently don’t get that. I’m nice to everybody, that doesn’t automatically make us friends. I’m super cautious about who I make friends with on the rare occasion I do. They’re also not very respecting of my beliefs in general. Like I don’t celebrate holidays but the mom insists on saying, “happy -“ eveytime it’s a holiday. When it was Christmas they got me gifts too which was nice of them, but also awkward for me. When I told the daughter she apologized and said they’d take it into account. But the mom was like, “I know you don’t celebrate I just didn’t want you to feel left out.” Which is nice in itself but like I said she keeps saying “happy holidays” knowing my stance on the matter. Which at that point is just rude. If someone says they aren’t comfortable with something you don’t just continue to say it cause you want to. Like what they expect of me. They expect me not to make “mean” jokes or touch anyone with permission, but then turn around and do stuff like that. Hypocritical, much? Like I said, this is why I don’t form relationships. People just have to make things complicated. Not to mention it feeds profusely into my already terrible anxiety. Like last night the daughter barked at me for a joke I made to a guy, who was joking with me anyway, and I just shut down. I went to the bathroom and cried. I just hate having to be done “perfect” individual for others when they can do/say whatever they want and expect no repercussions. It’s not fair. Now I kinda wish, like most relationships, I hadn’t started anything with them at all. I just want to curl up in a ball and shut everyone out.

Antidepressants, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are widely used to treat and prevent a variety of anxiety disorders. SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) which act on serotonin and norephinephrine, and some of the tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine (Tofranil), may also help.
In the last few years, some long-term side effects of serotonergic medications have emerged and regulators like the EMA have started to inform the consumers about these risks. Since 2019, the European leaflets of SSRIs and SNRIs should include a note about sexual dysfunctions persisting after discontinuation, also known as PSSD, in accordance with the provisions of the following recommendation: [2019 PRAC recommendation](https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/prac-recommendation/prac-recommendations-signals-adopted-13-16-may-2019-prac-meeting_en.pdf).

You try so hard to have everyone like you till you become someone you hate. You create a persona of yourself that you want to destroy but can’t. You hear others say that what you are feeling is not as bad as others. But you can’t help but think , ‘ why is it a competition?’ ‘ why must what i’m feeling be on pr of others’ 
Can you even say you have anxiety when people around say that its just for attention?

It got a lot better when I became a teenager but now I’m 21 and I feel like I’m back at square one. This “episode” started a few weeks ago when my boyfriend’s dad and his family had the stomach flu and my boyfriend goes to the gym with him almost every single day. I woke up one night and had a panic attack because I kept overthinking about the possibility of throwing up and well that shit hasn’t really stopped. I actually did get better but had a step back when a barista put regular milk in my coffee and I shat out my intestines because of it and also thought I was going to throw up and had yet another panic attack. 

Now every single morning (thankfully not the middle of the night) I wake up very abruptly at like 6 am and think that my body is telling me to get my ass up bc I gotta puke. And then I panic, overthink, get nauseous, and eventually fall asleep. And then I’m tired for the rest of the day. I feel like it’s not gonna get better at all even though I’ve been getting better at calming myself down and having my boyfriend’s hand to hold but still.

So I (F, 20) recently went through a breakup after a year long relationship (ex was M, 21) and I'm just miserable. I find myself replaying every moment and my brain just making up scenarios and questioning everything that happened and just making me feel like I'm going insane. I literally had to call my ex and ask him if stuff I was thinking was all in my head or not. The main thing I worry about deals with sex. I think a big part of it is that sex was a new thing for me in the relationship and so I was terrible about communicating things. He went along with me and respected whatever I told him. My brain now is just focused on was x,y,z okay. Like for example was it okay that we didn't always verbal switching from vaginal sex to oral sex and back when we were having sex (which like it was fine back then). I don't know maybe it's just cause I didn't have experience so I didn't really know how most people handled things. And then my brain just drives on it for a while. Or my brain will make up scenarios like what if he did x without asking or he ignores when I said no or something like that. And I know that's not true because we would have broken up if something like that had happened or I would have actually remembered. 


I know I have anxiety and depression and I have been seeing a therapist and I feel like we've made some progress but I still just find myself at constant war with myself and it's exhausting. I also just feel like I'm not there anymore and it's hurting my relationships there any advice for moving forward and trying to get better and actually move forward instead of stressing about the past?

The course load is so overwhelming that i just tend to freeze up and don’t do anything. But then i get really down and hard on myself for being so behind. It’s this vicious cycle and it’s making me really angry with myself. It’s also starting to affect me at school because i’m making mistakes during in person labs.

718,lippidude,1613978335,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for about a decade now. From the age of 18 a 29. Around the age of 23 I managed to cope so well that I didn’t feel anxiety or depression anymore than a normal person would. Sure my eyes had been opened to what that works was like. But I coped with it, without medication, and I could say I was normal. This is huge and I want everyone to know that it is possible. You can feel normality again. 

I was an idiot though. I used drugs at a music festival, knowing that my one fearful trigger was drugs. There was a lot of work I had done to no longer fear drugs but instead casually enjoy them. Though I wasn’t doing drugs nearly as frequently as my peers. But I over went my limits and it landed me at square one again. 

My issue today is that my tolerance for discomfort and courage is significantly less than it was at 18. I’m 29 now, that music festival was 5 years ago. I have been sober ever since and my life is still not back on track. 

Recently I had been doing all right. Working from home. Gaming in the evenings. Seeing friends when the pandemic allowed. But I had a set back in December that is still taking it’s toll on me now. 

My anxiety has always been accompanied with psychotic symptoms when I’m under incredible stress. And though I didn’t feel I was incredibly stressed the pandemic, lack of movement and motion, poor diet, social interactions could all have contributed to some under the radar stress that I hadn’t pieced together. 

Since then I have been scared. Scared that I’m I borrowed time. That my life is never meant to get on a predictable track. Never meant to be enjoyed. My depression is heavier. My anxiety is leading me to all sorts of poorly drawn conclusions. I have brain fog that’s been present for years. But is so thick now I can barely remember anything I do day over day. And I actually have to face the potential of taking medication. 

I’m overwhelmed. I’m beat up. I read so many posts talking about how the triumph over this pain is a true testament to the strength I have. To be honest. I’m just scared and counting the hours to when I can go to bed next. Hoping I wake up a little less scared. But I’m living in a haze. Unable to think, unable to plan. I have a few hunches as to what I should’ve doing. Like addressing potential gut health issues I have or sleep apnea I was also tested for. But even then, if there was a god, what have I done so wrong to live such a life robbed of basic pleasures. I’m pretty atheist as is, but this thought really puts a nail in that coffin. 

I’m coming across very intense and sappy. I just don’t know what to do anyMOre. I’m not suicidal, that thought doesn’t cross my mind, but I’m not motivated anymore, and this brain fog is so bad I can’t even figure out what to do next. I’m just hoping someone will have some idea of what they’d do next, or what this had done to get away from feeling trapped. I want to live. I want to love my hobbies. I want to feel passion and motivation. I want a girl friend and to feel valued. I want to feel real and that the world around me has color and beauty. 

I’m not a lot of things. I’m not cute, rich, conventional, simple, suave, witty, etc. and honestly as much as I wish I could be some of those things.

Anyone who can kindly read through this long post and offer advice, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. ❤️ 

Hi. This is a really long post but I need outside perspective interpreting the conversation as I can’t think clearly. A bit of context. We’ve been seeing each other for 3 months now. We like each other a lot and have decided we are exclusive (and more than a hookup) at the end of January. We’re both burned from previous relationships (though his was more recent) so we’ve been taking things slow, especially with labels. We explicitly agreed that we were not ready for bf/gf labels yet but in a few months, we will talk about it.

On Saturday, we were supposed to have a lovely date but he got super anxious that day and we canceled the date. We talked on the phone twice. Basically, he’s freaking out because he’s starting to feel like a boyfriend but he’s not sure if he’s ready to yet. I told him we can just stop seeing each other because I’d hate to be strung along. But he said that’s not it, he’s just genuinely anxious. I told him I really like him but I’m not ready to be a gf either so what about we check back in in a few months and see. We agreed. He seemed to get a little bit after our phone conversations but I’ve been spiralling since. I can’t help but think that my trust has been betrayed. He said he’s becoming so emotionally intimate with me and it is scaring him a little. He has been more vulnerable than me that’s for sure. I have started to let my guards down a little but his has been down for a while. I don’t understand why he suddenly feels scared about that. 

Note: We both have anxiety (I’m diagnosed and have regular treatment. Pretty sure he can be diagnosed - he has seen a therapist for short term).

This was the first text he sent yesterday before we got on the phone and talked:

“A few things come to mind. Now that I'm working again.. i think there is pressure to have a good weekend and get refreshed and do my chores and I worry it won't be enough time or something. And I feel bad about not wishing you luck on your interview yesterday (even though it got rescheduled). But that makes me feel weird because I don't want to feel guilty. It's like a boyfriend guilt or something. But then I'm like ""am I a boyfriend now?"" which also stresses me out because I don't know that I'm ready to feel like that. Like I know  we are taking it slow but also it feels like we're not? I don't know to explain properly perhaps. Ugh sorry.”

And today, I’ve been feeling like shit and for the first time in the three months that we’ve been dating, I’m frustrated and hurt (and maybe a bit angry and scared but I don’t know how to process this part). Below is the conversation we had today.

Me: “I have been anxious today, and frustrated and hurt. The latter two, I'm not sure how to tackle. I'll figure it out. Enjoy your bath! Hope you're feeling better today!”

Him: “Thanks b. Frustrated and hurt? Uh oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Frustrated and hurt with regards to me?”

Me: “I'm not sure. I thought I was kind and safe to you but I'm causing you anxiety so I'm frustrated. Am I doing anything that triggers your past hurt? I'd hate to be an unkind person who does that.”

Me: “If I ever pushed you to become more intimate than you were ready for, I am sorry. I don't know the details of what went down but I just know it was difficult for you, and it makes me so sad to know that. You're a very good person and you deserve to heal at your pace. I thought I've been patient all along but if I haven't been, please let me know. I support whatever is best for your heart. I hope you know that.”

Him: “There is nothing at all you've done that is unkind or unbecoming in any way. I'm sorry you're frustrated and I definitely don't want to be unkind or cause any pain or anxiety. I think im still.figuring out what I need and I apologize if it feels like I'm giving mixed messages. My own anxiety is not coming from anything you're doing but more from me being unsure of what I need at this time in my life. I enjoy all the time we've spent together and I have no regrets.”

Him: “You are an incredibly kind person. You didn't push anything on me.. we get along and we are physically attracted to each other so naturally the intimacy has progressed. Not your fault. And not a bad thing but still kinda scares me.”

Me: “I am so scared haha. You're great at intimacy, I have been at a slower pace than you are. But still it's new to me to be this emotionally intimate with someone.”

Him: “I am sorry if I am too intense in that way 😅”

Me: “But I don't wanna run though. Is that okay with you that I don't wanna run?”

Him: “Yes. I missed kissing you this weekend. 😘”

Me: “Well, we can kiss a lot when we see each other next. :)”

Him: “Perfect.”

Part of me wants to run for the hills because I’ve been strung along six years by someone in the past. But part of me thinks that he’s just being honest with me and he wants to work on this with me.

721,fantomftw,1613977350,"Hi Redditors,

I am Sameer, from India. On NYE I was diagnosed with GAD when I developed symptoms like derealisation, impending doom and other common symptoms. Never had a full-blown panic attack though.

I went to see a psychiatrist. He prescribed me zapiz 0.25 in the morning and Nexito plus in the night for 15 days.
While I was taking those medicines, I felt good. Didn't develop any anxiety symptoms anymore.

After 15 days, I went back to the doctor for review, he cut down the morning tablet (zapiz) and replaced the Nexito with Ventab at night for a month.

But, as I start taking Ventab, the derealisation started to hit me at night. I was really scared. I thought I had developed scrizophrenia. So I decided to go for a psychotherapist.
She told me that I don't have scrizophrenia (Hush!)
She started the CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). 
And it worked! Slowly, slowly, the derealisation tapered off!

Simultaneously, I was taking Ventab at night for 30 days as prescribed.  I was feeling normal. Sometimes the anxiety hit me, but I coped with it. After a month, once the medicine course was over, I went to see the psychiatrist for review.

He prescribed another tab - Nexvenla OD plus 50. Another benzo. I asked him how long do I have to take the meds. He told me it will about a year.

I really don't wanna develop tolerance for benzo and suffer through withdrawal. I really wanna stick to the CBT. I am writing this as I am returning to home from the doctor.

Please suggest what should I do.
Any help would be appreciated :)

 To give more insight to how this unfolded, my friend who was previously in the executive committee said that I am suitable for the job and that I am fully capable of it. I thought so hard on it and was close to rejecting it, but I felt bad rejecting and my family thought it'll look great on the paper so I decided to do it. 

I've promised myself to never take on such leadership l roles when I got to university(as I am always in one ever since I was in elementary school), because I get really panicky and anxious. I get so scared about how I might mess up my job or feel that I'm not qualified enough for this job. What's worse is that I'm as awkward as I can get. I try so hard to not say the wrong things and try to hard to paint a perfect image which gets my anxiety level at its peak. 

I already said yes to the position and even got invited to the chat group, but my anxiety has gotten worse. I'm in a sports club and being the only female committee member freaks me the fuck out. Nothing wrong with being the only female but guys usually are closer together and I don't want to seem too distant. I am awkward as heck I don't know why my friend recommended me.. What's worse is I'm in my native country yet since I've lived most of my life overseas I suck at the language department. Which freaks me out even more than it should. I can't even remember how to breathe... gosh why did I say yes to this.. but anyway fingers crossed hopefully I will complete my job and get out in piece.

Now, I had a church background for a while, but had went away from it for some time. I consider myself a Christian again and am regaining my faith, but that's not the main point of my story. As I've been getting older, it feels like my anxiety only worsens, and I now constantly worry about people I love dying or it can be as simple as seeing actors/actresses on TV much older than I remember and I get self conscious about life being short and me getting older, and how it feels like my life just got somewhat enjoyable but it's already feeling like too much time has passed.

After a fee arguments with my s/o,I was angry after it. It was just a normal argument. They had been stressed and became very snappy and all. They weren't ever abusive. But in my anger,I went to Yahoo answers and asked a question saying ""are they abusive?"" And listed a few things. I said how they never talk stuff out (they do. I lied.) I said how they never say sorry (also not true.) And I said they had anger issues (which is true but they're doing better with it. But I said in the question that they weren't.) 
Anyway,these questions I took them down. I feel so awful for asking this online when I KNOW they aren't abusive. They actually worry about if they are or not and make a lot of effort to be a kind person. They're jot abusive. But I worded it in a way that came off very exaggerated and I feel so bad. Is this the worst thing ever? The questions are deleted and were on anon.

So.. I'm an alcoholic beginning recovery in an institute in three weeks. Which I'm proud of, I'm deferring my university studies for the time being (for many reasons,, as well, like almost everyone on this site I'm in engineering) and have the university backing me so I shouldn't have \*many\* repercussions. 

To begin, what do I do outside of said recovery? I'll just come home to my house, with my alcoholic, stroke riddled father, my stressed backwards mother dealing with her own mother having a stroke and my grandmother (her mother in law) dealing with cancer. My Grandmother is in good spirits which is good, but then my oma just got attacked by another resident at her home. I don't blame the resident as her mental health is likely... no longer here. I'm currently worried about my mother as well as myself, namely because she is fighting her damndest and I am too. I do need to focus on me right now for I am dealing with a sincere medical issue but I worry about my mother more so. I'm sorry to go ahead and talk to the reddit community but I've liked this group alot, and they seem to be comforting when I'm an an all time low... 

I do have a job, which apparently I'm phenomenal at \~I'm an amazon driver\~ and I do accept alot of compliments there based on ethic and what have you, dedication etc.. I don't mean to brag but I am good at it. I tend to call and care about my clients needs such as package placements and recieve quite a bit of praise from them because of it.. don't know where to go from here but that makes me happy  

This pandemic really has made things incredibly hard, namely because I'm also not a first year who is willing to cheat to make there parents happy. And before you say ""I didn't cheat"" I know that most of you have been, the temptation is too great. And that was tackled in another article I wrote not too long ago so I'll digress. That is fing infuriating. the last class at my school does not appear to have failed anyone, I know I failed my first year calculus, as well as the other 66% of my class, and we're all better for it! .. but again.. digression 

Honestly, I would just like to crack a joke or make a meme, but I'm too old to pretend like I'm happy living in this situation. I have counselors and doctors \*now\* that are willing to go to bat for me and that should be the takeaway. When one feels so enveloped in in there own depression and anxieties, it is worthwhile that one reaches out and find a community that can help. Personally, I won't treat you any different, and I'll look at your intelligence first before I consider whatever it is you're going through to be a detriment.

727,AdFlimsy6692,1613977011,"I’ve been off of social media for two months now and I honestly do not miss it at all. I do not miss seeing random updates of an acquaintance whom I barely care about,I do not miss comparing my life to everyone’s highlight reel and I just don’t miss keeping ‘up-to-date’ with people’s lives on social media. 

If I wanted to know how my friend is doing,I will call them up or meet with them the last thing I will do is go on social media. Then I realised how anxious I used to get about not posting a new photo for some time,I used to think shit,people must think that nothing interesting is happening to me oh and shit,people must see me as irrelevant.It was sad and pathetic of me. 

Let’s be honest,how many times have you planned an outing or an outfit just so you can show it off on social media? I love dressing up even before social media exists but I realised that then I have done it for the wrong reasons. And for what? For people who do so little for me,for fake validations and fake love mostly. 

I might go back on social media,but only if I had the right intention. I am trying to be that person my younger self needed or just that person my current self needs. And it’s not who I have presented myself to be on social media in the past,only posting photos where I looked good for further validation and just posting every single thing on my story so that it looks like I’m having a ball.

728,nbvalid,1613976133,"
My boyfriend (24) and I (22F) have been together for almost 2 years now. The beginning of our relationship was really happy and although it’s been really rocky since the pandemic started I still love him to death. He’s the only person Ive been able to connect so much with and we have even spoken about marriage before because we love each other so much. But ever since the pandemic happened, it’s really gone downhill.

We live together and we are both college students doing all of our classes through Zoom. He doesn’t have a job nor wants one. I work from home so I don’t really leave our house very often. Last semester, I was keeping us afloat financially as I was our only source of income and spreading myself thin with classes and work. This semester his parents have started helping him out with the bills so it’s taken some weight off of me, but he still owes me like $600 and it really sucks being the only one working. Regardless, the problem is he’s become completely delusional. 

Every day he finds a new health issue to be concerned about. He’s been going to therapy but I don’t think it’s helping him much at ALL and he doesn’t seem to be taking it seriously. He has a history of depression, self harm, and BPD.  He started taking pysch meds to help him but he stopped taking them because he convinced himself he had all the side effects. It’s been really rough. Here are some of the delusions he’s had:

-Convinced himself he had a full body rash when he didn’t have a thing on him. He started crying and panicking and this went on for hours as I tried reassuring him he was fine, but he ultimately got offended that I couldn’t see the nonexistent rash and started lashing out at me. Finally the next day after nearly going to the hospital over a non existent rash, he woke up and told me realized he had imagined the whole thing and just brushed it off? The worst part is he doesn’t even have any empathy for the stress he puts me through and barely addresses how this affects me. 

-Convinced himself he had rabies even though he hasn’t been in contact with any wild animals. This went on for weeks and he refused to leave the house and constantly complained about it. He didn’t have rabies. 

-Convinces himself he has COVID every week and has been making us get COVID tests almost every 2 weeks because he convinces himself we have COVID when we don’t even leave our house. He’s really isolated me from my friends and we haven’t seen much of anybody in months (esp since I work from home) but somehow he thinks we got COVID from like the grocery store even though we wear masks and don’t get within 10 feet of anybody. 

- Lately, he keeps convincing himself he has a heart condition and is going to have a heart attack. Anytime he becomes aware his heart is beating he freaks out and starts having a panic attack. I’m talking multiple panic attacks every day. It’s really been affecting me cause I live with him and I feel bad and have to calm him down but I have to work to do. He’s gone to Urgent care twice in the past two weeks, and like 3 times to the doctor as well. His doctor and family even seem to be tired of him but they keep monitoring his heart out of precaution but nothing is coming up. He has no family history of heart conditions and he’s 24 and has no prior health conditions or illnesses too.

Lastly, one of the worst parts is he sleeps ALL day. I’m talking 12-18 hours a day. Usually ranging at 15. And the few hours he is awake he’s just having panic attacks. It’s driving a huge wedge in our relationship. I barely spend any time with him, and he doesn’t wake up until like 8 pm . I barely get to talk to him anymore, besides calming him down from his panic attacks and hearing him CONSTANTLY whine about these nonexistent health problems. I’m talking finding a new illness on WebMd almost every week and convincing himself he has it. It gets really annoying.

One of the most concerning things about all of this is I’ve tried addressing his behavior and sleeping habits multiple times. He doesn’t seem to care that he sleeps all day and has multiple panic attacks, he doesn’t seem interested in wanting to change his sleep schedule and when I complain he just makes a joke about how nice sleeping is. I’ve tried helping him become more motivated and the only thing he seems to be interested in is his non existent health problems. And even though he is slightly aware of his delusions it doesn’t seem to deter his behavior. 

I miss how our relationship was before this pandemic. I miss being able to do things together, I miss leaving the house and feeling like normal people. His constant anxiety and stress is really affecting me, but we live together and we have this whole life together so breaking up seems so difficult especially since I’m working from home and I barely get to see anybody. I don’t know what to do. What do I do ? Please help and be kind.

740,cheezeblock777,1613972292,"Hello guys,

I am REALLY anxious right now. I don’t typically write things like this but I hope someone out there can relate in any way. 

I have been in college since Fall 2018 and have been working to get my associates degree for transfer. It’s taken me this long because I originally went to a four year university only to withdraw from the school right before finals during my third semester because I had a really deep depression going on and I was having suicidal ideations. I would self medicate with weed and would procrastinate on work and basically be selfish. Eventually, everything I was doing caught up to me and my parents put me in a treatment center where I received mental help and a revitalized sense of discipline and order. 

I also decided that I didn’t want to go back to the college I was going to, so I decided to go to a local community college to finish up my 60 units that are required to transfer to a college that I would maybe be proud to go to. At this community college (that I am still attending) I have done work that is way better than I have ever achieved at university. At university I was getting Cs and Bs but now I’m getting As with the occasional Bs, so it’s been helpful to bring my GPA up to help me transfer out. 

Last semester, I was scared that I wouldn’t be able to even be accepted to a college, however, I have already been accepted to one of my top 3 choices. In fact, it was the very first decision I have heard back so far, and I applied to about 13 more schools. Just applying to schools was a $1000 investment, so in this case I feel satisfied that no matter what the other colleges say, I know that one of my top choices have said YES! However, due to a misstep when I was initially transferring to my community college, I’m not sure if any of this even matters in the first place.

See, when I was first doing the work from my treatment center to go back to school, my community college needed a few things from me and one of those things was my official transcript from CSUN. When I went to get counseling to get my transcript evaluated, I brought my unofficial transcript since that’s all they required. I came with 24 units to my name and they still took 3 units off because I got a C- in Statistics in university and I guess a solid C is like the cutoff in order to transfer units. 

Anyways, since the last year I have had my university send my official transcripts by hard copy and by PDF to my community college three times in total. It doesn’t help that the student portal for my college is a piece of shit, so I still have not seen it reflected there. I know for a fact that the transcript orders were processed every time and I did everything thing in my power in order to get it to my CC. What worries me is that the college that I got accepted to gave me a conditional acceptance, which means I have to have some documents sent to them in order for them to give me an official acceptance. One of those things is the verification that I am going to get my Associates degree for transfer by the end of this semester. I also want to add that a couple weeks ago I went online to get express counseling during the first day of school but the person I got connected with couldn’t help me because the database for the college was down at the time (something to this effect) but told me that the student portal isn’t really reliable but I’m still worried that somehow it’s correct and that I’m fucked. 

Here lies the problem,

I don’t know if I am going to get this verification of transfer, because on my shitty ass student portal, it says that I still need to take two more classes that are my school’s equivalent to micro and macroeconomics. The thing here is that I have already completed both those classes with a “B” but now I’m wondering why when I was initially getting my transcripts evaluated, why didn’t they just apply it to my student portal, which is like the main thing any student at my college can use to know whether they are on track to graduate or not. If everything goes according to plan, all I need to do is complete my current classes, get this verification, and I’m in the clear and if that day comes I’ll celebrate the fuck out of it and then go back to working hard. However if that day doesn’t come, then that will hit me like a ton of bricks.

I don’t want to waste another year of my life due to something out of my control. The past is the past, but I’ll be damned if I didn’t try my best. I’m just really scared right now that everything I did just didn’t fucking matter at all. Worried, that I’ll be accepted to more colleges without having the opportunity to take those chances because my own CC fucked me out of a transfer degree.

I’m meeting with a counselor on Wednesday to determine the outcome. That day is pivotal.

745,Nicofatpad,1613971081,"The background is that I’ve been struggling with ADHD and Anxiety my entire life. To the point where others find my behavior and I too would fine my reactions to things extremely overblown and my anxiety crippling to an unbreakable point. I got my ADHD meds starting March of last year and have always talked about my anxiety to my Psychiatrist but never thought it was bad enough to have it treated as well...

Well two weeks ago, I was dming some girl back and forth, and one of the jokes I cracked didn’t exactly land? Basically the joke was about the girl’s favorite celebrity who just posted a picture with a cute lil dog. I basically said something about how bad she wishes she could be a dog. Okay stupid joke wtv. But I seriously didn’t think it could be taken sexually or degrading? Like people in our fandom make stupid jokes like that all the time. 

Thing is, she blew it tf out of proportion and started telling me I made her feel uncomfortable and started saying “smh” over and over. Her friends got involved and started telling me off. I personally thought I said something abusive or truly inappropriate. I also thought I was about to be exposed or cancelled for it. It was two of my biggest fears: degrading a woman and being cancelled/losing my potential career. I proceeded to having a panic attack, blocking her on everything so that I don’t have to see anything else she would have to say to me.

I had a nervous breakdown, started sweating, breathing heavy, then not breathing much at all. I started getting extremely dizzy, losing my mind as I thought this would be the end. (End of what? idk. but my mind doesnt exactly work correctly?) As the room spun around me I stumbled into the couch then fainted. Woke up with fam asking what happened and I just said I overworked myself at the gym(home gym).

Then I told my friends about what really happened and how I had a crazy panic attack and thought my world was going to end. I looked back at what I texted and realized she just cant take a joke, and even if that made her uncomfortable oh well that wasn’t even my intention I apologized, clarified, and still she couldn’t give me the benefit of the doubt.
 
Her friends started subtweeting stuff like “not this guy trying to steal my friend” or something like that. Funny thing is I like boys, and Idek if I like girls like that. Last time I had a serious crush on a girl was 4 years ago. I’m obviously homo asf, I literally drooled over the same celebrities she was obsessed with(yes homo). Not to mention I’ve never even been in any relationship,  never even romantically held hands with someone. I’m probably closer to asexual if anything. She didn’t know that so she probably thought I was just some guy trying to take advantage but still...

Okay I’m getting too far away from the main point. So after this, I told my psychiatrist about what happened and they totally agree my anxiety overblew the situation and it was an example of how harmful my anxiety could potentially get. Like during that whole nervous breakdown/losing consciousness I literally googled stroke symptoms and I genuinely thought something bad was happening to me.

Probably never talking to the girl ever again even though I just wanted to be friends. I mean theres no turning back from blocking her on basically everything, but I mean I only did that cause I’m sensitive as hell and if I heard one more bad thing about me I’d probably have an actual heart attack. And it absolutely sucks that I had to put myself through something like this but I’m so glad it happened cause first of all it lead me to getting my highly needed treatment, and it made me realize I have no business talking to people that #1 can’t take a joke, and #2 gaslights me when what I said was far from perverted.",Anxiety,This certain traumatic situation lead me to finally getting my anxiety treated by psychiatrist.

She asked me if I was a student and I said yes, and she said students get a discount. So I went into the changing room and had no luck with the clothes so the same lady helped me pick out some other clothes. 

I went into the change room again and I guess I was taking too long so she knocked on the door and asked me how it’s going. I paused and thought she was becoming suspicious of me so I quickly got out and decided to purchase one of the clothes even though I didn’t want anything. I got even more paranoid when the man at the counter asked for my email because apparently they need my email to give me a discount.

748,scrawny_mfer,1613970875,"I'm a week from turning 19 and I've been having so much anxiety over it . I've always been kind of indifferent to birthdays. Don't get me wrong, I love going all out for other people, I absolutely loathe my own. Why? Because it's literally everything I hate wrapped into one.
For starters, I have struggled with social anxiety since I was a kid. I don't want a disorder to affect my life. So the best way to do that is to avoid anything that triggers it if possible. This includes parties, large gatherings, being the center of attention, people ""ooing"" and ""ahhing"" over me, etc. This is pretty much all a birthday is.
If someone casually sends a HBD text or just says it once when they see me, that's cool and much appreciated. I just hate when people try to make a huge deal when I ask them not to. For example, constantly asking what I wanna do or saying HBD everytime you see me. Ofcourse you have the occasional ""Oh let's _____ *insert something that person wants to do* because it's MY birthday. 
Don't get me started on restaurants. Having a group of people, especially strangers, sing to me sounds like a nightmare. That's basically giving me a panic attack as a present for my birthday.
Putting me in the spotlight of anything just gives me unnecessary anxious tendencies. I'm not trying to be mean or spit on other people's excitement, but not many really get it.
I know people are just trying to be nice. However, when I specifically ask them to not do something and they do it because ""it's your birthday"" and ""we needd to celebrate"" I don't appreciate it. Infact, I fucking hate it. Overall, I just wish it was treated like a normal day. I don't know why I have this anxiety or what causes it, I just wish people would be respectful and not try to make it about them. Overall, I just wish it was treated like a normal day.

Hope you are all doing great. I've just made huge progress when it comes to going outside and exercising. I used to spend all day playing games and having panic attacks ar home.

My issue currently is that after going out with my bike or after the first couple of exercises at the gym I get really anxious, out of balance and confused. I've done bloodwork, everything is okay. This has happened to me in the past but I overcame it somehow. I also have this strange thing where after going to the toilet or before I'd get really anxious physicically, almost like collapsing, again nothing found by any doctor. 

Is there anyone else who had something similar? If so, how can I overcome this?

Speaking of taking your mind off things, that’s a big one for me, I distract myself often, I draw or play guitar or scroll through TikTok for a few hours (that last one probably isn’t as productive though)

I don’t drink caffeine anymore, apparently caffeine can trigger anxiety/anxiety symptoms so I don’t even bother with it, plus soda is bad for you anyway

Having an exercising routine or exercising often helps too, doesn’t have to be anything extreme, just something to relieve stress, hot showers are good too :p

I’m just here to vent hoping it helps. Two years ago I decided to go on medication (lexapro) for anxiety. 

My anxiety slowly began to disappear and for the first time ever I understood what living “normal” life feels like. 

Things began to look up I started to work on myself with therapy I found the root of most my problems. Basically had a Narcissistic father who did everything in his power to kill my self esteem. 

My plan was to use lexapro until I had a good understanding on how to manage my anxiety. I officially stopped taking the medication in October. I had a smith transition with little to no side effects. I have been adjusting to life without SSRI which hasn’t been all that difficult. Until three days ago when I decided to get my financial life on track. I’ve had credit card debt from relocations to a new city,  roughly 10k. This used to be one of my biggest triggers. The lexapro took that away in fact it pushed me the other way and I began to spend a lot of money. Then the quarantine happened which  was rough on me, since I live alone and in a new city. Other than work I’ve been alone for over a year now. So back to three days ago when I finally decided to look at my credit card statements. In two years of being on medication I managed to get myself in $65,000 worth of debt. 

I’ve been trying to figure out how to manage this situation, my payments are way too high and the interest rates alone are killing me. I feel so numb and lost, how could I have been so irresponsible? For context I am 34 years old and up until two years ago I had impecable credit and money managing abilities, that is the reason I have so much credit to begin with. 

After going through my options I feel as none of them are going to be good. I am basically fucked. The anxiety is coming back I can feel the depression creeping in. I don’t know how to handle it. I’m alone in a city where I don’t know anyone, and stuck in quarantine. Part of me is extremely upset and the situation and part of me is numb and afraid of what is going to happen to me now.

775,HoneyDewMoutain,1613961905,"I feel no one cares when I have a problem, when I want space, when I want to be left alone and when I just want to relax. It’s bad enough I have trouble relaxing and they make it harder just by doing the opposite of what I told them not to do, yell.

I take care of 3 dogs all by myself who bark constantly when alerted. At first I wasn’t annoyed because it was only when someone was at the door or when they needed to use the bathroom. What made me mad was only when this woman, a guest of my mom’s let her child keep knocking on my room door all the time to trigger them. And when it was open she would run in and provoke them to bark. I’m not mad at the child, what pissed me off is the carelessness of the adult to allow her child to keep doing it over and over again after I told her the situation! 

Keep in mind, I hear them bark everyday and will have to for the next 3 months. I have to keep an eye on them 24/7 so they won’t destroy the house. I can barely hear myself think or watch a show that calms me down when they do that. So to have that constantly happening on my last day off is more than enough!

Then tonight, my mom is yelling cuz my brothers pissed her off. I kept my cool and told her to stop. She didn’t right away, so I had to wait. Cuz of her yelling the dogs started barking again. After the yelling stopped and I silenced the dogs. Then, of all things that could happen the child knock on my door again. I yelled so much telling everyone to shut up and leave me alone repeatedly. I yelled and asked “why?” confused on after telling people I need silence they do the opposite! Then my mom got angry at me yelling and started yelling herself. I even yelled at the child’s mom in the same manner when she asked if I was okay.

The noise didn’t stop after that. I started to cry. My head that’s been aching all day wouldn’t stop throbbing. I was so frustrated I couldn’t think. It’s bad enough no one else wants to feed and take the dogs on a walk or do anything else around this house. So why can’t they let the person who cared enough to stop the dogs from destroying the house, that they never clean, relax?

Then they guilt trip me when I get angry and they make it about themselves. 

I feel awful because the lack of care. It’s like I’m not allowed to be tired or frustrated. Despite all the work I do and it makes me feel mad because I have no where else to go due to COVID. I don’t understand. I have anger issues, depression and anxiety that I’m trying to handle. I feel like my family likes to make me angry because they get pleasure by hearing me suffer so they keep doing it. Imagine your own family members telling you “I don’t care” about your mental health and whenever they trigger you they just poke fun at you about your mental health problems. Jabbing at you to “go back to the hospital.” 

I told them already I’ll handle my problems on my own with my therapist who I only get to see once every two weeks. So they don’t have to be bothered by me and yet they won’t leave me alone when I ask? But I have to leave them alone???

I just hate everything, I hate it all, I hate myself for being this way. I just wanted to relax so I can do my homework that’s due at 10 am tomorrow but I couldn’t even rest to let my migraine go away so I could focus on it. It’s 9pm for me right now so I’ll have to pull another all nighter cuz that’s the only chance where I’m allowed to take care of my own problems.

I haven’t left my bed. I just don’t want to move now cuz I’m animated, angry, upset and depressed right now. I just hate everything now! I don’t even want to attend school tomorrow but I have to. 
I guess that’s what I deserve for being ill. I feel like they’re laughing at me now because of my reaction I guess that’s what they wanted for me to panic and get angry again. Now every noise I hear even the subtitle ones is pissing me off. I don’t know what to do. I want to sleep but I can’t.

Basically I have anxiety and panic attacks well I haven’t had a full blown panic attack in a while which I’m proud of. I used to have 1 every. Single. Day. The worst experience of my entire life I would wish it on no one. I got help after a rocky ride the beginning for the panic attacks every single day for around 1-2~ years was my mother leaving me alone for almost a year. Mind you im a male so there’s the you’re a man act like one. You’re never supposed to show emotions ever blah blah blah. And that’s how I was for years. I didn’t even tell my mother or brother I loved them until I was 19/20. I’m in my 20s so back to the story that’s how it started and I got help worked for a few months while I was starting to feel normal again my mom decides to take another job that requires her to live there. Again I ended up back to where I started. Without making this post any longer. I went back to it and then she promised me she wouldn’t take another one of those jobs. Which she just did. And obviously I’m hurt and mad maybe I said things I shouldn’t have but when I was being calm and expressing my feelings she didnt care and even after being angry she didn’t care. Which instead of making anything better is making me panic. But what made it full blown worse is she calls my brother which I thought okay maybe he could be understanding or show some sort of sympathy because he has 3 children turns out no, I get blamed. They think my anxiety my panic attacks is like a broken bone. Yea it’ll heal in a certain amount of time. I think I’ve been going to my psychiatrist for about a year and a half. In that time I haven’t really had panic attacks all that often I usually try to take a pill right before it gets to that and go to sleep. So In my eyes I’m in a better state than where I was before that. But In their eyes there’s no improvement it’s my fault it’s the psychiatrist fault. Why aren’t I working. Why aren’t I being independent. Why am I secluded myself. Even after me expressing how angry and hurt and afraid they didn’t care. If anything he was making jokes saying I should get electro shock therapy and brushing me off like nothing. I even got so angry and hurt that I told him I’m gonna block him and he’ll lose me he brushed it off laughed and said I don’t care that’s life. Which fucking hurt me.

I have gad, sad, ocd and panic disorder. Have been diagnosed and put on anti-depressant 2 months ago, I finally succeed to stop ocd probably a month ago I am glad that I have did it and I will tell it to my psychologist the next time I see her. Before my diagnose it was horrible derealization, nostalgia, sadness, hopeless, mood swings every seconds, and more... I don't even have the words to describe the pain that I had some months ago. I stopped school cause it's just too much for me I never liked it and I want to work on internet which I have been working on for years and today I have partnership with companies. But since a week I feel something that is pretty painful. Not like and stomach pain or derealization but kind of loneliness. Just the want to have someone who can ear what I have to say and that is there just for talking or watching a nice movie or serie. I talk only to my dad in the week-end and sometimes to my mom when she comes prob like 5 mins per weeks. So I am alone the whole weeks, my psychologist told me to go outside at least 30 minutes but I just can't. I don't want to go outside but I begin to go outside times to times like 30 minutes a week and I hope that I will maybe more get out in some times but I feel great with 30 minutes/week. Anyways I feel lonely. I feel like I need someone just to hug.. not my dad, someone... a friend, a girlfriend idc someone that I love... and it's hard to live with that loneliness. I would not tell it's at the point of suicide but sometimes I just want to work on my projects and I fucking just can't cause I imagine if there will just be someone at end of the day to talk to and to watch a movie u know just someone...

i normally order on my phone and just go straight to pickup to save time and talking to people, but i had a new rewards card that i can’t use through mobile orders so i had to go in store and order in person. my mom was with me but she doesn’t want to order for me because she wants me to practice, on one hand i’m nervous because i’d have to do it myself but on the other hand i’m kinda relieved because her english is a bit broken (which is completely understandable because english is a second language for both of us), and i feel embarrassed for her when she makes a mistake. normally i would practice what i was going to say in my head while i’m in line, but for whatever reason that didn’t happen today, and i stumbled over my words when ordering at the counter. there was loud music playing and quite a few people in the store, so i couldn’t hear the staff very well and she couldn’t hear me very well, so there was some repeating and back and forth that made me feel even more nervous. to add on to that, not only did i completely blank out on the drink i’ve ordered so many times, i forgot to tell her my ice/sugar levels until she’s already checking us out, and i had to go back and tell her. she was nice and most likely laughed in a nice way, but i felt SO embarrassed and stupid for tripping over some simple words, especially when there were so many other customers there as well. 

on my way home i couldn’t stop these physical “tics” (i guess you can call it that?) that happen whenever i recall an embarrassing/anxiety inducing memory. i was in the car and i’d either clap or hit my leg really hard every few minutes, because my mind kept going back to how gloriously i fucked up in the store (the worker probably doesn’t even remember me anymore and this seems like a small thing but i’m gonna be replaying this in my head for the next 5 years). usually in public i can control them so i don’t make an even bigger fool out of myself, but when i’m at home, especially at night, i get these so often that i’d end up with bruises on my leg from involuntarily hitting it so hard.

This year however is hitting like gang busters.  My father has the beginnings of dementia, the company I work for has been sold and and my career is in jeopardy and we won't know the results until after April.  The people who's car I hit in a car accident 2.5 years ago (3 car pile up not including my car) are suing me, and I am in the process of fixing medications and getting some professional help for my PTSD disorders and adhd issues.

All of this has created a good bit of chaos in my life and I am trying to contain my mental stability.

I am a liberal.  I live in a red state and have been keeping my views mostly to myself because I don't feel it is necessary to argue with people who won't listen anyway.  My friend of over 20 years is a Conservative (sp?).  With the political climate we have now after what happened at the capitol building she is noticing for the first time people who have largely extreme right wing (violent IMHO ) views are being taken off social media.  She views this as a removal of their right to free speech. 

Personally, I don't care.  These are private companies who don't want to be responsible for the actions of people on their service and they have a right to kick them off.   But that is not the point of my post.  Sorry.

I can't handle her anger right now.  She won't accept that maybe I don't agree with her, and feels that I am just as bad when I tell her there is a reason I don't use my real name on anything online because I don't want to spend my life having to justify what I think.  I asked her nicely to please quit sending me articles about it.  Because I don't send her every article about every time I see a rapist get away with it, or heartbeat bills being passed, or anything else that would strip the freedoms from other people because I know she isn't interested.  

Two days ago, she sent me two more articles about people who are being kicked off or losing their jobs to being vocal in support of hate crimes.    I sent her two messages.  ""stop""  and ""Please"".   Yesterday I asked her if she was mad at me because she had not responded to my texts and she responded with ""I am not in a good place to talk to you right now.""

This pissed me off.  She has to my face called me a slut in so many words (because I am sexually active and have been  married before and am with my second husband.  She has had no serious relationship in her life and never been married, much less gotten someone she dated to last longer than three months)., she actually introduced me to her friend (my now husband) because he was on a 7 year drought and she thought I could end it for him. 

Anything you plan with her has to be set at her schedule.  And if you balk she always starts it with ""I can't help it if ....."" and some stupid reason why it has to go her way.   

But she isn't all bad.  She was there for my first divorce and fed me and help me through the tough times.  She is there at 3 am when I have a migraine that won't go away and they are calling for a brain scan and noone else is answering the phones, she was there after my car accident without hesitation.

Overall she is not a bad friend and to lose this would break my heart.

So, I guess after all this preamble.  How do I kill this anxiety I have over the feeling that she is angry with me for wanting personal space so I can deal with the crap I have going on?  I know she has the right to her space, but I think she is being silly right now.  

My husband says she is experiencing for the first time what I have experienced in  society for years and it is going to take her time to adjust. But I think she is just mad because she thinks that I don't respect her.  It is not that I don't respect her, I just have to take care of me.

I am about two breaths away from crawling under my bed and seeing if the world could go away for a while.

I don't want to argue about politics, I just want to understand why I can't let this go and let her breathe.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it.

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her.

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time.

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead.

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly?

I have a few health issues, so I study from home through an online college, so I can't really meet classmates because, well I don't have any.

I thought maybe asking some of my current friends to introduce me to some of their friends or letting me tag along if they're going out.

Idk if that's like super weird? I know that a lot of the time my friends don't invite me to social gatherings (again outside of lockdown) because they know I'm generally not comfortable around a lot of people because of my anxiety (when I was at my lowest about a year ago I pretty much told them that I hate parties and that I don't go to them so they eventually just stopped asking).

But I feel like I am getting better at handling my anxiety and I want to push myself a little and like go to parties and meet new people. 

I don't wanna just be like ""can I come with"" and make them feel obliged, but at the same time I'm like ""you don't ask, you don't get"" you know?? 
Generally if I ask to tag along to something (only ask like my bff) I'll just say like ""if you want I'd love to go. But don't feel obliged if u don't want me to come I won't be offended, just tell me to sod off"" and all my friends know that I'm very upfront so they know I'm being honest.

However, now that I have anxiety, when I try to restrict calories in any way, the combinations of mild lightheadedness and discomfort that I was used to now get morphed into the, ""Oh no, I'm dying"" of anxiety.

I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity.

I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy.

But, Benzos can also help me *a lot* if used as needed 3 to 5 times a week (Valium and Ativan I am most familiar with). Sleeping is great!

The upside is I can actually sleep when using benzos. Otherwise I almost always wake up 4 to 5 hours into my sleep waking up panicky/anxious and am unable to sleep. If I get up and take a benzo, I can get back to sleep quickly and have no hangover effect the next day, like every other sleep aid has (melatonin, benadryl, etc.).

I also don't want to take a daily anxiety medication, as my energy levels are already very low, and I don't need to be sedated 24/7 due to daily drugs/ssris on top of that. Anxiety medications are made to be sedating, obviously, to calm you down. Benzos will make you drowsy as well, but only for a few hours tops.

I do not have an addictive personality, and have never has any substance abuse issues. But again, I can understand why prescribers are very reluctant to supply you with benzos (although some are probably less reluctant than others)

832,Keaton427Theories,1613948772,I’ve had terrible anxiety for the last 3 days when before I’ve never been that anxious. 2 days ago I had a panic attack and I’ve been recently afraid I’d have a heart attack even though it’s just anxiety. I read symptoms of anxiety or heart attack and as soon as I read “pain in the left arm” I’ve started feeling uncomfortable on my left arm as opposed to right. I’m having chest pain near my right arm and can’t stop feeling anxious deep down.

It started with my boyfriend leaving for three weeks (he left on monday) and I missed him a lot, but eventually I coped with it and my mood was WAY better than I thought. I dealt with it much better than I imagined I would.  
Fast forward to wednesday, anxiety began to slowly set in. By Thursday, I've been spiraling and experiencing constant panic because of 1. being alone and having no one to talk to, and 2. missing him terribly. Even if I ""know"" in the back of my head that everything will turn out okay, it sure as fuck doesnt feel like it. My anxiety hasn't been this bad in YEARS.  
So, I've had multiple panic attacks from Thursday until today. I feel dizzy and fatigued, which is only making me spiral even more because I think I have a brain tumor or that something is seriously wrong with me. I'm experiencing derealization as well, which oddly enough I'm pretty okay with because I know it isn't dangerous. It's the physical symptoms that are freaking me out so bad right now.  Even as I'm typing this, fatigued as fuck and just wanting to sleep for a week, I still feel anxious because I'm anxious. Any help and tips right now are more than welcome.

838,littlelamb0814,1613948053,"We hear a lot about the difficulties of living with anxiety disorders, but I like to think about how amazing our strengths that tend to be a part of our character! Living with GAD myself, I felt tears of validation come to my eyes when I read this article I've linked below. It felt really good to consider those positives that come with being a person with severe anxiety, since I've struggled with it from early childhood.

Sometimes I feel so sad when I think about the little child I was, full of pain often, because of my anxiety. And I get sad about how many things I've missed out on and wish things could be easier for me like it seems to be for others. But then, there are also a lot of things about me that are wonderful, which are certainly influenced by the fact that I have GAD. I wish I could go back in time to child-me and give her a hug and tell her about how excellent she actually is, and that things will all be okay!

I hope anyone else who has ever felt that life with anxiety is difficult, sad, or disappointing, can also feel the reinvigoration in who you are as a person that comes from noticing those golden nuggets in yourself.

Here's to our courage, moderation, transcendence, curiosity, and kindness! You're doing great. &lt;3

I have had horrible anxiety for years and I have built a really bad addiction to marijuana over the years as well. Exactly a week ago was finally the breaking point, I said some really bad things and hid my relapse and that was finally the end. My anxiety has been though the roof and I have been extremely sad. I feel as though the weed mixed with my bad anxiety caused our relationship to fall apart, and it really sucks. She says we will probably not talk again for a long time but is rooting for me to get better but it really hurts, I would talk to her all day everyday and now I don’t really have anyone to talk to besides my mom, it’s been extremely hard.

I found this subreddit a few days ago because I couldn’t find a good way to cope with my lost relationship and the anxiety and sadness that followed it. Well, there have been a number of posts here that I have read and I realize that I am not alone, and it’s been comforting to me. I’m happy to say that I have not smoked weed in 5 days and tomorrow I will begin therapy to try and help my anxiety and addiction. I’m finally starting to get the drive to get out of bed and so some schoolwork and not just be sad all day. It’s been extremely hard and I know it is going to take time before things are somewhat normal again, but fuck man it’s been really hard.

I’ve had a rough past year due to deaths that took place in my life, along with other situations that have increased my anxiety. 

In the past I’m able to remember every sexual encounter I’ve had from the beginning to the end. 

I’ve been working out with a trainer for about a month and we would workout late and leave the gym pretty late as well while janitors were still in the building.

I always remember going into the restroom and having conversations in the parking lot to recap my training sessions and talking to janitors and security guards on the way out.

A family member brought up to me that the Coach could’ve been trying to groom me and described how the Coach was preparing to make a move soon and described sex vividly.

The thoughts from what she was telling me really creeped me out, now I’m having thoughts that what if something did occur in the restroom, however I do remember driving home each night perfectly fine and leaving the restroom, the thoughts and dream start in between entering the restroom and leaving.

Is this just a false memory/intrusive thought since I never saw the Coach in this way until after my family member described this explicit scenarios to me?

26y M. Alcohol free for 1 year, very mild caffiene user. Tobacco free..

I was diagnosed with anxiety about 18months ago. Anxiety started for me with a huge flare up of tachycardia after a night of heavy drinking on a day at work where I was to give an important presentation related to my career development. This transitioned into full blown panic attacks on 2 separate trips to Europe. Starting at the airport. Chest pain. Pounding fast heart beat (but in rhythm)..I went through the ringer with cardio testing. Holter, event, echo stress. All check out :)

I started therapy, and eventually lexapro in May 2020. I have been taking Lexapro for 10 months. My anxiety is really starting to improve for the most part except for 1 thing. PACs. They started a month ago. No obvious triggers. They feel like a thump, or flop in my chest. I have a Kardia Mobile 6L ekg at home and have documented these palpitations. (They show up pretty clearly on an EKG)  my cardiologist and my doctor both agree they are harmless. In the last month I have had, what I estimate to be hundreds per day some days, and I went a whole week without having any at all. I don't feel all that anxious..and haven't for quite some time.

I’ve been going to therapy since October and have recently been feeling great so I wanted to push myself to do things that make me anxious because I really miss living a “normal” life. I went out with my friend and had a great time, making sure I was being cautious due to COVID and using some breathing techniques and keeping my anxious thoughts in check. 

Unfortunately after I got home I had a couple panic attacks trying to go to bed. The stress from the day hit me all at once. I was exhausted and hungry so I had a snack and doodled a little on my iPad until I fell asleep. I was able to calm my thoughts and it was milder than my attacks that drove me to seek professional help (constant vomiting, hyperventilating) but I still got all the other symptoms out of no where and reminded me of how bad it feels and that I’m still not fully “recovered”. Today, while I feel better I’m just a little discouraged. My therapist is great with CBT but she hasn’t been able to give me much advice on exposure and how to work my way up to doing Normal Things again.

So I (28M) used to be quite toned and in prime condition, now I've wasted away and barely have muscle mass.

I worked up the courage to go to the gym, its only a small gym with basics, I live in a small town.

Well I went in and did a warm up and there was a group of guys at the weights. They see a skinny guy on the elliptical just doing my own thing. They just laugh and look over asif why would I use a stupid cardio machine, weakling.

I literally was shaking and left, I will never go to that gym again. Now the next closest gym in 80km away. I think I'll just stick to my home work outs.

I just wish EVERYONE would just STOP judging. Yes there is toxic masculinity and toxic feminity, but why do people not want the best for others. I hate how this world divides everyone into boxes.

866,Fancy-Camera-3554,1613941305,"Hello! 

I’m Tyler, as a few of you may already know. I’ve been hosting open sessions for people to pm me, to talk about their worries. 

On my past account (that I forgot the login to), I usually got about 4-5 upvotes on those “come talk” posts. 

My last one got 400.

Obviously, I don’t do this for karma. There are much easier ways than talking to someone for two hours lmao. But the upvotes, awards, and comments made me feel so appreciated. 

I currently have 44 chat requests from overnight, and 25 messages, as well. I’m working towards speaking to everyone, but it does take me a bit. I’m very sorry if you haven’t gotten a reply yet! I put all of my heart &amp; effort into these convos, because most people are very tired of hearing “chill out. It’s going to be fine. You’re just worrying over nothing.” 

!!— This does not mean to stop messaging me! I am still happy to answer any newcomers. This is a coping mechanism for me, and helps me through my healing process.—!!


It’s very difficult to talk to everybody at once, and sometimes there are emergencies concerning other chats. Please be patient &amp; forgiving with me! I’m very sorry! I stayed up for most of the night, chatting with many of you, and had to get up early. I promise that I’m working hard to speak to each of you. 

Every one of you deserves the time &amp; attention that I love to give you guys. You’re all worthy of support &amp; love. 

The award messages, comments, and more have given me more than you guys will ever know. I will absolutely be looking back on them, when I’m struggling again. 

I would like to update my requirements as well! 

-Your name, nickname, or part of your username that you would like to be called. (I don’t say it in every message or anything, but if I find myself needing to use it, it’s very awkward to ask halfway through.)

-your pronouns (this is optional. I from California, and use bro, man, dude, etc as pronouns for everybody. But I try to do it less for ppl who use she/her. Trans women have told me that it makes them uncomfortable, so that is why. If you are ok with dude/ bro/ whatever, you can totally leave it out.)

-Your current time or time zone! 

Just as a final note: please, PLEASE, do not feel bad for your language/ typing skills. Many of you have apologized over and over. I have had convos here using (my very limited &amp; basic level of) Russian, Japanese, and Spanish. I’m very familiar with broken English, Dyslexic typing, and more. I’ve even had to use translator apps for entire conversations. I may be an American, but I’m not that much of an asshole. I work in online commission, and am very used to varying types of conversations. Everyday, I take orders from clients who speak English as a second, third, or even fourth language. It’s okay! 1/4 messages I get are swamped with apologies over this!! It’s alright, I promise :)

868,frazzlednfreakin,1613940837," 

for the past half year or so, i’ve been dealing with crippling anxiety and substantial bouts of depression. both are nothing new to me, but the anxiety i encountered was by far the worst and most pronounced issue to deal with. 

it started off as a struggle to find a new job and new place to live in the midst of a pandemic. what followed was a casual love for caffeine (this ended up being a trigger for subsequent panic attacks) and an onset of....stress and uneasiness. i remember being in my room and waking up from a nap to brush my teeth. suddenly, my face and head (scalp?) went numb. i remember slapping myself out of fear that something very wrong was happening and hoping to reach a physical sensation that was familiar to me. from that point on, i have endured many triumphs and tribulations--have established myself in different homes and places of employment, while also having the privilege of meeting some of the most encouraging and stellar individuals. i had dealt with a continued fair share of panic attacks, seemingly brought on by situational fears, a lack of control, public spaces, or nothing at all. my panic attacks initially caused me to worry about my breathing and overall sense of dread, but then afterwards i plagued my mind with a fear of a brain tumor. there have been bouts of disassociation (yikes) and general head fogginess. as someone who has self-identified as a chronic worrier of health conditions, fixating on these things is nothing new to me, but has made me feel like i have even less control than what the past year warranted. 

i guess i'm typing this all to say that, despite the wonderful friends i have made throughout feeling this way, i just want to know that i'm not as abnormal or separated as my fears have led me to believe. i understand now there's a lot that needs to be processed, but i don't want to feel like i'm not able to grow as a person or that i have to succumb to these worries.",Anxiety,commenters are welcome!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lp6dic/commenters_are_welcome/,1613912037.0

Over the past 3/4 days I have felt filled with anxiety, restlessness, anger and suicidal thoughts. My sleep has been awful, struggling to get to and stay asleep. I just feel mentally out of control and mixed with my dysphoria, physically out of sync with my body.

Nothing seems to be going well and I don't know where to go. I thought I was doing well opening up about my gender dysphoria and anxiety to family and I began to feel better, but its all came crashing down again.

I don't really know what to say in this, I am struggling and typing this is just a way to delay action on these thoughts. I keep getting the urge to punc something: a desk, a wall and sometimes myself. I do it sometimes when it gets to much and although I regret it after it doesn't stop these urges developing again.

889,theorangeblonde,1613935349,"Oh my goodness, this will be long; tldr at the bottom. 


I (F27) have been taking medication off and on for anxiety and depression for almost 10 years. 


Some were horrible (shout out to Wellbutrin), some were average, and the best one so far was Pristiq (an SNRI). I started it in Dec 2017 at the 50mg dose, increased to 100mg 18 months later (summer 2019) and it did relatively well until life got crazy around July 2020.


That month I had two separate specialists tell me that physical symptoms I was experiencing were related to anxiety and there wasn't much they could do to help. I didn't realize how bad things were when I spoke to my Nurse Practitioner (NP) (primary) a month later, so I didn't mention the medication feeling stagnant.


Over the following 6 months (Aug 2020 - Jan 2021) life turned itself upside down a few times with family issues, moving, work being overwhelming, and postponing my wedding from Aug 2020 to Aug 2021. But I managed well enough. I was able to go to work each day (the last time I took a sick day was Oct 14 2020 and I am so proud of myself for that), and still was able to run the errands needed to keep the house running, keeping my cats and my fiancé happy. 


I was backsliding though with progress I had made with the support of therapy. I 'graduated' from my prior therapist after seeing her for 3.5 years, and had all the tools I needed to stay healthy. But it was really difficult to use those tools effectively when all I wanted to do to cope with the elevated stress levels was sleep or veg in front of the tv. Granted we couldn't do anything because of COVID-19 restrictions, but I would come home from work around 16:30, and then sleep from 17:00-21:00, be awake again until 23:00, and then back to bed with a 6:30 wake-up. All I did was go to work, come home and sleep, and occasionally go out to get essentials.


Finally after a series of exhausting events between the end of Jan and middle of Feb 2021, I had my NP set up a 6 month mental health checkup with me. They tried to reach out via email to get me to call the office to book, but I didn't have the energy when their office was open, or would forget until they were closed. Finally their medical receptionist called me about a prescription renewal and booked the appointment with me there and then. I cannot say enough good things about my primary health clinic - they are incredibly awesome.


During my appointment I ended up experiencing word vomit and went over the highlights from the last 6 months, and she agreed that my stress levels were a lot higher than they were before. I felt validated, it was so nice. Then she asked if I wanted to explore more medical options.


To tell you the truth, I didn't realize you could take multiple medications to support your mental illness because my prior family doctor only ever had me on one at a time. So when my NP suggested a few different options I really wanted to learn more about whatever medication that could keep me on Pristiq, since I like the way it helps my anxiety. She suggested an anti-psychotic. I stopped for a moment while all of the stereotypes ran through my head, then decided they didn't matter if they could help me. My NP asked if I had any questions about the stigma associated with them and I replied I'd rather feel better than how I am now.


So she faxed over the prescription for  Seroquel to my pharmacy, I picked it up on a weekend because it could cause drowsiness, and I took my first dose on Feb 13 2021. Last night I had to increase from the starting 25mg dose to 50mg and I CANNOT BELIEVE the difference I'm experiencing already.


On weekends I normally do nothing if I can help it. I like pot so I am usually waking and baking and watching tv or napping once I've had some food. Today, I took a tiny hit off my vape (really not enough to do anything to me), and I have been awake and alert since getting out of bed at 9:30. It's currently 14:00 ish and I just finished mopping my bathroom floor for the first time since we moved in (Nov 2020). Normally I wouldn't advertise that because shame is real, but I am just so damn excited that I have all of this energy.


And the best part is, I'm going to go finish cleaning the bathroom now instead of leaving it half finished for another month or two.


Im keeping my fingers crossed that this isn't an anomaly, and I will continue to have this amount of energy. I will keep working on my mental health in general, but work is officially settling down in March, and Spring will be here before we know it. Family drama has subsided, and though we have no clue whether we will have our wedding in August I am at peace with whatever happens.

I also have this feeling of not feeling real ( I can’t spell the actual term for it) and that’s not a lot of fun.

905,cedarpoet,1613930256,"Hi everyone,
The past few months have been absolutely hell. I’ve suffered with anxiety ever since I was 12- I’m very sensitive to people who shout ( it scares me and I start shaking) and I get very sensitive to sounds, materials. All that stuff, all of this came crushing down on me after a series of very traumatic events. Since I could remember, I’d get anxiety attack every time before I reached school, it was horrible, I couldn’t breathe. I told my mother about it but she passed it on as nervousness. Recently, it’s been getting worse. I moved countries last year and has been faced with bullying. My mental health and decreased gradually and my repressed trauma is taking a toll on me. I beg my mother for therapy, but she declines. Says no black child should receive therapy. I’m 16 now, and I all I can say is, I’m at my worst. When it comes to my mental health, there’s nothing I can say. I’ve never had evaluation for my mental issues but I fully know I suffer with adhd,ptsd, bpd and depression (and depersonalization issues) among other. I also hallucinate. Unfortunately, my mom doesn’t believe me, she says I look perfectly fine and happy, she doesn’t understand my need for meditation and therapy. I hate it. It takes a lot to not think about suicide. 

Lately, the past few weeks. I’ve been experiencing my anxiety attacks multiple times a day. 3-7 times, and it becomes hard to concentrate and stay present. I tell my mom and she says I should pray.,.,., sigh. I have the mind of a child, in a sense. I can’t remember anything most times. It gets in the way of doing school work or anything in general. I get heavily anxious when doing schoolwork. There’s pressure of still having to be the “golden child” I hate it.

How do I tell my parents I need psychiatric evaluation and medication? I’m getting tired day by day. I don’t know what mental issues I suffer from.....

906,floppyrock,1613929776,"Hi everyone. Like the title indicates, I am a senior (23F) at a small college in the U.S. I spent the past two semesters at home with my parents doing remote learning, and I returned to campus for my last semester of school. I've been here for a week now. Unfortunately, I am feeling extremely depressed and anxious, as well as incredibly homesick. I have a history of anxiety and depression, as well as panic disorder (I am currently medicated and seeing a therapist weekly). It is usually well-managed, but the past week I've cried multiple times a day, and I am just riddled with feelings of anxiety and panic throughout the day. I keep thinking about how long there is left in the semester, dreading the fact that my parents can't visit me or see me graduate due to restrictions, obsessing over feeling ""stuck"" on campus because I can't leave to visit home, feeling guilty for being away from them, literally counting down the days (it's 97 today lol) until I can leave.

As it has been for everyone, this last year has been incredibly hard on my family and me. We experienced several deaths in the family, and are dealing with the effects of social isolation. We definitely leaned on each other throughout this past year, especially since we weren't really seeing anyone else due to isolating within our house. Because of this, I feel especially attached to my parents now. Being away from campus for so long (11 months) led me to get accustomed to life without college, and now it kind of feels like I've reopened a wound. It doesn't really feel like home at all anymore. I have been hanging out with friends (according to COVID-safe guidelines), FaceTiming family, going on walks, doing yoga, and seeing my therapist, but I am still just riddled with this horrible anxiety and feelings of wanting to get out of here and go home. I also feel embarrassed and ashamed because I feel like I should be past this, I'm too old to feel like this, I'm not a freshman, etc.

All this said, I really do want to enjoy this last semester of college and try to make the best of it despite all the strange circumstances. I want to spend time with friends and teachers who I love, and hang out at all my favorite spots on campus. Still, this obsessive thought about missing home and wanting to leave won't go away. Do any of you have some guidance or wisdom on how to best do this -- how to live in the moment without thinking about what you are missing, or counting down the days until it is over? Any words of advice, big or small, are so appreciated. Thank you.

913,redubshank,1613927085,"Hiyo,  I want to start off by saying all of our situations are unique and I am not providing solutions that work for everyone but they worked for me so if you are struggling they might be worth looking into.  I won't list everything I tried because I am almost 40 and have been dealing with this stuff since I was a young teen.  My memory isn't that good and I think this post might already get too long.

Quick about me: I'm 38.  Been dealing with depression and general anxiety since I was about 13-14.  The severity would change over time to the point I felt basically normal and at it's worst, while dealing with a chronic pain condition, I was locked up on suicide watch.  


I'm not listing things in any order.

**Cutting out stimulants**  
So, when i was a teen or low 20s I could drink an entire pot of coffee and fall asleep an hour later.  Then in my late 20s I noticed sleep issues and had to cut off caffeine by 6pm.  Then a few years later I made it 2pm.  And then noon.  And then 10am.  I say this so people understand over time your body reacts differently to drugs.  If you still don't believe me anyone over 30 probably knows that in their early 20s they could go out drinking and the next day, after a greasy breakfast, they were more or less fine.  As you get older a hangover can last 2 full days easily.  Anyways, I bring this up because people get very defensive about their caffeine since it is an addictive drug :).

So cut to the chase, I had to cut out caffeine due to a chronic pain condition.  I eventually added it back in and noticed a sharp increase in my anxiety issues.  I cut it back out and the anxiety issues lowered/disappeared.  I really feel anyone with anxiety issues should try cutting out caffeine for weeks if not months.  Worst case you give your body a much needed break from caffeine.  Best guess you found a possible solution.  You don't have to stay off it forever.  You can slowly add it back in and maybe find an appropriate limit.    


**Paradoxical relaxation/meditation**

I was never a fan of meditation.  I always left me frustrated and felt like a chore so I never stuck with it.  That was until I stumbled across paradoxical relaxation.  They are careful not to use the word meditation but really is a type of meditation.  It involves slowly relaxing your body from head to toe while in a comfortable position.  I tried it to help with the chronic pain and it was a huge help both with that and anxiety.  The relief at first was a so profound it was a physical sensation.  Since I was in such a bad place at the time sometimes I'd do it for like 2 hours but these days I do it in 15 minute sessions a couple times a week.  The after-effects aren't as pronounced anymore, which is to be expected, but I find still provides relaxation and a strong mental clarity.  Additionally, I can kind of use paradoxical relaxation on the fly.  Something stressful comes up at work?  The body starts tensing up maybe in the forehead, shoulder and around the eyes.  Being able to quickly do a body scan and relax those body parts helps A LOT.

The other meditations can work as well but for me personally paradoxical relaxation was the game changer for me... probably because for the most part you are actually doing something instead of trying to follow a mantra or keep your mind empty(though you want to keep your mind on track during PR as well).    


**Psycadelic/MDMA therapy**

Alright, I am going to be careful here.  Aside from trying pot in high school a few times I have been a straight laced software engineer for most of my life.  After having traditional medical help fail me so poorly I started looking for other solutions and found that people using magic mushrooms and MDMA in the right setting and intentions were having life changing results.  MDMA is being used to treat PTSD and after a few sessions 76% of folks who underwent treatment no longer met the criteria for PTSD.  It's been so effective they are rushing it through the FDA trials here in the USA.  Additionally, psycadelic have been used as a therapy/spiritual tool for literally thousands of years with some evidence showing it predates written history by a large margin.  Basically I am trying to get around the idea that all drugs are bad or that I am pushing people to use drugs.  What I am saying is that some non-addictive, mind-altering substances and safe substances can be used as a healing tool and I encourage everyone to research it themselves and come to their own conclusions.  Is that enough of a disclaimer?  


Anyways, again I was desperate for help and traditional modern medicine failed me so I tried psilocybin mushrooms. This is illegal here in the US and you can't find a legal therapist to do it with so you are kind of stuck solo.  MDMA therapist are a thing but hard to find at this time.  Anyways. This was a game changer.  It literally changed my life.  My wife couldn't believe the rapid changes see saw in me.  It was actually overwhelming and I got a therapist who specializes integration therapy.  She can't do sessions with me but if I choose to do them on my own we can analyze what I learn and how to implement them as positive changes.  I had tried over 20 mental meds.  I have worked with at least 6 therapists and none of it worked until this.  I'm such a big believer in it I donate money to MAPS( Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) and invest in a company working on bringing psilocybin as a therapy tool to the public.  This was mostly to treat depression but since anxiety and depression are so closely linked I think it has helped both.    


I have recently started doing MDMA therapy as a way to sort of heal the scar tissue from 25+ years of depression and anxiety and the results from that have been profound as well.... but I want to be very clear here.  These aren't typical medicines.  It's not an SSRI you can just take and assume it's fixing stuff.  You do them 3-6 times a year tops and then the hard part come which is implementing the changes into your life. I couldn't list all the changes I have made and they wouldn't be really relevant to you but the big take away is these are medicines that can open up some doors in your mind.  When you are sober you get to choose if you want to walk through them.

915,SnowBun9968,1613926940,"I'm not sure if this is OCD, but I (19F) have been dealing with intrusive thoughts for almost 6 months now. They are somewhat similar to POCD, but I get gruesome intrusive images of men abusing children (it is never me), and I also get intrusive thoughts like ""what if she is being abused"" and ""what if that father is a pedophile who is abusing his child?"". I think I have these thoughts because I absolutely detest and fear child sexual abuse, more than any other act in this world. The thoughts are distressing, but I have been able to use online resources and tips in order to decrease the amount of thoughts. 

Lately though, I have been worrying over the 'groinal response', which is debilitating. I could tell immediately that it was not arousal. And it usually doesn't happen at the moment of the intrusive thought, it happens while I am ruminating and when my anxiety is at its peak. I can tell that this truly doesn't mean anything because of the fact that it just happens when I am super anxious. I could be watching a tv show involving nothing sexual, and get a groinal response due to anxiety. Though, whether I am anxious about being aroused by the gore in the show, I dont know. 

I think one of my fears, that lines up with POCD, is that I would EVER be attracted to any form of sexual child abuse. Because I used to watch shota as a child and read inappropriate underage fanfiction, this fear has somewhat tangible evidence. Even though I was the same age as the characters, it still disturbs me. I know for a  FACT that I have no interest in children, and that I never have (I am attracted to men at least 5 years older then me). This groinal response has me questioning though ""why would I have this if I did not fear being aroused by children?"" . ""Even though this technically doesn't mean anything, does the groinal response indicate that I think I am a pedophile?""  It is confusing, but I guess my fear isn't that I am a pedophile (because I'm not). I actually fear the possibility of me fearing that I am a pedophile... sorry if that makes no sense.

**I kind of deviated from the main point, but I think the root of all my fear, is from fear of judgment. I constantly worry like ""oh god, I had another groinal response. How will I ever explain this to my future partner?"" I even go as far as to play out scenarios in my head, where I try to detail my problems to people. I just find it hard to stop thinking about others opinions. I feel like if I were to describe my issues like I did above, so many people would think I am a horrible person. I dont want to be a bad person. But going through all this (the intrusice thoughts, grounal response, etc.) I feel like the scum of the earth. Like, even if it was due to anxiety and nothing more, who would ever get a feeling down there when ruminating about child sexual abuse?? I want to be done with this, and hopefully I will get better with the help of my new therapist. But this constant fear of what other people think is ruining me. I want to have lasting relationships, and feel like I deserve them. I want to find love, and have good friends. But I feel like I will never deserve it, even after I eventually get through this. If anyone has any advice or success in this department, please let me know. I know deep down that I am not technically a bad person, because bad people do bad things without worrying about being bad. But it is hard to accept that these intrusive thoughts paired with the groinal response does not make me a disgustingly vile person. I think I would be able to explain the intrusive thoughts to my friends and partner. But the groinal response??? Who would ever accept me and my past...**

Sometimes I cant even watch a tv show because my brain will be like ""See that main character you like, and aspire to be? You could never be him/her. Everyone in that show would think you are disgusting and would hate you on the spot."" Or , ""See that villain? Who is literally burning an entire city down? You are far far worse then him. He is an angel compared to you and your thoughts."" It might be a little exaggerated, but it can be like this when I am having a particular day (like today). I hate it.

917,greenappletree,1613926795,"I wanted to share my thoughts on this and know if anyone else have similar experiences? 

I have anxious thoughts sometimes, however most of the day I'm fine, meaning I don't generally dwell on anxious thought, at least I try not too.  On somedays I could be perfectly fine, happy even, then I start to have a hard time breathing, and lately feeling a bit lightheaded, in other words I can feel gut wrenching anxiety without consciously being anxious/depressed or worry.  Went to check with my doc and got a clean health report! This has always baffle for for years, how I can just feel anxiety sensations but not experience anxious thoughts?  Its a bit frustrating because I'm looking at certain strategy including supplements and they don't work for me because my mind is relatively calm already when I feel those symptoms.  I don't even have a trigger, that I know off, that I can even avoid or begin to treat! 

I stumble on something interesting last night while attending a virtual course on anxiety, in there the instructor suggested that it is indeed possible to feel anxious sensation without being consciously anxious.  Its too bad she sort of just left at that but it got me thinking that this! 

Here are my thoughts on this.   My hypothesis is that is that there really is still a deep seated anxious trigger somewhere but its harder to figure out because there is no obvious trigger, say being scared of spider or a trigger thought (  I'm going to die kind of thoughts). Instead I think there may be a subroutine that triggers it.  A silly example could be, say when you are working and you type certain words, and even if you don't know it triggers and anxious sensation.  ***Think of it as a non-sexual kink and that the result is not arousal but anxiety symptoms***.  If you are lucky, you can pin point to a few of these subroutine, however because there are literal thousands if not million of subroutine ( both external and internal) that we do each day, and not to mention that there could be clusters/combinations of subroutines that can trigger the same responses, finding the correct ones could be near impossible.  

Anyways my temporary solution is this. I have a timer ( insight timer ) that has  a pleasant wood knock that triggers about every 3-5 mins.  so as I go about my day, when I hear that, I have to do something, anything that can reduce my anxiety, preferably something less than a second to do and does not distract what I'm doing.    

For example in my last few 3 min blocks ( one click every 3 mins )  I did the following, literally stuck my tongue haha, 1 deep breath,  picture something funny, smile, bite up and down as if I'm a big fish trying to scare a shark, saying ohm out load, laughing out load, hug myself, clapping, all tasks literally taking less than a second to do without distracting from what I'm doing. 

I'm hoping that by doing these set if ""distractions"" every few minutes I  will eventually catch some of the subroutine and break its output.  This could be tested because I can log each day how I feel starting today!  Wish me luck.

923,PewSmagoo,1613923571,"2 years of therapy.  Countless hours of growth and repair, and all it took was one small unrelated post on Facebook to bring me right back into the trauma.  My active imagination is great for my job but terrible for my health when I'm anxious.  Like the title says, when really I fear something, it can become so vivid that I see it coming true inside my head, I live through it, like I'm watching a movie play that I can't shut off.  I've had secret, complete arguments with people in my head before ever addressing them about a conflict in reality, so little beknown to them, we've already argued, yelled, maybe I've cried, resented their actions, all in my imagination before we've even come to it.  I've let them, or a conflict they're involved in, traumatize me before it even has a chance to occur, and that in of itself changes my mood or approach to the point that I may make the fear come true.

Been having anxiety about some stuff at work.  It should be something positive, but the open  ""it will be soon"" just hit a really raw trigger for me.  I went into a tailspin because it all started playing out in my head.  I inquire, I get a response, we argue.  I'm given an ultimatum, they tell me that I should quit.  Before I know it, I'm now at another place of employment (still in my head, mind you), interviewing, they're asking me questions, I'm telling them why I'm here and why I left my other place of employment, I've done an exit interview at the other place, I can hear myself saying the words and feeling the hurt... and it just keeps going until I'm entrenched and it's so hard to pull out of that nosedive.  

It's almost become real at this point, and now I'm in an even worse spot: do I really feel that upset from things that are *actually* occurring?  Or do I only feel like I do because of what I *imagined* someone saying or doing?  Now I have to ignore it all, pretend it didn't happen (because it didn't) and move forward, but I've watched the movie play, I know it's possible.

So for about 5 or 6 years I had been taking 1mg klonopin (.5 2x day, morning + night) as prescribed. Every once in a while I'd take an extra .5, not often. Maybe once a month on average.

I tapered down to .25mg in the mornings beginning of last year, and I had headaches for a week or two maybe but other than that was mostly fine.

Recently my doc and I decided to taper down again in the mornings, to not taking anything, and then continue .5mg at nights. It's been a little over 2 weeks now. The problem is I feel like I'm having anxiety throughout the day now. It's mostly physical anxiety, so like little bit of a fast heartrate, shaking hands, maybe some GI stuff as a result of that but I also have IBS so idk. I've also got some headaches and feel kinda groggy.

Does this seem normal? I can't find much good information on withdrawal symptoms on clonazepam online in terms of symptoms and timelines. Was wondering if anyone here had similar experiences of thoughts since I took it for anxiety in the first place. Does this seem like a normal, kinda rebound side effect?

My hypothesis is that because I was still taking .25mg in the mornings, albeit really small, it was still \*something\* so my anxiety was kind kept in check with that. But now since I'm taking \*nothing\* in the mornings, it's been rougher because of that even though it's the same amount of taper as last time.

I tried to hold it down but it didn't stop and there were tears in eyes. I wasn't able to stand still. I sat on the sofa. pretending to be fine and confused why I was shaking. we continued the conversation and eventually my shaking stopped and I was normal. now when I think of it.

939,GoingUnderBackwards,1613918663,"I adopted two cats on the 31st of 2020. As for everyone, it was a rough year. Little did I know, 2021 would be worse.

When I got my cats, I got a clean bill of health from the free vet visit. But I noticed that I had started getting spots on me that looked somewhat like ringworm, and both my cats had patches of scabs and such. I thought it may have just been from their eyeball removals before I got them. Then I got the spots on me and wasn't too sure. Made an appointment with a vet who was extremely difficult to get in with. He did nothing and told me if it was ringworm that it would probably just go away on its own. My dermatologist said the spots I have are pityriasis rosea. 

I made another appointment and they actually took ringworm tests, telling me it would take two weeks to confirm negative but a positive would likely show in a few days. I haven't heard for a week so I figure everything must be fine. Well, today I noticed one of my guinea pigs has a quarter sized irritated red bald dry spot on her back. No longer convinced that this isn't ringworm and I have now stupidly given it to all of my pets. I just don't know what to do. I made yet another appointment but this is getting so expensive and I really can't handle this stress. My mom makes it worse by telling me to just give the cats back but I don't feel like that is the correct course of action and she doesn't care.

I keep getting rejected for promotions at work and this last one really hurt. I told my mom yesterday that I'm probably a trans masc and she didn't like that, all over the fact that I called my new haircut on facebook handsome. My apartment is a wreck.

942,TurbulentNebula27,1613915447,"Hey all, I'm an American living abroad in Asia. I started feeling anxiety a few years ago after a trip to Thailand spontaneously. My biggest symptoms were: fear of public transportation and public spaces/ fear of throwing up in public/ flying (which is a new one). Mostly my anxiety revolves around an upset stomach which in turn leads to a fear of throwing up wherever I am (although this has never happened). Anyway, I've tried several attempts at treatment with medicine and therapy but never felt like the doctors abroad cared much about my progress and rather were throwing random chemicals at my problems. I stopped taking medicines for the past year and my anxiety has slowly gotten better. I no longer live in total fear about going places and doing things like I once did. I am able to take transportation (still slightly uncomfortably) but have been making more attempts to do so. 

Nowadays, the symptoms that bother me are a fear of a heart attack due to strange uncomfortabilities in my chest and occasionally my arm. I don't think they are even in my heart, most likely in my chest muscles. This causes a fear of being alone for extended periods of time in case I... die, even though unlikely since I'm only 32 and pretty healthy. 

Sexual related question- I'm in a strong committed relationship with a very sweet supportive girl. However, over the past few years I realize that it can frequently become difficult for me to ""finish"". I can, it just takes forever, both when alone and with my partner. This has added some stress for myself in my relationship. I don't have any problems getting an erection but sometimes I feel that internal anxiety (as in nothing is on my mind but the overall effects are still affecting me) plays a part in this. I think that I'm not as hard as I should be which may make it difficult to finish. IDK, I could use any advice in this area too.

The question I need to ask the community is this... Am I doing myself a disservice by taking a hard stance against medicines, even though I've made progress without? Should I be working with a psychologist or phychiatrist? I'm living alone in a foreign country and it can be difficult to find suitable English speaking help but desperately want to resume ""normal life"".

948,zoleexl,1613911631,"Disclaimer: I’m not a medical professional, nor a psychotherapist, just someone who struggles with normal everyday functioning and in the rare moments when I find something helpful I share with others 

My life has been distilled down to the bare necessities (eating a minimal amount of food, going to a job where I can barely make any progress, avoiding relatives and old friends, I guess you can call it depression, but there is a lack of hopelessness, only a feeling of living in a limbo and mental, physical weakness and emotional numbness. As I was procrastinating shaving my beard, cleaning my apartment, making a amount of food and doing the laundry. I popped in 2 mgs of Clonazepam to sleep away the afternoon. The sleep ended after only an hour, so I decided to shave my beard, vacuum and eat (the laundry I did before). During the whole ordeal I felt sluggish and sleepy, but something made me do those things. 

I believe it would be logical to think that when you’re depressed, you don’t want to engage in anything because you’re sick of the lifeless manner in which you do them and you get negative feedback mental notes which give rise to anxiety about the future. “How will you survive if you struggle with even simple things like this”? Benzodiazepines, or downers in general take away this focus on the future. So when you do something under the influence of these substances, as badly as always (you don’t become more functional), you don’t project the consequences into the future, so you actually get things done with good results. It takes away the future worry based on possible scenarios, all of which you would probably fail, based on your condition and history, so you can just focus on the task.

Maybe this is what makes benzos and anti-anxiety medications so appealing, not only for managing anxiety but for depression also. Keep in mind that anyone’s problems with depression, anxiety or other issues can take many forms and probably are on a spectrum. 

TL;DR: Depression, being debilitating, makes you anxious about taking on responsibilities and tasks.

Of course it’s her body and so I don’t want to stand in the way of her doing what she wants, even if it isn’t things I like. But I can seem to deal with the idea of her changing herself even in just a small way.

I love her more than anything but I’m struggling to deal with her wanting these changes and I’m worried it will end the relationship. Of course I don’t want that and so here I am seeing if Reddit has any suggestions for me :) 

If people need more information I can reply to them with that or edit the post if it’s needed.

hello, as you saw from the title that is a genuine fear of mine and I was hoping if I could get some advice to overcome those fears. I would just like to disclose that in the few romantic relationships I've been in I have never been cheated on but I do have several theory's on why I have developed this fear.

1. this happened when I was 16 and I was dating this girl for about 2-3 months. I met her through a friend of mine and we started going out about 2 days after we met and at the time I thought things were going well until one day I showed up at the spot we usually hung out at and she was ignoring me and not talking to me, when I left and I was walking home she called me and dumped me for reasons that I didn't know until about 8 months later. after she dumped me I tried to maintain a good relationship with her because I still wanted to be friends with her. fast forward 8 months and she announces on a video call with me and my friend (who introduced me to her) the they were together, I remember being happy for them because I had moved on from her at that point but what really fucked with me is what happened a few days later when her and I were video chatting together and I jokingly asked ""how long were you crushing on him (my friend)"" and she said ""three years"" so I then asked ""even when we were dating?"" and she says ""\*gigges\* the only reason I dated you was to get closer to him"" when she said that I felt like I was going to cry and I even cut myself that night because of how distraught I felt when she said that. but shortly after my friend dumped her for his own reasons and both of us haven't spoken to her since.
2. the majority of the girls that I have had sex with only did it with me just to get closer to my friend (the same one from before).

anyways I think the reasons that I have listed may have just added more fuel to the fire to an already present phobia that I have had for as long as i can remember and I have noticed it only getting worse as the years go on, for example: if i ever go on a website like R34 and i stumble across a comic where a man is getting cucked I genuinely feel like crying (and sometimes I do) and i start having nightmares about me being in a relationship and my girlfriend cheating on me because i'm not a good enough boyfriend.

anyways thank you for reading this and I would apricate any advice for conquering this shitty fear of mine - Jord",Anxiety,I'm incredibly scared that if I get into a relationship with someone that they will cheat on me for not being good enough.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lotz03/im_incredibly_scared_that_if_i_get_into_a/,1613872772.0

My brother and mom were home and it’s a small apartment so I told them that if it smelled like anything they should leave but I made sure to open up a lot of windows. I left to go to an urgent care to make sure everything was ok but the doctor wasn’t there so the other people there told me it was fine and just to open up all the windows (which I had done) as nothing was going to happen.

974,Lunairi,1613900681,"Hello :) I would like to get some insights on whether or not I have an anxiety disorder.

My biggest concern is intrusive thoughts. It’s always about “something bad MIGHT happen to my [insert loved one].” The most recent occurrence was brought about dreams. Yes, it is as stupid as it sounds. One night I dreamt that a doctor told my boyfriend he had but 5 years to live. A few days prior, boyfriend told me he dreamt of dying in a plane crash (that’s one of the top things that he’s afraid of). Yesterday he told me that ever since his grandma died a couple of months ago, he keeps having dreams about death - like his grandma (or gravedigger) telling him to get into a casket/grave to check if it fits... now, I don’t believe in prophetic dreams, but all these coincidences brought about another bout of anxious thoughts in me. I don’t feel physical symptoms of anxiety, it’s purely psychological discomfort and inability to reason irrational thoughts away. I have a major problem letting go of thoughts about things that I have absolutely no control of. For example, it makes me anxious that I can’t decide that me and my boyfriend will always be healthy and will grow old together, unless we decide to go our separate ways.

The psychological discomfort comes and goes throughout a day because it slips from my mind momentarily only to reemerge again. Judging from my previous experiences, it should go away in a couple of days, but it still causes distress in me. 

Just to add, I have no trouble falling asleep, I don’t experience any chills, shortness of breath or chest pains. Though throughout my life I have often experienced pain in the chest, and no matter how many times I had doctors check me, there was nothing physically wrong with my heart. The only times I get the feeling of dread and impeding doom, numbness and fainting is when I injure myself or believe there’s something  wrong with my body. From the top of my head - I can never sit still, I very jumpy even when I think I’m relaxed, and I can’t control my tears when arguing with someone or when I have to talk about my feelings. Not sure if these are relevant.

This has happened to me a couple of times now where I'll be speaking with a girl, but as soon as her feelings seem reciprocal, I tend to back off a lot from the person and my anxiety almost prevents me from progressing. I've come to realise that these two situations were better of ending the way they were since both people weren't who I first thought they were. I know I can have commitment to one person in a relationship, but I also struggle to connect with people, if that makes sense.

Does anyone have any advice on how a person with anxiety can progress into a relationship with someone. I know I haven't found ""the one"" yet because I haven't ever felt comfortable to talk to previous crushes about my anxiety, and worry that if I do, they will walk away. I feel like I'm always falling for the wrong people which knocks my self-esteem, making me think that my anxiety is to blame for me never getting into a relationship.

I know this is a long post, and it probably means nothing at all. If you've been through something similar to me, can you advise me in some way as to what to do?

980,mcwhoredick,1613897732,"Lately my anxiety has gotten so bad to a point where I don’t know if it’s ever been this bad. Around Christmas ago I cut off a friend for toxic behavior and ever since then I’ve noticed myself spiraling deeper and deeper into a hole of anxiety. Before that I never really thought about death or dying but now it consumes my mind every day. It’s so tiring and I don’t really know what triggered it. 

I think about myself dying and I get the worst panic attacks but then I also think about my loved ones and pets dying and get anxiety about that too because I don’t think I’ll know how to handle it when it happens. A lot of the times I mourn them like they’re already dead even though they’re right here with me. Beyond that I get so anxious thinking about what existence is even. I constantly ponder what life is about, why I am who I, if there’s an afterlife, and if I’m supposed to be doing what I’m doing. 

I feel so lost lately and it’s making me so anxious. I think about the future and it makes me so anxious and panicky. Today I’ve been physically shaking because I keep thinking about the death of my loved ones and myself and the end of reality and I can’t handle it, no matter what I do I can’t break myself away from this cycle of anxious thoughts. I’ve asked some of my friends what I should do and they just tell me to distract myself but it’s nearly impossible as I’m constantly consumed by anxiety. 

When I try to distract myself I feel like it’s all so pointless. I think “What is the point of life if just to die?” And then I get anxious because I’m not living my life to my full potential and everything feels so wasted. I’ve lost interest in almost everything because of this, I just don’t see a point in doing things if it’s all for nothing. I’m struggling so hard to get motivated for school because of this. I just have no interest in doing anything like that and it’s so hard for me. 

This constant stream of anxious thoughts about what life is and what death is has made me become so distant from everyone in my life. I only really have four good friends and two of them have kind of been MIA for weeks and I’ve kinda lost my whole support system. I have such a hard time talking about this to anyone because I feel like I’m trapped. I feel like I’m the only person who has fears like this. 

I look at other people and wonder how they can be so carefree and not constantly think about death and existence and their fleeting time here. I just can’t find joy in the little things in life because of how consumed I am. I just feel so disconnected from everyone and from reality. I feel spaced out my whole work shift every day and then I come home and attempt to do school work and I can barely make it though assignments without crying because of how much I feel like I’m wasting my time doing menial tasks all day and then repeating it day after day. 

I’ve been watching a lot of impartial jokers lately to distract myself because it usually makes me laugh and I’ve been seeing the people on there that they prank just out living their lives (Pre-Covid) and it makes me feel so jealous. I see people just sitting in parks, going to restaurants and stuff and I feel so depressed because I can’t do any of that. I just feel like I’ve been wasting so much time because of the pandemic and I wish I could get outside and do anything because my anxiety has been heightened since the beginning of the pandemic, as I bet many people’s is. 

I’ve been trying to figure out what triggered my anxiety so bad a few months ago. I don’t know if it was losing a close friend and realizing how truly alone I am or if it was because I had corona around the same time and I was thinking about how fragile and mortal everyone is around me. It’s been so tiring for the last two months feeling so disconnected from everyone and constantly thinking about death. 

It also doesn’t help that my sleep has suffered so much because of my anxiety. Most days I sleep for a few hours, wake up and can’t go back to sleep because I’m consumed by existentialism. Other days I can’t go to sleep because I’m terrified that if I close my eyes and go to sleep I’ll never open them again. Recently my doctor increased my sleeping pill and it helped for a bit but I’m back to being unable to fall asleep and stay asleep because of this terrible anxiety.

I bought a custom cosplay of a DnD char from a guy who ended up being a complete psycho. This guy is really cool, and nice at first... but when you get to know him, he shows his manipulative, aggressive, toxic side. I didn’t realize that in the cosplay community he has a track record of being a dick, but at the same time he is extremely popular (idk why it works like that.)

During the ordering process he was condescending, and began gossiping about me and making fun of me and saying really awful things to other people. I was pretty floored that he acted like that.

I feel like I am anxious to wear it in public because I don’t want him to see me and somehow feel like he has power over me because he made my costume. I feel like I am beholden to him somehow.

The fact that I have to get up every day, do shit, eat, look after myself, be anxious about going out, dreading panic attacks, feeling as if I am under insane amounts of pressure to do ""fun"" things outside, it's just, too much? 

Oh, and I constantly think about death. Not suicide, but the actual concept of death and the fact that I will lose everyone eventually to it. I obsess over it and it's consuming me. And there is nothing I can do about it because I can not stop death from happening? It's inevitable, so what can I do about it? I will never be able to commit suicide, because I am too scared of death, so I feel incredibly hopeless and stuck in my own mind. Guys, this is scary shit and I am terrified.

1002,plsdontinsultme,1613890707,"Dating Q - will try to keep short. For the main “question,” scroll to where It says a) b) d) c)

I was pulled into a relationship by an attractive, kind, and like-minded person. Great match for me, made me feel desired &amp; happy. 

Talked for 2wk. Very long convos into late night, a lot of sex talk, etc. During this period she let me know she had severe depression and anxiety. Sometimes, she said, she’d not reply to anyone until 4AM b/c of it.

So we FaceTime twice. On FaceTime, she says she wants to date - to which I happily agree. 

We eventually meet up. It went very well - we related to each other, we laughed a lot, and just vibed amazingly. At one point she complimented my “vibe,” saying it was “amazing” - aka she felt comfortable around me. 

During this meeting, she made 2-3 comments that directly indicated we would continue dating / talking. 

It got sexual at the end - but we both expected that. No sex, but def very sexual. She and I both enjoyed that aspect very much. 

As I’m leaving, she says it was nice to meet me, I say likewise, as if she wants to again sometime - she says yes. 

I text two days later seeing what she was up to the next weekend. No reply. Text 3 days after, just to say hi. Nothing. Text 3 days later like “everything okay?”, nothing. 

So, that makes a full week of no reply. I conclude I have been ghosted. Absolutely crushing. Convince myself it was about me, &amp; that she didn’t like me. 

After another week, I send a kind text saying whatever happened (lost interest, is seeing someone, etc.) that I understood and respected it, and that it was totally fine. I told her if she ever wanted to talk or re connect, I’d be happy to. 

3 days after that, I get a reply. She apologizes for not answering. She said she was sorry, and that for a while after we met - she felt “uncomfortable / shy” about it, maybe b/c she wasn’t used to it moving fast like that (keep in mind: she initiated the relationship). 

I told her it was totally fine. No worries at all, I completely empathize. Apologized if it was my fault. Told her that when she feels ready, to let me know what she thinks about going forward. 

Now, it’s been days since I sent that..... and I am a combination of crushed, shocked, confused, and self-loathing tbh. I’ve lost 20lbs over this period (in a healthy way) bc I’ve convinced myself it’s how I look etc. 

But that doesn’t make sense. We FaceTimed 2x. She has my IG. Knows what I look like. She literally talked about continuing our thing. I’m just kinda devastated, this girl is one that comes around not very often. 

So, to those of you suffering from anxiety or depression, is it possible (based on her response and the ‘ghosting’)

a) She feels unworthy of me, not cool enough, like she’s too worthless and depressed, etc (she’s made comments on how ugly she thinks she is 😔)

b) She likes me a lot and fears getting too attached.... relative to abandonment and surprising her emotions? 

c) After getting intimate, she feels ashamed and embarrassed.... like weirded out b/c we just met.... and is too anxious to text back in that sense 

d) is having trouble talking to me now that I’m no longer an online profile/texter, and there’s an actual human being behind ‘me’? 

e) Is isolating hard, pushing away her emotions and feelings w/ me, and is realizing that while she wants sex / fun, a relationship is scary (despite initiating and suggesting it)?



Any insight is DEEPLY appreciated. This is killing me tbh, has been the entire time. I do not want to ‘move on’ if I still have a chance. I don’t see her mental illness as reason to say ‘fuck it, too much baggage’ — anxiety and depression do not make me value her any differently. Willing to make sacrifices. I’m a recovered drug addict - I can relate.

That said, I’ve been on 50mg Pristiq or Desvenlafaxine ER for about 6 weeks now and so much has happened I just need to rant. I had been on Lexapro 10 and 20 mg for about 2 years in the past and had far too severe side effects that started to ruin my life. Sure, I felt content but it wasn’t when I was doing something rewarding or something that I enjoyed, it was nonstop. I started to sleep through all my classes and lost interest in everything I loved. When I finally got the courage to tell my doctor he decided to double my dosage and my life went further downhill until I finally quit Lexapro all together. 

Now after a few hospitalizations, problems in my personal life, and a year off my meds I’ve started on Pristiq. At first I had some side effects like no appetite and some insomnia but these were relatively normal for me  as I also take 25mg Adderall XR and Hydroxyzine a few times a day as needed. These initial effects started to fade and now I’m starting to feel the effects of Pristiq. Well actually I’m starting to ‘not feel’ them if you know what I mean. 

I don’t feel anything anymore. I can zone out staring at nothing while my vision goes blurry and not a thought goes through my head. Especially when I’m mid-conversation. I just drift off to another planet. I truly don’t feel anxious and depressed anymore but it’s because I don’t feel anything anymore. I’m starting to feel like an emotionless zombie. Honestly I kinda like it because I’d rather feel nothing than constant pain and worry. 

Lately I’ve been having the most vivid, realistic dreams almost nightly when in the past I would have none at all. But it’s rather calming. My mind space is honestly the best it’s been in years and I’m starting to fuck with this constant feeling of the void

However, I don’t know if it’s the Pristiq or the Hydroxyzine but I would strongly recommend not drinking. I finally decided to after over a month because I’m in college so you know how it is.

I’ve worked there for  two years off and on. I’ve seen about 6 full staffs come and go during my time there. I make 9 an hour and it’s in walking distance so it’s convenient. However my boss is a bully she has actively called my mom bitter and stuff to my face. She makes little side comments and I’m not really good at standing up for my self so I just don’t say anything and ignore her. I’ve had several job offers in the past few months but have turned them down because of the convenience of my current job. I haven’t left because of convenience and despite hating her I’m comfortable there. I know the ropes and the rules and I’m not the new girl.

1019,Moxenn,1613884628,"I have a lot of mental health issues, and while I’m getting them taken care of I’m really worried about this situation in particular.

I fell in love with my 20M best friend. I am 19F. Me and him had a semi-relationship for awhile, and he lead me on and then broke my heart in the worst possible way. I realize now that he was fairly abusive towards me, but unfortunately I am unable to be fully away from him for the next 2-4 years, as we go to the same college, have the same friend groups, and are living together in a few months.

I was incredibly suicidal the week before Valentine’s Day. After recently moving state, and some severe miscommunication between friends that was caused by my ex-best friend, I was completely isolated and suffering without anyone to rely on besides him. I made the poor decision of getting drunk with some friends at their house, and he was my designated driver for bringing me home. I was close to blacked out, and wasn’t okay. I had a complete mental breakdown in his car, in his arms, and during said mental breakdown he told me that we would never be in a relationship together. I had been planning to end my life that night, but he had pushed me over the edge to the point I didn’t have enough energy or will to and that is the only reason I am here today.

I went home that night after telling him to take care of himself, and he panicked. He called me on my phone and was asking me not to kill myself and was just overall very scared. I hung up on him once I started crying because I didn’t want to be emotionally open with him after he had hurt me like that. We talked over text for a few minutes before he stopped responding to me and I think went to bed, essentially abandoning me when I needed help the most. I self harmed that night worse than I ever have before.

I had gotten him a Valentine’s Day gift because I wanted to do something nice for him, so he came to get that the next day. He told me that me telling him to take care of himself triggered him a lot, and essentially guilt tripped me for my mental breakdown. I told him we couldn’t be friends for awhile because while I was near him when I had feelings I would only want more, and he said “as long as I get you back eventually, I’ll be okay”. We hugged goodbye that day and I tried not to break down, and we joked about an inside joke we have and used it as a “see-you-later-but-not-goodbye” thing.

He told no one of what happened. Not the night where I wanted to die, not my plans for suicide, not that my life had been in danger that night, not that he had hurt me. He just stopped talking to me and about me.

I found out he had intentionally told my friends not to talk to me when I needed support the most because I was “going through too much”.

He also had made me believe this group didn’t like me anymore and were intentionally excluding me from hanging out, which really hurt me and made me hesitant to reach out to them.

I had texted our group we were going to move in with the next day saying I needed to break our lease, and to ask them for help finding someone to take my part of the lease.

He apparently said this was an “empty threat”.

When I finally mustered the courage to talk to my friends again, I did not find the angry group I was expecting. I found a group that was scared for me, and wanted to help me in any way they could. People who truly loved me and missed me, and who were confused because of what he told them. We all cried together that night, and was was the night we realized my best friend had abandoned me and left me to die. He left me that night without telling anyone what I was going through, when I should have gone to the hospital. They were all horrified because none of them would have known to check on me, and by that point it would have been too late. No one would have found me until my dorm room started to smell, and he said nothing. By that point, I could have been dead for 4 days and he still had not told them.

He took my friends away and threw me away.

We have not talked since other than me to tell him over text that I feel he essentially left me to die on my darkest night, and that I was very upset with him. I told him he had no right to say he cared about me and loved me like he did. I yelled at him for isolating me, for abandoning me, and saying things behind my back. He apologized sincerely, but I am unable to accept his apology. Every response back from him was an apology, and he told me it would never happen again. This was after he was done making excuses for what he did. He told me he did everything he did to protect me. I told him it was bullshit. 

I told him I refuse to be his friend until he’s in therapy consistently (he has mental issues he’s not taking care of and they’ve lead to behavior like this, just not to this extent). I told him I don’t forgive him, but I don’t hate him and I still care about him. I told him that we should stay away from each other for awhile, but that if he saw me around later and wanted to try to talk things out more he could. I told him that the door to have a friendship with me is closed, but not locked and if he wants to be my friend, things need to change.

He said: “That’s completely fair and I will be getting therapy to work on everything”.

We have not spoken since then.

As I said, we all have the same friend group, and we would often hang out at the Guys’ place (the guys of my friend group). They are all livid with him for what he did to me, and he’s been excluded from group stuff  for separate reasons, but it’s become more permanent until I feel more comfortable being around him. They all try their best to make me feel comfortable and safe. However, I can’t even stand to be in the same apartment as him. If he’s in the other room, I am constantly afraid. He now scares the hell out of me when he used to feel like home to me. When I was in their front room, he had locked himself in his room and I was fending off a panic attack and had to leave just because I knew he was there. I was at their place because we went home early from a hangout when a girl in my group drank too much and got sick, but I didn’t have the keys to the Girls’ apartment (my friend group lives in the same complex, but on different floors. Girls with girls, guys with guys). One of the guys, who I appreciate so much for doing this, brought me back to the hangout to get the keys so I wouldn’t have to stay in the same place as him. The idea of seeing him makes me anxious enough I dry heave, and I’ve had difficulties eating from the stress and anxiety. I had had problems with eating prior to this situation, to where I lost 7 pounds, but not like this. It’s gotten so bad that when I try to take my medication in the morning, I feel like I’m going to puke just swallowing them. I had only been able to eat 2 meals over the span of 6 days, and felt ill. 

I can’t completely get rid of him no matter how scared of him I am, and as I said before, I’m going to be living with him in a few months. I can’t afford to break my lease, and we have no idea who we would find to take my place in the lease.

I’m so scared of him, and I don’t want to be around him at all. I miss him, but I don’t want him in my life without change. I feel like this might just be who he is, a guy who doesn’t care about me, my health, my life, my safety. I feel all he will do his hurt me again. I feel like I am worth less than nothing to him. Worst of all, I have to live with him.

I was on the PC with headphones, so I wasn't aware. Our neighbors saw him through the cameras (we share the cameras with them), and they went on and talked with him. My mother, who's on her brother's beach house a few cities away, called us desperately because my father wasn't answering the phone (heavy sleeper), and she called him in a panicking tone, telling me to call my father ASAP. 

That already made my heart fucking race. Then, my father grabbed an Airsoft gun, took out the little orange pin at the tip, and went to the street (our house is a wall-closed lot) and confronted him. Dude claimed he was simply looking for a house with a similar number and just got it confused, but neither of us bought it.

1022,Lanky_Fella,1613883832,"I have been using medication and meditation as treatment for GAD and depression for the past year and it has been a relative success. Definitely not perfect but I’ve been able to find some peace.

Relationships and dating however have always been a huge trigger for me. I nearly always start talking to someone for a little bit, plan a first date and then bail because I get overwhelmed and my anxiety won’t go down until I just cancel everything and get back to normality. This has been a trend almost 10 times now in the past 2 years and is a terrible feeling to be failing at something I want so many times.

I recently slightly increased my medication dosage and for the most part it was going great. It led me to apply for a job for the first time in a year (I’m a uni student) and go on a date for the first time in 2 years. A girl and I who I was semi friends with had been talking for a month or so and were vibing pretty well. We admitted we both liked each other but I didn’t want a relationship because they overwhelm me and she didn’t want something just casual. I tried to find a middle ground but it was difficult. 

So one day I just said fuck it and asked her on a date because my meds were helping me feel like I could actually go through with it. So we went on 2 incredible dates and were feeling good together. When I was with her it was great, but when I wasn’t I was overthinking every hypothetical and it led me to unable to focus or enjoy anything else all week. A day after our 2nd date I told her this and said we might have to stop because it was unhealthy for me, but that I really liked her and wanted to keep trying to find something that works. She said she thought going back to just friends would be best if I felt like this. 

She had her birthday weekend the day I said this so a group of us were all staying together for a weekend. So I was stuck with her all weekend. We tried to work it out and I tried everything and I got completely overwhelmed seeing her the whole time. I tried to make everything right again and she eventually said okay this is definitely done, it’s just unhealthy for both of us and you’re feeling more intensely about it than I am. 

Now I’ve gone home and I’m left knowing that a relationship that I would have really enjoyed and been happy in failed because of my feelings. I was incapable of coping with something I wanted and therefore I can’t have it. How am I not supposed to feel like a failure?

The obvious suggestion that most people make here is therapy. But I hate therapy and it always makes me feel worse by going over every thought obsessively rather than actually helping to calm me down. I’ve tried it 3 times and even though I picked up some benefits I really don’t want to do it again.

If I don’t do therapy again to treat my inability to have a relationship, what do I do?

For the past few months, I’ve been getting horrible physical sensations that are ruining my life.

I was diagnosed with GAD, depression and panic disorder last year. Recently I’ve been feeling really “off” and hopeless. I haven’t been doing good since September as I witnessed my mother having a seizure. Since around that time, I’ve been having what I now know as derealization/depersonalization. 

On top of that I’ve had weird cold sensations in my head along with fast heart rate, insomnia, headaches at the front of my head, tremors and dizziness. These usually coincide with a trigger (Stomach aches, headache or learning about a possible illness) I used to feel panic and fear but now i just feel impending doom.

I got a lot of checkups 2 years ago and they all came back fine. My blood pressure was normal, my urine, blood and stool tests all came back as normal. I also had a endoscopy which found a ulcer in my stomach but that’s about it. These were 2 years ago however.

Tonight I had a tremor in my hand while I was researching cystic fibrosis. My heart started to beat fast then got flickering in my vision and a quick head pain followed by a weird tingly sensation behind my nose and in my head.

My mom is a hypochondriac and says she thinks I’m fine. I’m still able to somewhat function but I don’t feel right in my head at all. Can someone reasonably explain to me that all this is irrational. I can’t listen to myself.

I feel like I’ve never woken up normal for a year and all my brain can tell me is brain tumor. I feel like when I get “anxious” I just get brain fog and horrible physical sensation and a gut feeling that it’s a brain tumor.

I really only needed a psychiatrist to continue filling my 60mg of Cymbalta. However, as I began to meet with him, he kept prescribing more and more meds. I was honest with him about how i was feeling, and obviously, especially with the pandemic, I still had anxiety and depression. But the one med I was on was working well enough, I thought. 

He ended up prescribing me buspirone for anxiety, then after a genetic test switched my cymbalta to pristiq. He recently also added wellbutrin and now concerta. I trust him and I know he is trying to help me, but every time I express that i’m uncomfortable being on so many drugs he tells me that I shouldnt be and that its what i need to feel better.

anyway, i ended up moving out of my parents house and now live in another state with another insurance plan. my insurance isnt accepted by his practice, so im paying out of pocket. it seems reasonable that i find a new provider for that reason alone, but also because i really want to get another opinion and see if i can pare down this drug cocktail. however, the thought of telling him i will be finding a new provider makes me so anxious. i feel like i owe it to him to remain his patient or something, like i would upset or disappoint him if i found a new doctor. is this normal??? i dont know what to do, i know it seems ridiculous.

1031,EatDonutsNotChips,1613880894,"Hi Reddit, bear with me. Long post here.

I tend to be normal for most of my life, but there are certain times where I hit lows and my mental health is not in the best state. These low states of mental health are not caused by some external factors, but is mostly due to the reason of overthinking, which I've tried to control in the past few months.

I constantly think about my future, the goals and ambitions I set for the rest of my life. I don't get feared when I detour from the track I set to achieve my goals, I try to keep those fears aside and finish my work, but I do have a small kind of fear at the back of my head.

My parents have spent a LOT of money (which I think is a debt) on my higher education, and I want to repay them with my job's salary (they've never asked me to repay for them). Since I'm still in Uni, I strive to be at the top to increase my chances to get a better job.

The fear of not getting a good job and the fear of me not able to repay them has put me in a loop. I had a talk with my parents, and they believe that I should on my mental health first and then care for them, but I think I would feel ashamed for not repaying them.

Time passed by, and I continued to work, but there were some instances when this ""repaying fear"" came to my mind. I tried to find an escape route by trying to chill, but the fear was following me like hell.

I felt suicidal and tried to suffocate myself at midnight, but stopped midway and sobbed uncontrollablly. I thought about the responsibilities I have. It felt like an endless loop, felt stuck at pondered over my miserable life. Life has not been beautiful from now on.

I do have friends and I'm not lonely, but there isn't someone who would genuinely think about me, or would check on me. This made me sad and feel more lonely than ever.

I have had ocd and anxiety for the past 7 years and recently the paranoia about my body and mind has become the forefront of my anxiety. The cause of this was an allergic reaction I had earlier that was pretty serious (I broke out into hives). At the time of my allergy I didn't know what I was allergic to. Since having that allergic reaction I've been super paranoid about my throat closing and going into a shock and dying. It has gotten to a point where every single time I eat something I start having this sensation in my throat which prompts me to continuously swallow. It feels like there is a lump in my throat. I spend hours upon hours just being anxious about my throat and the sensation and I keep swallowing. Over time my neck becomes really tight and sore. My breathing throughout all of this is fine and is only shallow when I am overly anxious. 

I went to the immunologist today and turns out I am not allergic to anything besides cats, tree pollen, and dust mites. She even stated that I am not fatally allergic to anything. I came home today and ate something and started feeling those same sensations. It started with a sensation in my throat, but developed into me swallowing over and over again so I could prove to myself that my throat wasn't closing. Eventually my neck became very tight and sore. I don't know what to do to fix this issue. I was wondering if anyone dealt with this or has any type of advice about this.

Hello,

During Fall 2015 through Fall 2016. I attended a university. But due to struggling academically and health issues, I chose to leave and attend the community colleges near where I live. After doing better academically and health-wise, I decided to transfer to a university closer to where I live. I applied with the credits I received from the community college, got in, and received my degree in August 2020. On February 17th, I was working on an application for a program at the university that I graduated from and saw this notice. "" To continue, you must certify that all the information supplied above is correct and complete, and understand that any misrepresentation or falsification, including failure to report any college or university attendance, is sufficient cause for cancellation of enrollment and/or any credits earned and could result in other disciplinary action. "" This made me concern that I may have forgotten to put a university on another university admission application a few years ago as I can't check that application from a few years ago. The university has never contacted me about it but I am worried that it might result in my degree being revoked. Is there anything I can do? The program that I am interested in is only at two schools: the one that I got my bachelor's at and a private university. I am wondering if I apply for the Forensic Science program, will the admission office even look at my previous application or will they just focus on the application for the Forensic Science program if I put the university that I forgot about on it? I really need answers and I have been really stressing about this and have been having a hard time sleeping since February 18th.",Anxiety,"Forgot to put a university on another university admission application a few years ago.

This is going to be a long post. I am crying rn and i feel miserable. 

I am an older brother to three siblings two of which have mental ilness. They won't be able to provide for themselves

7 years ago, my mom got stroke. I was born very smart and gifted. I thought i will be going to help my dad to provide for my family. 
I studied hard in high school, and i git a scholarship to study abroad in STEM. I came to the US, and i hot multiple degrees.

Three years ago, i smoked marijuana and i got an exteremely bad trip. However, the day after, i did not get any affects. Then, a year after that i smoked again and i got the same trip, but this one's effect lasted with me. For the first week i was shaking. The first few months i could not sleep at night. I have had extreme bad anxiety. I am sared to get the bad trip which is extremely scary. I feel i am on the verge to get  in this bad trip. I feel i am schezefronic and i don't to be one.

1048,CaptainMaxCrunch,1613875562,"I'm a 22 year old guy. Ever since I was little, I've had severe anxiety, especially social. Every day before I went to elementary school I would have a panic attack because I was terrified of some emergency happening or making myself look stupid. It was horrible, but somehow anxiety didn't start to affect me that much until I made it to high school. My biggest frustration is how it's affected me socially.

My social anxiety kicked in really bad when I moved states to a new school. No one wants to be friends with someone who can't look them in the eyes or have a conversation without getting all sweaty.  I tried so hard to make myself seem cool and put myself out there. I worked out, dressed well, styled myself, the whole 9, but people could still see through it. I had a friend tell me ""You seem like you should be really cool, but you're actually a fucking loser."" That still keeps me up at night.

The worst part of all of it is my dating life. I didn't have my first girlfriend until I was 21, and I didn't even really like her, I was just desperate. I spent my whole high school career thinking I was disgusting and unlovable. It hurt to see everyone in relationships and having all their firsts when I hadn't even held hands with someone. I still cringe when I think back to the times I'd go to parties with the few friends I had and we would all play never have I ever. Of course all the questions were ""Never have I ever given a blowjob"", or ""never have I ever had a threesome"", etc., And I had to lie and pretend I knew what that was like to not seem like the weirdo.

Looking back now, I had so many opportunities that I was too paralyzed to act on, so I convinced myself they weren't there. I had my crush tell me she liked me and I got all sweaty and couldn't look her in the eye. A girl I was absolutely in love with told me she wanted me in her bed and I told her she was creepy because I didn't know how to react. Girls I absolutely loved in every way that gave me so many signs and even made the first move, and I ran away from almost every opportunity. The few times I did suck it up and go on a date, I was sweaty, blushing, and awkward the whole time so the girls lost interest out and stopped talking to me. The missed chances just cut like a knife when I think about what could have been.

Even now my anxiety haunts me. Every time I start to realize things are going well for me, it triggers this fight or flight response where I try to unintentionally sabotage myself. I'm studying animation at school, and we have a lot of projects that get shown in class. I know I'm a good, capable artist, but as soon as there is pressure to preform I just lose every shred of skill Ive worked for. I have instances like that nearly daily.

Sorry for the word vomit, I'm not really sure where I was going with this. I just felt like it would help to get it all out. I'm just so upset that I've made my life so much more miserable than it needs to be just because my brain decided to pump anxious hormones at the wrong times.

So I’ve struggled with anxiety for the longest time. It’s become pretty debilitating esp as I’ve gotten older so I decided to reach out for help. I’ve tried clonidine... didn’t help. Then I tried hydroxyzine and again... didn’t help. A few weeks ago my (24 F) father (50) tragically passed away and I’ve been a mess. Constant panic attacks. Can barely function. I’m supposed to be starting a new job but I can’t work like this. Honestly, I can’t continue to live like this.   My doctor is clearly not one of those who hand out benzos (which is understandable) and was hesitant about giving me .5 Lorazepam for 2 weeks but he did. Didn’t even ask, he just did it. Although he said he wouldn’t refill it. I tried it and it didn’t help AT ALL. Hell, I took 1 mg and it didn’t help. Anyway we had a follow up appt a few days ago and I told him I’m still struggling with the loss of my father on top of my recent anxiety attacks and that the .5 Lorazepam didn’t help me. Although he said he wasn’t going to make a refill on those he actually UPPED the dose to 1 mg, but only for a week. I’ve been taking 2 mg and it’s helped my tremendously. I feel like this and cognitive behavioral therapy is what’s going to change my life. Not only does the Lorazepam help my anxiety, it helps minimize my sweating! I’ve suffered from SEVERE primary hyperhydrosis (overactive nerve glands in the hands, armpits, feet, etc). I’m thinking the reason why it helps with my hyperhydrosis is because it calms my sympathetic nervous system.

1060,Waywardcone,1613872871,"Hi 

So I have an anxiety problem and I just want advice and things to calm me down/reassure me. Anyway let me explain: 

I deleted my discord last year after my antivirus said I had contracted the anarchygrabber virus. Honestly I believe it was a false positive because i put my account into deletion and cancelled it a couple times to make sure I wasn't losing anything.  In the end I did go through with it out of the safety for other people in the servers I was in from getting the virus. 

Anyway I'm in a server with some people I know in real life. I'm guessing another person in that server also ran into a discord problem and deleted his account too. He's a pretty 'edgy' person to say the least and his discord messages matched that.

I won't sit here and pretend I never sent edgy memes to the server as a 14/15 year old. However, I'm constantly worried that due to them both being labelled as 'deleted user' that there will be confusion on who actually sent those specific messages to the server. I'm really worried that their messages will be mistaken as mine and i'll be held responsible for anything they said. 

Please, I'm worried and I don't know why.",Anxiety,Fear involving discord,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lomfib/fear_involving_discord/,1613844071.0
1061,colinmcdd,1613872707,"  (I'm 17) So, in 3rd grade, I had a horrible stomach ache which made me miss a baseball game which I was excited to go but couldn't play because of my stomach having the worst feeling. So I went home and I tried to throw up in the sick, I tried to throw up for like 30 minutes and I just couldn't. I missed 3 days of school because I was just self-isolating myself in my room because I couldn't move. So that happened so fast forward to a year (4th grade) I had my first panic attack because I felt like throwing up. I never cared about throwing up ever but this time I just couldn't let myself throw up so I started to panic and called home and left school. So, in 4th grade had very few panic attacks but not as bad for me to do anything about it. So now in 5th grade, I'm now having panic attacks in class as in the middle of classes I would leave to go to the nurse or to the counselor's office to get calmed down. And by the way, during this time I've been getting bullied too, I've only had two friends at this point. So in my math class for 5th grade, I left so much that the teacher kicked me out of class because she thought I was just leaving just because, and I got very irritated because of that and cussed at the teacher then gotten suspended. So now I'm in 6th grade I've been officially diagnosed with anxiety. I couldn't eat anything, I couldn't hang out with my friends, I couldn't sleepover with my friends, I can't do anything without freaking the fuck out.  So in middle school, I'm still leaving classes because of my panic attacks to the point that the counselor's made a card just for me so I could leave class and go to the counselor's because I would feel too embarrassed to ask the teacher for me to leave. So at points, I just felt like just killing myself so I don't feel the pain and embarrassment that I've felt. But I didn't. So now like 10th grade barely getting anxiety and it's easier to control my anxiety and not having it day to day anxiety. (SO TO SUM IT ALL UP, IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE OR HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS GET FUCKING HELP LIKE REAL SHIT GET HELP DON'T WAIT, THERE are HOTLINES FOR YOU TO TALK TO PEOPLE PRIVATELY) I'll leave some phone numbers for people which are in need to express their illness to or just to talk to.

It’s been rough for me recently, and I’ve had a cry already today. I’ve been thinking about the rest of my life (big question) and what to do and my manager who works WAY too hard and never gets any time off turned out to be working tomorrow even though she shouldn’t 

To which I said that she should be taking time off, which she never does and if she always brings herself into work when people are sick then that’s more of a failing of the business than anything else. No one is on holiday, if one person is sick then it shouldn’t make a difference. She needs a break!

But that went down like a lead balloon, and now I’m worried that she’s going to be angry at me. Which she might be, but all I want is that she gets some bloody time off- so she can rest! It’s not like the rest of us can’t handle the work.

And it stresses me out massively. And it makes me not want any of the responsibility that I’ve got on me at work. I work as her second in command, and I just don’t want to do it any more.before you say that might be why she’s coming in, it’s not, I’m pretty good at my job and one of the best on the team. 

But I feel like I’m not doing a good job because she is always coming into work. I don’t like the people I work with, I don’t get paid enough, I don’t get overtime, and I don’t want to do it any more. I am never going to do the job she is going to do because I’m never making that commitment. She gets texts 24/7 7 days a week. Even if she takes time off! Plus when she comes in for emergencies. 

The business fucked itself because we have crap members on the team and they’re never told to step up.

And I know that it’s all just a weird way that my anxiety is coming out because of bigger problems. But I’m so stressed and unhappy and I can’t sleep!

Somewhere in the conversation, my dad told me to ""give [them both] a psychiatric evaluation"". What he meant was that he wanted me to tell them both which behaviours I thought they'd gotten from their parents.

1082,SnowBun9968,1613865457,"I'm not sure if this is OCD, but I (19F) have been dealing with intrusive thoughts for almost 6 months now. They are somewhat similar to POCD, but I get gruesome intrusive images of men abusing children (it is never me), and I also get intrusive thoughts like ""what if she is being abused"" and ""what if that father is a pedophile who is abusing his child?"". I think I have these thoughts because I absolutely detest and fear child sexual abuse, more than any other act in this world. The thoughts are distressing, but I have been able to use online resources and tips in order to decrease the amount of thoughts. 

Lately though, I have been worrying over the 'groinal response', which is debilitating. I could tell immediately that it was not arousal. And it usually doesn't happen at the moment of the intrusive thought, it happens while I am ruminating and when my anxiety is at its peak. I can tell that this truly doesn't mean anything because of the fact that it just happens when I am super anxious. I could be watching a tv show involving nothing sexual, and get a groinal response due to anxiety. Though, whether I am anxious about being aroused by the gore in the show, I dont know. 

I think one of my fears, that lines up with POCD, is that I would EVER be attracted to any form of sexual child abuse. Because I used to watch shota as a child and read inappropriate underage fanfiction, this fear has somewhat tangible evidence. Even though I was the same age as the characters, it still disturbs me. I know for a  FACT that I have no interest in children, and that I never have (I am attracted to men at least 5 years older then me). This groinal response has me questioning though ""why would I have this if I did not fear being aroused by children?"" . ""Even though this technically doesn't mean anything, does the groinal response indicate that I think I am a pedophile?""  It is confusing, but I guess my fear isn't that I am a pedophile (because I'm not). I actually fear the possibility of me fearing that I am a pedophile... sorry if that makes no sense.

**I kind of deviated from the main point, but I think the root of all my fear, is from fear of judgment. I constantly worry like ""oh god, I had another groinal response. How will I ever explain this to my future partner?"" I even go as far as to play out scenarios in my head, where I try to detail my problems to people. I just find it hard to stop thinking about others opinions. I feel like if I were to describe my issues like I did above, so many people would think I am a horrible person. I dont want to be a bad person. But going through all this (the intrusice thoughts, grounal response, etc.) I feel like the scum of the earth. Like, even if it was due to anxiety and nothing more, who would ever get a feeling down there when ruminating about child sexual abuse?? I want to be done with this, and hopefully I will get better with the help of my new therapist. But this constant fear of what other people think is ruining me. I want to have lasting relationships, and feel like I deserve them. I want to find love, and have good friends. But I feel like I will never deserve it, even after I eventually get through this. If anyone has any advice or success in this department, please let me know. I know deep down that I am not technically a bad person, because bad people do bad things without worrying about being bad. But it is hard to accept that these intrusive thoughts paired with the groinal response does not make me a disgustingly vile person. I think I would be able to explain the intrusive thoughts to my friends and partner. But the groinal response??? Who would ever accept me and my past...**

Sometimes I cant even watch a tv show because my brain will be like ""See that main character you like, and aspire to be? You could never be him/her. Everyone in that show would think you are disgusting and would hate you on the spot."" Or , ""See that villain? Who is literally burning an entire city down? You are far far worse then him.

the other night i zoned out while talking with my girlfriend and she snapped me out of it insisting i tell her what was on my mind. i know this is gonna seem ridiculous and extra but i genuinely was scared to tell her what my brain was telling me. she finally got me to say it and i told her my intrusive thoughts were taking over. she wanted to know what they were. i hesitated but i decided to be honest, and i basically told her that my brain was literally telling me to stab her eyes out.

I'm claustrophobic, and she knows I really don't like feeling confined etc. despite many harsh comments to my dad about 'refusing' to wear a mask (I don't go out, other than to the woods/open spaces; hence the moaning). I'd told her I was really anxious about having to be in the MRI machine, and wear a mask for so long.
Leading up to my MRI, she hadn't so much as mentioned it, even up to getting out of the car (she doesn't talk to me about my stuff).
When I got picked up, again, nothing - other than getting increasingly irritated and huffy at me being quiet. 

I'm quite quiet anyway, but when I'm anxious, I get really quiet. I have done all my life. But every time I have a health appointment that's super scary for me, she gets angry at me (sighing LOUDLY, saying 'wow, ok then' really irritated like I'm ignoring her when I answer minimally, or am listening to headphones; almost demanding my interaction even though she can see I just want to sit and be quiet, and then getting loudly annoyed at me for not 'being okay'. 

Today, I nearly had to press the emergency button because I was riding a panic attack the whole time. It was exhausting being that anxious and trying not to have one, that when I got out, I just needed to breathe and be quiet. Which she immediately took personally, visibly huffing, making comments and rolling her eyes. 
It took 15 minutes for her to even ask me about the MRI, when I honestly told her it was horrendous and I really struggled. She told me 'she didn't mind it when she had one'. Couple of minutes of sympathy and she was back to her usual. I should mention that, rather than take me home afterwards, they made me ride along with errands for half an hour after. When I asked to go home (I also really needed a wee!) I got anger and frustration at my selfishness.
Once we were home, exactly the same 'WOW, rude' when I was quiet (after still very visibly and verbally telling them I still wasn't okay). My dad just helpfully said 'well, it's over now'...
I left straight away for a walk and heard more comments behind me as I left.

This is an ongoing thing now. My mother NEVER genuinely asks about my life, my anxiety, my feelings, what's up etc., just immediately and *constantly* prefers to put down my quietness or anxiety to me 'being in a mood'. I've tried addressing it, steering clear of her, doing my own thing, but whatever I do, I'm followed by comments, loud sighs and eye rolls when I'm not 'perky'. 

When I told her about my GAD and on/off struggles with severe depression, she acted like it explained a lot and would change things going forward, but NOTHING'S changed. She never actually asks about anything, just tells other's I'm 'moody'. 

I'm just *followed* by her condemnations when I fail to meet silent expectations. It's only when I walk out of a room, not having said much, that the 'WOW, OKAAAAY's follow me. It's got to the point that I hate weeks where I have anxiety attacks, because I know what'll come.
I've overheard too many conversations of her moaning about me, never once taking my anxiety or struggles into the slightest amount of consideration.

1107,Hi_there_peeps,1613859564,"Altho I can write about things just fine, (hence why I sometimes write things on paper to people when I am unable to speak). I have this issue where if I attempt to talk to someone about how I feel, especially someone I'm not comfortable talking with, I freeze completely and just can't say a word. Idk what I'm so afraid of tbh, it just happens. It's also a problem when attempting to ask someone to talk. Like, I walk up to them but then I get so nervous that I end up withdrawing. Idk, it always sounds so darn easy in my head, but then, when the person I want to talk with approaches me, or I approach them, anxiety is like ""f\*ck this!"" and I freeze completely making me completely unable to say a word. This is really annoying bc people tend to either get frustrated over me not talking, or mistake it for meaning that I don't want to talk/want to be left alone.

Fortunately, as long as I have people around me that I am comfortable with (I do) and something to write on (I also do) it is fine. Oddly enough, once pple has read what I wrote and we begin talking about it, I am somehow able to say almost everything I wanted to say. It's as if this ""wall"" get's removed once they read the note. 

I have autism btw, so this is somewhat related to my autism as well. 

If anybody else has the same issue, or similar, just know that you're not alone! Just stay strong and know that there is no shame in writing rather than talking. Alot of people does that, belive me! From my own experience most people are equally happy that you talked to them about whatever is bothering you regardless of whether you spoke or wrote. 

I just wrote this bc I'm hoping this can motivate someone who might have the same issue as me to try and speak to someone, maybe write a note, or atleast make them feel better about themselves.

1108,tothecountry,1613859383,", so, I'm just going to run through my mental health history real quick -- I've been dealing with anxiety my whole life. I was diagnosed with selective mutism and general anxiety when i was around 7, than with generalised anxiety when i was fourteen. 
I am scared of so many things. In fact, i keep a list on my laptop of all of my fears (just over 60, yay!) - dying, my parents dying, cancer, heart attacks, driving, being alone... I could go on. Anxiety can be triggered by anything - the slightest bodily sensation, an item on the news, something someone tells me etc. Sometimes it is triggered by nothing at all, and I'm just scared to leave the house for no reason, or find my self curled up in bed, shaking, for no apparent reason. I've been dealing with anxiety and anxiety attacks for so long that I've developed a fear of fear itself - fear of having a panic attack, especially in public, and therefore avoiding any type of activity i fear would cause me fear (stupid f***ing anxiety) - going to new places, meeting new people, etc. When I'm having anxiety i feel dissociated, like I'm watching the world through a screen, everything moves slightly slowly. I worry someone may notice my hazy state and this causes me further anxiety. 
These days, because of covid, I've been especially concerned with my health, and suspect and chest pain or headache to be the virus. These past few days i've been crying myself to sleep feeling absolutely exhausted by my mind overworking itself. I've been looking for a therapist online, but just seeing their smiley faces, remembering that they're just human, causes me great despair.
 I've been two countless treatments ever since i was a child - CBT, art therapy, mindfulness, coaching..., and am currently under medical treatment (for over a decade now i believe). That type of environment always feels so unnatural and against my initial instinct - me, a socially anxious person with dissociative tendencies, sitting in a room with a total stranger, looking at me with expectation, waiting for me to open my mouth and tell them every intimate detail about my life. And what does come it is usually an incoherent sentence (much like this post) that doesn't cover the half of it. These experiences were more than anything, traumatizing, especially as a little girl, and have made me avoid therapy into my adult life. I've never found a therapist or form of therapy that i felt truly comfortable with, that could help me grow and get my emotions under control, yet not cross my boundries. And now that im 21, still suffering from anxiety, not all the time of course but a great portion of it, great enough to harm my quality of living and force me into tearfully writing a reddit post at 1am, i am just at complete despair, not knowing what to do.

Almost like being hungover, that spins type of feeling but I am months sober at this point. I cut out all recreational drugs and alcohol because they were huge triggers for me and it was necessary that do. I used to be a huge binge drinker for years. I feel it damaged parts of my brain or something.

I am a 23 year old male, and when I get like this I have to try to focus in things that really matter to me. My two main things that calm me down and give me something to focus on other than my inner demons are my wonderful girlfriend of 4 years, and my cat who is turning one in a few weeks.

Do you guys have any people/things/pets/hobbies that keep you grounded? I know for me when I start feeling like I am going to die or vanish from the world due to anxiety, my cat can almost sense it and will come curl up next to me and bump her head on mine in a super loving way. Same goes for my girlfriend, we both suffer panic attacks and anxiety so she knows when I am in the middle of an attack, and she will just scratch my back, rub my feet and get me some tea. 

The greatest thing to keep in mind is these feelings are all temporary. When I am going through it, I just repeat to myself in my head that every time I get like this it tortures me for a few days, I battle it, and then it seems to crawl back into the deep caverns of my mind for months at a time leaving me mostly alone.

The worst is at around 5pm when I am tired, dont want to work, I want to relax, but there is enough light outside that turning off the lights doesnt lead to a nice dark dim environment. But turning the lights on isnt as bright as day time still so it feels stressful having neither a bright sunlit space or a relaxing dark/dim space. And also I just dislike bright lightbulbs. 

I often get really antsy between 3 and 6 pm and I just find it hard to focus.

1116,NotASynthPromise,1613858247,"Hi all,

So I've been dating a friend I met in college last September since late December. We were pretty good friends for a little bit, and then she asked me out just after Thanksgiving. We're coming up on two months, but haven't taken things beyond leaning on each other on the couch during a movie. I tried initiating a first kiss about two weeks ago but she was worried about taking the next step, and we haven't gone any further since. I haven't been in a relationship before, and I have diagnosed anxiety, so 'surprise surprise' I've had a lot of anxiety around dating. Things like ""Does she actually like me, am I going too fast, am I going too slow, does it seem like I care"", etc. The whole first kiss incident didn't help that either.

This peaked about 2 or so weeks ago, and kept going for a while after that, but for the past few days I've felt a bit better. Still a little bit here and there but it's very manageable. I've been wanting to talk to her about my relationship anxiety for a few days now just to sort of get it off my chest. I feel like I'd enjoy dating more if I do that.

But, should I do it now? We've talked about our own general anxieties before, and both shared some more personal details. But this is directly related to our relationship, meaning it directly involves her (It's mostly what's gone on in my head, like yeah she's been a little awkward about some things which didn't help, but it's &gt;90% my overthinking). I don't want it to come off like I'm trying to make excuses for me doing things wrong, and definitely don't want to seem like I'm blaming her in any way.

So, what should I do? Should I tell her soon? Talk to her in person, or would texting be ok? Or maybe wait a bit so I don't drop this personal bomb on her so early?

I'm cautious about talking about it in person, since I wouldn't want to ruin the mood or make it seem like a ""pity me, give me attention"" type thing.

I really like her, and I'm enjoying dating other than the anxiety. So I don't want any of that to end just to be clear.

1121,Alessandra1998,1613857012,"So I (F23) have had death anxiety since I learned to talk. According to my mom, as soon as I was able to form full sentences, I constantly told her how worried I was about something happening to her or my dad. For example, when I was 2, ny mom went back to work and told me I’d be with my nanny during the day and she’d come back later. I cried every morning before she left so one day she asked what worried me so much, because I adored my nanny and trusted her so much. She says that (at just 2 years old) I told her “I’m not worried about me silly, I’m worried about you”. This obviously worried her because what 2 year old thinks she can take care of her parents. They took me to therapy when I was 11 because I literally could not go anywhere without at least one of them, for fear of something happening to them. I couldn’t go 3 hours in school without having a meltdown and calling my parents, just to make sure they were safe. My mom says that I never really worried about my own well being, just theirs. In my early teens I kind of got over this whole thing (therapy helped), but for the past 4 years, my death anxiety has been at it again. With Covid it got a hell of a lot worse, because the danger was actually imminent this time. And again, I don’t really worry about my self, just the people I love. I got diagnosed with GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder). Truth is I already know, since I’m a psychology major, I identified my own symptoms years ago but didn’t actually have the courage to talk to someone. Because of the pandemic I just couldn’t live with my self anymore and got helped. I’m currently on medication (venlafaxine) and actually doing much better, compared to the last few years. My GAD symptoms consist basically on what I already mentioned, constant feelings of guilt over all kinds of things, insomnia, etc. Everything has gotten better except for the death anxiety. The thing that tortures my most is how final death actually is. How we built lives next to our loved ones, how we are able to make connections so deep that even thinking about losing them is just too much. I hate how everything I have, everything I have and will build can be pulled out from under me like a rug or something. I always worry about allowing myself to be happy, because the happier I am, the more I have to lose. When I talk about this with some people, they just don’t get it. I get comments such as “that’s just life”, “death is a natural thing”, it’s like I ALREADY KNOW THAT. What I want is for it not to haunt me as much. I was raised catholic but i’m not a religious person. I envy SO damn much how other people blindly believe that there is a life after this one and when we die we’ll reunite with our loved ones, etc. I want so badly to believe that, I really do. I don’t care what kind of afterlife there is, if it is Valhalla or Heaven or even just reincarnation like the buddhists. I just need to believe there is something, that what I do here matters and that whatever happens I’ll get too see my loved ones after it. I’m sorry if all this sounds weak to whoever reads this, because it does kind of sound weak to my. Thing is i’ve always been someone to feel everything so intensly, I get easily overwhelmed. If anyone has any tips or words of advice for me, I’ll happily read them. Also, if any of you are people of faith who will gladly try to convince me of the existance of an afterlife (any kind really), i’ll be supper grateful.

1122,raisedglazed,1613856838,"I’ve been going through a bit of an anxiety spike lately and I’ve been noticing all these random thoughts/worries popping up.

Most recently I’ve noticed that I worry about causing pain to things that don’t even feel it. Like, I have quite a few houseplants and brought a new one home from the nursery yesterday. A leaf had somehow fallen off on the drive home and I can’t even bring myself to throw it away because it just feels so bad to toss away a living thing. Even though it’s a leaf that already fell off the plant 🤦🏻‍♀️

Another one of my vining plants started somehow growing into a crack in my wall and i tried to gently remove it but couldn’t, and ended up having to break off the tip of that vine. I literally apologized to the plant profusely (as if it was a human baby whose head I bonked accidentally, or my cat when I step on her tail). I felt so bad about breaking it! I was all worried about whether or not I caused it pain and just felt really sorry and sad.

I know it’s completely irrational, like they’re just plants, and I’m going to have to prune them at some point too.

Idk, I guess I’m just venting and asking if anyone has felt this way?

1123,xinglaopo,1613856712,"I recently (all too late) realized that I'd been burdening my parents with my mental health issues and insecurities way too much, for way too long. They're clearly tired and they've kinda given up on me ever getting better, and I fully get it. A decade of my neuroses would drive anyone insane, they've given so much of their time and even money to support me through all my difficulties and they're near retirement age. Not just that, but they've been pretty much my only confidants for years, and that's too heavy of a task for two people.

Usually I'd vent to someone (mostly my mom) to relieve my anxiety, I find that it makes me feel better to not be so bottled up and to air things out. I'd often ask my folks for advice and rely on them for emotional support, but I think I have to stop doing that since they've been suffering and it'd be selfish of me to ignore their well being. However I don't really have anyone else as a support system... So I guess I have to become my own support system, right?

Serious question: How does one become perfectly self-reliant with managing anxiety? Medications did nothing to help me and I'm seeing a therapist, but I'd rather not burden her too. I like her too much to do that, she's a good person. Kind of a naïve idealist in some ways, but I like that about her.

It's genuinely my goal to become self-reliant and to learn to make decisions without consulting my family about them, but... Where do I even begin? How do I do that? How do I unlearn venting as a survival mechanism and learn to be my own confidant, consultant and emotional support? How do I learn to see through the haze of an anxious spiral and talk myself out of it?

I realize the irony of consulting the internet, but I was thinking... just one last time. Then it's time to grow up. :(

Hello,

During Fall 2015 through Fall 2016. I attended a university. But due to struggling academically and health issues, I chose to leave and attend the community colleges near where I live. After doing better academically and health-wise, I decided to transfer to a university closer to where I live. I applied with the credits I received from the community college, got in, and received my degree in August 2020. On February 17th, I was working on an application for a program at the university that I graduated from and saw this notice. "" To continue, you must certify that all the information supplied above is correct and complete, and understand that any misrepresentation or falsification, including failure to report any college or university attendance, is sufficient cause for cancellation of enrollment and/or any credits earned and could result in other disciplinary action.

The university has never contacted me about it but I am worried that it might result in my degree being revoked. Is there anything I can do? The program that I am interested in is only at two schools: the one that I got my bachelor's at and a private university.

It’s very unlikely it is something serious and it’s all my brain playing tricks on me.

I’ve had a mri done because of my migraines and everything is fine, I’ve had ekg done 5 months ago, I had a chest x ray done when they thought I had a hiatal hernia but it was just GERD it was a barium swallow test but the doctors do a normal chest x ray first so that should have showed issues too. So from what I know thyroid levels fine, brain heart all healthy, vitamin b12 fine. 

I just still feel like something is wrong whenever I get super dizzy from my vestibular migraines or I start to get issues with my breathing I have mild asthma but suddenly my brain thinks I’m always having issues with it which I doubt since my lung function test was so good. It’s like I don’t search for problems or look at my body and see if something could be wrong with me it’s more like my brain just is hyper focused on my body sensations and it doesn’t filter anything out anymore. Like even decaf coffee makes me jittery I used to never notice that before. 

(To summarize it I just need all the advice I can get to get my brain to stop being so hyper aware of my body! And I’m seeing a therapist and using the methods she gives me but it’s still happening and I’m super discouraged.

1142,okhithere72,1613847981,"This might be triggering for some so I am saying that here.

I am 19M and I have been having bad anxiety over my health both physical and mental over the past 2 months. It has developed into having fears of dying suddenly, having some horrible physical illness or disease like cancer, developing schizophrenia or psychosis, and the fear of potentially getting any of them. It truly is one of the most devastating things to ever happen in my life and I am really afraid of what may happen to me. I truly regret my decision for what I did..

Everything was normal in my life.. In December, school was ending and I couldn’t get the feeling of discomfort out of me after I got my grades. So I decided I wanted to get high. My dad uses medical marijuana and allowed me to use it a few times with him. I only used it 4 times till the time in December and all were very pleasant and fun experiences. However this time was very different and very bad. 

The product I took was an extra strength THC tincture that had hardly any CBD in it. I thought that the more THC, the better the high. So I put an entire dropper (1ml) under my tongue and swallow. Then, I decide to go online to see how much THC is good to take as an edible/tincture form. With my findings, I decide to consume another half a dropper. I consumed about 80-100mg of THC, thinking that I would get a really great high. I didn’t. It was much worse. And I regret it very much..

The high was so bad that I ended up going into my dads room and telling him everything I did. He comforted me through the hell I was witnessing in my head. It was the most panic inducing and most traumatizing event to ever happen to me in my life. After the bad high/trip, I was trying to fall asleep but I was panicking really bad. I managed to sleep, but I woke up the following day not being able to breathe. It made me fear going to sleep for a week. 

Everyday since has been filled with existential dread and anxiety. I have been fearing of having cancer, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses like bipolar, death, and the anxiety itself thinking it may never go away at times. My brain is so attached to these fears and it hooks them with valid reasons onto why I *might* have them. It’s so terrifying. The intrusive thoughts are really bad at times, especially at night and when I wake up. I even had times where I though I was hearing voices and that freaked me out. I had some mental breakdowns because of these things and at some point contemplated suicide. I did end up getting help.

My body has never been the same since and I really do hate for what I did. I have discussed a lot of what has been happening to me with my family and friends and they keep reassuring me that I am fine and will be fine. It’s hard for me to believe them when I can say I am experiencing these things. I don’t feel much hunger, I have a hot stomach, bad intrusive thoughts, all these fears, constant anxiety, visual snow, etc etc etc.... It really is hard and I just want to be normal again.

I take Zoloft 25mg and go to Christian counseling cause of my dad. And even now I question my faith and the decision to use drugs as that’s how I got into this mess. My dad says it’s all in my head and that you’ll be fine. Even many times, he’s been upset with me with the choices I have been making. I dropped my math classes this semester because it has been so hard to pick up my textbooks and work. I even contemplated taking a semester break with my counselor and my dad says I’m quitting school and that I’m being a quitter if I take many months off of school. He wants me to toughen up and “be a man, not a girl.” (He’s a conservative Christian). As much as he loves me a lot, he’s been really hard on me. I’ve been keeping my mouth shut when I’m around him only talking about “the good things” and not my actual feelings. Life has been really hard and really the only thing that has kept me sane is my brother, my friends, and lurking on Reddit as much as it gives me the reassurance that someone out there is suffering like me.

God help me. I really do regret what I did and I am terrified of so many things cause of it and my lifestyle. I haven’t been this open to my counselor and I am thinking about it. I really need a hug from someone who’s in the same boat or has been.

1145,ParadoxOnLegs,1613846575,"Hi.

Don't know if this is the place for this, but I need to vent a bit and sorry for my English, it's not my native language, and also sorry for the very long post. For a bit of backgroud, I've got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (and severe depression, and ""being just next to the autism spectrum but not quite on it"" as the psychiatrist said) two years ago, it's something I've lived with my entire life, but it got worse, two years ago, and I've been trying to get to ""normal life"" since then.

Today was a day of progress, at least it was supposed to be. Today, the plan was : go shopping, buy some new salad that I've never eaten (I've got a lot of food-related issues, so that in itself would have been champagne-opening worthy a year ago), then go home, do a bit of 3D sculpting (I'm trying to learn this, I want this to become my job long term), clean up the house a bit (again, would have never done that a year ago), end up the day with the food experiment. For someone who, at some point, couldn't find the energy to do anything but stay on his bed all day long, this shouldn't have been a ""waow I've done a stupid amount of stuff today, and some very hard stuff as well !"". Because of the covid restriction, I started with the shopping part.

It was a big source of anxiety, just the idea of buying something new I'll eat later was enough to give me the first symptoms of nausea, I took my ""if necessary"" treatment before, and even then, it wasn't easy. Inside, masks are mandatory, but I can't wear one normally, with my hypersensitivity it just makes me throw up immediately (anxiety really doesn't help that, quite the opposite in fact), so I wear it by not putting it over the left ear. I've talked about this with my doctor, who told me it's good enough. I've talked about this with my psychiatrist, he told me that if there were any issue, I have an official recognition as handicapped because of anxiety and depression so I just can explain that yes, I'm handicapped, that's the best I can do and no, the rule about wearing a mask normally don't apply to handicapped people who literally can't follow it. It never was a problem, except twice, where just saying ""I can't because handicap"" was enough for people to go ""oh, I'm sorry, just go ahead, if that's the best you can do it's good enough, no problem"". Outside of those two occasions, people either ignore it or just look at me weirdly, that I'm starting to be used to it now.

After a long walk in the shop, trying to find what I came for (and failing to find it, but going for another kind of salad I wanted to try), it came time to pay for it. What a relief to be done, go walk a bit, go home, be cool, all of that right ? This is supposed to be the easy part, it's socialization, something stressful, but it's ""codified"" so no issue.

When the cashier saw me, she asked me to put my mask ""the normal way"", asking me if it was a new trend to wear it weirdly like I do. I told her, I can't, if you want me to do so, sure, then I'll throw up in two minutes. To which she replied : ""we all got excuses, I've been wearing mine for nine hours now and I'm not saying anything"". I tried to explain, ""I'm handicapped, you're not"", but she didn't listen, worse, now everyone was looking at me, all those judging eyes... didn't really help with how anxiety-inducing the situation already was. After that, she did her job, while giving me mean looks, I took my things, I paid, I left, saying a polite goodbye that wasn't answered.

I left there shaking and nearly crying, I tried to go walk a bit to think about something else but I couldn't, I just went back home, cried a lot, and have yet to do anything productive since. I'm gonna try to do a bit of sculpting I think, but the food experiment, which I were super proud of a few hours ago, will have to wait until another day, I don't have the mental energy to do anything anymore.

I don't understand what I'm supposed to do. I'm curing my illness, or trying to ""live with it"", that's what I've been doing for all my life and even more in the last two years, I take medication, I have therapy, I try to do stuff, I really do, people around me are impressed by all the effort I do and by all the progress I've managed to do in these last two years. But it doesn't seem to be enough, if I can't wear my mask the way I do then I can't go into any shop until covid is over, nor could I go see a doctor or my therapist. How is it not obvious to them when I say ""I'm handicapped, my brain is not wired like yours, if I do what you consider normal I'll throw up"", or ""I'm ILL, you're not""... how is it just an ""excuse"" like ""everybody has"" ?

Today was supposed to be progress day, instead today is ""let's cry on our bed until it's over"" day and I don't really know what to do about this other than posting it somewhere to try to take the emotions out of my head, so... here I am. I just... I hate this life, I really do...",Anxiety,Anxiety and people not understanding it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lodm6w/anxiety_and_people_not_understanding_it/,1613817775.0

When I came out as gay, my entire dad's side of the family otrisized me (except my dad's mom, the grandmother that just past). My dad kicked me out of his house, and I never heard from my aunt/uncle and cousins agian. They used to come down to FL (they live in Tx) every year for 4th of July. After I came out, they would still come to FL but they stopped telling me that they were in town. I'm 21 and haven't seen them since I was 13. My grandmother's funeral is Monday, and I'm torn on whether I should go or not. On one hand, she's my grandmother and I want to be there. On the other hand, I know that seeing them will be extremely hard. They are extremely homophobic and I've seen them look down on gay couples in public and say things about how ""disgusting"" it is. I also used to be in good shape, but when I was younger and went through puberty I put on some weight and they all teased me about it alot (tease it to put lightly, I was bullied). I lost the weight when I turned 16 and kept it off for nearly 5 years. But the past year, especially with covid, I've gained some weight back and I know if I see them it's going to be one of the first things they say. So I'm not sure what to do. Going to her funeral is tough as it is (she was the only one on my dad's side of the family that accepted me for being gay and I loved her very much).

I’ve always had an issue with anxiety but didn’t really understand that this was something that other people didn’t feel all the time (something this subreddit has really helped me appreciate).

A few weeks ago, I had a dream that I was arrested for being drunk or something and having to stay the night in a police cell.  When woke up in the morning with the most intense feeling of anxiety. I’ve never been arrested in my whole life but I had this strange spiral into anxious thought in which I started doubting the fact, i.e, if I were drunk like I was in my dream could I have forgotten it? What if I apply for a job and it comes up on a background check? I feel really silly even writing this down.

If you haven’t had an experience like this, think of it like laying in bed when an embarrassing memory comes to you except for the fact that it didn’t happen. 

I realised, I do this quite often, but ultimately land on the side of reality after torturing myself for weeks.

I’ve been getting this more often lately and I think it’s something to do with the lack of real social interaction during lockdown. 

It’s a freeing realisation that it comes from anxiety which means I can overcome it but I can’t work out if this is normal or not.

I normally consider myself a very self-aware person, but I couldn't for the life of me think clearly about one particular anxiety I had for some reason.  And then I figured - why not try writing my thoughts down?  It's helped before somewhat, at least just to clarify my thoughts.

A lot of the time I don't bother, but this time I did.  I ended up writing for about 2 hours (with a break in between) of just train of thought stuff with about 26 paragraphs worth of text as a result (I just wrote on the notes app on my phone).  And an unintended result came out of it - I managed to clarify why I wanted to do what I'm going to do in the first place.  And by clarifying my motivation, it means that I no longer have to hold onto this residual guilt that I would have had if I'd just broke the news straight up.

1163,palikona,1613840443,"Hi,

I’ve been on K-pin for 8 weeks to help my body adjust to 10mg of Lexapro.  I had a really hard time with Lex since I’m very sensitive to meds and had to slowly increase from 5 to 7.5 to 10.  But that part has now settled which is great - 10 seems to be helping.  My psychiatrist had me on 1.5mg of Klonopin each day (1mg during the day and .5mg during the evening).  This was the dose I needed in order to function when I was on the lower Lex doses.  Now, she is having me slowly taper off .25mg at a time.  I’m on day two of this and feel the increase of anxiety (not too bad but I’m edgy) and a headache.  Does anyone have an idea of how many days these withdrawal side effects last after cutting one step down.  My psychiatrist expected me to not really have any side effects but I’m definitely feeling some.  But it would help to have a sense of these will last a day or two or longer.

I have anxiety about most things but one thing that can really just turn my day upside down is hearing about death or missing people/pets? For example just 10 minutes ago my mum told my that a puppy went missing in the river we live by and there was police and rescue down there, just hearing about animals coming to harm and especially going missing really triggers me and I often can’t get the thought of it out of my head. It becomes an intrusive thought that won’t go away and fills me with dread. I understand that everyone feels upset by news like this but it becomes an obsession of mine to keep checking whether there is news that they’ve been found which means I feel like this for days.

&amp;#x200B;

So I posted here my first post about my fear to see if anyone struggled like me and a lot of people were very helpful and very kind about everything. Now this is were things get really bad. Tuesday morning had no power due to the winter storm and we live in Texas. Now we live in a city where our plants get treated daily, our water doesn't come from wells or anything rather normal sources and heavily treated. My parents are both Muslim people and usually perform a ritual to wash themselves before prayer and one of the the parts of washing yourselves is that you kind of put water at the entrance of your nose and sniff it out hard and they have been doing this there whole lives. Now Tuesday we didn't get a notification about the boil water notice we got it Wednesday morning. Tuesday my parents or specifically my father said he didn't put water in his nose at all because the pressure was too low and the water was freezing in the pipes and barely any water was coming through. Now Wednesday when we found out we had the boil water notice in the morning of course we boiled water due to natural gas we were blessed and managed to understand and not use the water to shower or clean ourselves with it unless we understood not to use it to drink with or put up our nose. So we boiled everything and had normal drinking water and they performed there ritual without putting water in there nose. They showered all expect for me but made sure to be very careful not to have water around there face and they were blowing there nose to double check when I would ask them too. Friday which just passed a few hours ago I found out my mom has been putting water in her nose and blowing it out even though we were still on boil water notice. Now Thursday and Friday the water came back fully and it would become really hot and we had normal pressure, but we still had to be very careful since the notice was still up.

I have been to an extreme point I have not showered at all for the past 4 days or washed my face or even brushed my teeth due to my fear. I'm very scared for my mom especially now that I found out today and my Dad also even though he hasn't been doing it and also neither has my little sister since I informed them and always trying to nag to them about it. I'm shaking in fear and my anxiety is through the roof, the brain eating amoeba is a fear for my parents and my sister from me I can't sleep or eat right because everyday I think its there last even though my dad has been following the rules to a T, my mom not so much. She would blow out the water after she sniffs it in her nose like she is rinsing, but still that is a massive risk and on top of that my dad might have done it on Tuesday when we had no notice, but yet the water pressure was low and freezing even though he said he didn't use it. 

My brain has to many fears going through it and I can't stop thinking I will lose my family and I'm just in fear 24/7. Again we don't get our water from wells and stuff but treatment had stopped due to plants not able to process properly and we had to all boil our water. Again we live in a city and our water originally while getting treated did not come from wells. 

But the reason There is so much fear is because god rest there souls we have had people from other areas in texas die from this thing being very rare due to well water and not being treated properly.

I don't know how I can go on like this. Every time I see a teenager or someone in my age group, I am reminded of how they all got away with what they did to me, each and every one of them.

The main reason why I don’t like the house is that I don’t feel safe here. Our last apartment was on the last storey in a tall building and I could be sure no intruder will climb in through the window. There was only one door leading in and out and everything was just in full view. 

Now here, in this house, there are windows everywhere, very accessible and anyone could break them and enter. There’s the front door, back door, basement door, and garage door and I’m constantly stressed about if they’re all locked or maybe someone let something open. 

If I’m on the second floor, I’m thinking all the time if there’s someone on the first floor and I cannot see them. I cannot be home alone at all, because all I can think about are intruders and burglars. It’s difficult for me to sleep at night because every little sound makes me jump.

sometimes my anxiety ignites vomiting, nausea, tightness in stomach, weak legs, mind racing heart beating fast, dry heaving, panic and anxiety attacks... to the point where I started having anxiety about those physical symptoms that I developed fear of food because I’m scared I’ll vomit or get sick..

During these months, I’ve been on and off meaning sometimes I feel nothing like my days are going by and no anxiety or fear is crippling.. other times it takes over.. but I must say that I’ve been dealing with it a bit better than when this anxiety first started I mean it used consume my days.. to the point where I started thinking there is something physically wrong and went to the doctors and got checked.. anyways.. but now I feel more motivated like I work and try to push it aside.

1193,sageflower1855,1613830498,"I have pretty bad social anxiety as well as just general anxiety and depression. My current new job does not involve a lot of interaction with people which would be perfect for me, except it’s still making me anxious. Like getting up and worrying about clocking in on time, walking past coworkers and supervisors a few times a day. Small interactions with people during break times. It all drains me even though logically I know these things are small and the other person is not putting as much stock into these small interactions as I am. My anxiety leaves me feeling drained and like someone has taken sandpaper to my nerves, I feel raw sometimes. It often makes me irritable and I in turn sometimes push away my significant other instead of being able to turn to him because I can’t handle any more social interaction. 

I’d like to keep this job as I’m enjoying the money and keeping busy, but I feel it’s more draining on me than your average person with social anxiety. It makes me frustrated with myself for not being able to handle it as well as I want to.

So my question is, do any of you have any advice on how you deal with anxiety about work. Work burn out. Letting go of work when you’re home, all of that.

Since I was not diagnosed with OCD I didn't want to ""self-diagnose"" so I'm here to make sure I'm not going insane lol.

Basically, my habits are pretty silly, they consume minutes of my day: placing things in a certain way, touching objects before going to bed in the same order, going on different social media apps also in the same order etc.

The one, I would say I hate the most is texting people strictly during a specific time of the day, which is probably rude as hell, but my thoughts are just controlling me. It's like I won't text anyone before 11 am, excluding when a teacher texts me or something. This is extremely frustrating after a while because I can't even enjoy activities that are considered as a way to ease anxiety. (talking to loved ones in this case)

Now, whenever I tried fighting these habits, something inconvenient happened the next day and I connected these. I think it's just me finding another reason why I should just continue the obsession over routines, at this point.

For years I’ve struggled with my mental health and PTSD, and for about 10+ years I dealt with it the only way I’ve know how to, which has primarily been drinking. Heavily. I’m 32 this year, and although 2020 put us all in the ringer, it forced me to really consider what I need to do in order to be “ok.” 

Finally talked to a psychiatrist, and after explaining some of my “episodes,” and my coping mechanisms, she prescribed Buspirone. I’ve always felt weird about prescriptions, but I figured I can’t do this on my own anymore. Plus she said it can help with cravings that happen when a brain starts to spiral and wants things like food, weed, booze. 

I’ve been on it 2 weeks now, and haven’t had a drink. And it’s been easy! I’ve taken off time from alcohol before but it’s like I’m white-knuckling the day away. My anxiety is already much better, and my stubborn/reckless thoughts are more manageable. I feel like I can breath easy, and my days are so much better.

But...I can’t sleep. That’s where booze always helped. (I also have tried weed gummies for sleep, which helps, but would prefer not to rely on them). 

Does anyone experience this on Buspirone? I thought getting off booze would help with my quality of sleep, and I know that’s true, but I’m waking up at 2-3am every morning.

1223,healthcare103,1613816831,"You can see your medical provider or mental health professional. If you are already seeing someone for your anxiety who is aware of your history with the disorder, you may want to continue seeing them for insomnia.

You might believe anxiety is behind your poor sleep, but just in case, your provider will rule out other possible causes first. These can include:

* **Medications.** Certain medications, including popular ones for ADHD, asthma, and pain can cause insomnia. Even antidepressants you may have been prescribed for anxiety can have this side effect.
* **Physical illnesses.** Symptoms of health conditions related to the heart, blood vessels, lungs, thyroid, stomach, and brain can keep you awake at night. 
* **Habit-forming substances.** Alcohol and other drugs with a risk for dependency and addiction, as well as caffeine and nicotine can make it hard to get a good night’s rest.

They may also ask about your daily habits and see if anything about them is making it challenging for you to sleep. For example, traveling frequently for work or working overnights can offset your circadian rhythm (an internal “clock” that regulates your sleep-wake cycle), and eating late in the evenings can lead to acid reflux or discomfort when lying down. Watching TV or being on your computer or phone before you go to bed can also make it hard to fall asleep.

Additionally, your provider may talk to your spouse or partner to get a sense of how you are when you sleep. Some people wake up many times a night due to sleep apnea (a health condition in which your breathing stops and starts during sleep) or have other sleep disorders, such as restless leg syndrome, which creates an uncontrollable urge to move your legs, typically while you are trying to go to sleep. You may not notice some of these, but a partner will.

I’ve always had anxiety and was able to control it.. but after I got covid my anxiety and overthinking doubled.. it started showing as physical symptoms (nausea, tight stomach, no ability to eat, dry heaving, heart and mind racing, weak legs, feeling the world is falling apart).. and because of my fear of vomiting I developed a fear from food.. meaning I become scared to eat and anxiety shoots to the roof when meal time comes because I get scared I will get sick.. and if I get sick I will lose weight and being underweight I don’t want that.. two or a month and a half ago things were bad but slowly I am pushing myself.. I developed safe foods and dangerous foods.. I’m trying to tackle this problem along with OCD and my routine.... 
Before this used to consume all my day.. I used to just google symptoms and think something is wrong with me.. I even went to the doctors and got checked.. but now I feel like I’m more out of my head..
Like I work and I am motivated to do my research and study (as I am planning on taking the bar exam this year) more than 2/1.5 months ago.. back then I used to feel like there is no point in life.. 
but a week ago I got an appointment with a psychiatrist and I told her about what I feel.. she said she could prescribe me a medicine to relief my anxiety and overthinking but she doesn’t feel it’s necessary if I can fight it myself and push harder.. but she can prescribe it anytime for me and I can take it if needed...
So my question is how do I know if I should take it or not?? I mean I feel somedays are good sometimes are bad but even now the bad days aren’t all bad like certain hours feel overwhelming but then I feel fine.... but doesn’t everyone feel that? I do get discouraged when I feel anxiety and symptoms are back as i feel it takes away from progress.. so idk if I should take it or not..",Anxiety,To take or not time medicine is the question? please Help?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lo45b3/to_take_or_not_time_medicine_is_the_question/,1613786861.0

It’s been a month now. 

Today I’m feeling anxious again, replaying in my head, feeling crazy guilty, worried I’m being unfair and horrible to him and telling myself he’s done so much for me and I’m being terrible to him. I feel I keep hurting the people I love and who are there for me and I can’t forgive myself. I hurt his feelings I can’t forgive myself even though he has. He has moved on completely.

1231,mercyinreach,1613813622,"after being fine for two years and not having any anxiety I couldn't solve with deep breaths and a walk, this December some potential health issues, still unanswered due to long appointment wait lists, triggered me into health anxiety that has kept me from sleeping much 

I was prescribed zoloft, and buspar as an as needed. I ended up not being able to take the zoloft because I remembered several years ago I tried it and it made me hallucinate and jittery, human zoomies. 

My psychiatrist told me to just stick with buspar as needed while I'm looking for and going through therapy. That was today.

I'm very sensitive to mental medications so I split the 5mg tab at the line and only took 2.5mg at 6pm. I felt a little strange, for ten minutes I was smiling ear to ear for no reason, that passed, my butt was tingling lmao that passed. Then I was just kinda sleepy and spacy. I didn't like the feeling it gave me but it made me feel a little calmer at least.

Around 2:30-3am I am struggling to sleep, feeling restless, my head hurts, I'm really nauseous, my heart is pounding. But it's not my  anxiety. I don't really get headaches or nausea from my anxiey, just crying, shaking, frequent urination. I didn't feel anxious I just felt sick/hungover. 

I had a hunch it was because of my body lacking buspirone, even though that seems strange because I only took it once. I just want to sleep so I split the 2.5 into half, 1.25mg, and took that, absolutely miniscule even in comparison to the previous miniscule dose. 

And within 15 minutes I'm feeling mostly better, save for sudden dry mouth and my head feeling a bit strange, not pain really, just weird. 

I really cannot understand how even with being sensitive to medication, taking such a miniscule dose could cause me to feel so sick simply because I didn't take it again 'soon enough' after taking it once? 

Disregarding how freakin' weird that is.... How am I supposed to take it as needed if I get withdrawal symptoms 9 hours later? Meh.

 I'm not really interested in seeing how it goes long term, I just need something a couple times a week for the next couple months while I get my silly brain back where it was before I was triggered, buspar is clearly not meant for that. I'll have to see what my psychiatrist is willing to give at my next appointment.

1233,thetruepan,1613812473,"Okay, hi! 
To give you a bit of context, I have been unhappy with my weight for a while now, always trying new methods and diets and exercises to lose weight, which I would usually all regain and then some after a week or two because I can't stick to a routine for shit. That's just how it's always been, and it's a fact that I don't have the discipline it would need for me to really lose weight. 

Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's get to the point. For the past two months or so, I've had a really bad time with anxiety, waking up and going to bed with the same, terrible feeling of nervousness and fear in my entire body. During those two months, I've worried myself sick to the point where I would take bites of food and immediately feel like my stomach doesn't even want food, what made my anxiety worse too. The anxiety doesn't have anything to do with the food per se, neither does the food with my anxiety either, it's just the physical activity of eating that I've been struggling with due to my constant fear and worry. 

Ever since it's been that bad, I've been continueing to lose pound after pound without even really trying to do so. People have started telling me how sick I look ever since. It's not even that I'm not hungry at all, because I am, it's just...whenever I am in the process of eating or making food, it feels like my stomach tightens and my throat closes up, as if I was physically unable to really get any, or just very little food down my throat. And when I do eat a normal portion of food, I'll feel sick for hours after, making me not feel like eating again that day. 

And even though I am somehow still happy about losing weight (it's really been a struggle for me to do so, so just the reassurance that it's possible for me feels good), I don't want to lose any more weight. Not because I am now magically happy with myself and my body, but because it's always making me worry that I am physically ill and I'm gonna die in a day or so, making the anxiety worse and making me eat even less...it's truely a viscious circle. 

Only a few people I'm really close to know about this issue, and some even tell me to just be happy that I'm losing weight, but they don't understand what it feels like to have panic attacks over not getting a piece of toast down my throat. 

I've previously gone to the doctor to get me checked out for that stuff, especially since I had been experiencing even more, scary symptoms of bad anxiety. Even though my body is apparently physically okay, my mind still tells me that I probably have terrible illnesses and I'm gonna die in my sleep anyways, making me not want to do that really either. It's truely been quiete the struggle...

Anyways, thank you, whoever decided to read this little (okay pretty long, actually) rant...has anyone else ever experience food struggles as a symptom of anxiety? If yeah, how did/do you cope with it?

Okay, I’m posting again. My apologies. I am just having a rough few days. I have moderate social anxiety that has been leaning towards severe the past few days and social cues have been incredibly incomprehensible for me. I am hoping for kind folks here to help me see things objectively.

So, I posted that there has been a texting mishap with my new SO two days ago and we sorted it out. I was still feeling anxious for some reason but I tend to find a new thing to be anxious about every time so I figured this is just a case of it.

I decided to ask him out to a cute date tomorrow. I asked him if he wanted to go ice skating with me again or build a blanket fort, and he said he wanted to do both. He seemed excited. But I found out from his Facebook page around 8 pm (he knows I follow his professional page - he’s dabbling into broadcasting) that he’s on air tomorrow evening/night. 

I have always been super supportive of his hobby and am a fan of his broadcasts! It is just I thought we were spending the night together because that’s what we always do and he didn’t even let me know he’s planning to work the night until around midnight! He asked if we can meet early afternoon. I am quite irritated on top of anxious by then but tried to stay calm and told him it’s okay but I thought he was doing his thing in the afternoons as usual. And he told me he’s still trying to figure out what the “usual” is. 

I always look forward to our weekends and I think he does as well - but this response didn’t sit well with me. Granted, I like planning things way ahead because having things planned out gives me some sort of calmness. He can also be an anxious person but he is extremely spontaneous and plans things last minute. We both learned to compromise and he usually confirms plans at the end of work day on Fridays (we verbalize that we will see each other next weekend at the end of each date).

1258,plsdontinsultme,1613803206,"Hi all. I’m terribly sorry if this is not cool to post here. Dating question.

Keeping this short. Met a girl, she indicated high interest for 2 weeks. In talking, she says she has very bad anxiety and depression. Sometimes doesn’t respond to people all day due to it. 

We FaceTime a few times, keep talking. Eventually we meet, had a great first meet. Great convo, relatable, not weird - it was all great. 

She said things that indicated we would keep seeing each other. Also said she’d like to meet again. 

Got sexual at the end - but was expected, as we talked about sex a lot beforehand. 

I text two days later. No response. 3 days after that, I txt just saying hi. Nothing. 4 days later, “everything okay?.” Nothing. 

It eventually became 2 weeks. I assume I have been ghosted - which for me was crushing, confusing. 

I send a friendly text saying that no matter what was going on, I understood and respected it - &amp; that I’d give her space. My door was open, I said, and no harm done. 

2d later, she does reply. She apologized, and said she just felt uncomfortable and shy for a while after. 

 I said I empathized &amp; understood - and apologized if it was my fault. I told her to lmk how she feels re. the relationship whenever she felt ready to. 


Now it’s been a few more days, and no reply. 


My initial thought: ghosted, no interest, must be something about me - no matter how little sense it would make. 

Have since realized that it *may* be due to depression/anxiety. For her to lose interest just makes 0 sense. 

So my question(s):

Could it be that she likes me but fears getting too attached or abandoned? 

Or that she feels unworthy/undeserving after physically meeting? 

Or it’s b/c after meeting in person, and now knowing me not just online but as a human — she’s embarrassed or something?

Or that fear and shame from depression have made it difficult to respond now after we’ve become intimate? 

Please offer any insight even if not based on those questions. Thank U!

hi everyone, hope you're doing well!

so i kinda need a bit of help here. i'm an 18 year old guy who just happens to be a big ol loner. i've barely ever had any friends at all and i'm really really shy and i have some pretty bad anxiety (it also doesn't help that i'm an aspie lol.) this is how i've been my whole life basically, always by myself, alone in my room all day, typical introvert stuff (to be clear, i do have 2 very close irl friends that i've known for *years* that i love dearly, but i barely talk to them anymore unfortunately since we really only hanged out at school. we do call and text sometimes though and they do matter a lot to me.)

basically this loneliness i've had for a long time has been completely eating me up lately, more than ever. i've never felt more alone and i keep wishing that i had someone to talk to more and more every day.

what i want to get to right now is the fact that i'm completely jealous of people who have great friends online, and not just great friends but a whole friend group. **(by the way i forgot to mention that i've basically given up on making irl friends at this point, not only because of the pandemic but also because i don't go anywhere anyway)** back to my point, it really pains me seeing people like for example on twitter talking to their friends and having fun and whatever while i'm just sitting here lurking all day, maybe Smashing That Like Button on 1 or 2 posts that make me laugh sometimes (i also only have 1 follower who happens to be inactive, cool guy though) i really want to be like those people, having someone they can talk to, about their interests, their lives, have fun with, and maybe voice chat on discord or whatever.

sometimes when i'm bored on twitter i look at a tweet that i liked, go to that person's profile and be like ""hey this person's nice, they're into stuff i like and i really relate to them! i really wanna be their friend!"" but i'm like if i were to DM them or something that would probably be realllly weird cuz like they'd probably be thinking that this random 1 follower mf with no connection to anyone they know just DMs them saying they like their posts...... idk dude. as a surprise to no one, i never end up DMing anyone and i just go watch youtube or some shit lol, this is of course after i realize that they happen to have a bunch of also really cool people as friends (that they've probably known for years by the way) that i will probably never talk to! it sucks!

so....... does anyone have any advice for me please? me sending a DM to someone would already be a serious accomplishment but i really don't see that happening, and me making a friend as a result of that? pretty much impossible i think. any comment would really be appreciated for real though.

by the way, if you've got this far into my post THANK YOU SO MUCH. i really appreciate that you took the time out of your day to read my long-ass badly written sad post basically almost begging for help.

It can evolve to anger, which then makes me throw and break stuff/beat stuff that I regret doing later. So I guess this also applies to anger management, which I also have a problem with sometimes. 

I'm 20 years old and a senior in college. I have a plush of Kirishima and Midoriya from My Hero Academia, Ryuji from Persona 5, and Hinata from Haikyuu (really into anime). I only really tell and show my best friends about them or bring them to conventions. Anyone else I'm too embarrassed to tell or show. 

I've tried things like stress balls and pillows to let out the physical tension but it only feeds it. If I feel a night where I'm getting tense and it's only escalating, I just hold one of my plushes in my hand. It makes me not wanna squish the plush because I like it, so I detense and then get to breathe. Once I breathe, I get back into my comfort zone, and I prevent a spiral. 

Does anyone else do this with plushes/stuffed animals? Is it a weird way to help treat it at my age, or if it works, should I just roll with it?

1266,winter_moons,1613799088,"I started taking Buspar earlier this week and today is the 5th day. I was prescribed 10mg 2 times per day but I decided to ease myself into it with the hope of avoiding side effects and start with 5mg 2 times per day. I’ve never been prescribed any anxiety meds, and only took OTC CBD oil before. 

The first 3 days I felt great, a little foggy for about an hour after taking it but it wasn’t anything I couldn’t deal with. I was so happy and excited to keep feeling great and finally get a handle on my anxiety. I should have knocked on wood, though 

Yesterday, however, i felt nauseous, tired and anxious and today I’ve been very nervous the entire day. When I’m not on medication my anxiety doesn’t act that way, even if I have a bad day it comes and goes in waves and eases up at night, so I know it’s the meds. I messaged my doctor yesterday to ask about easing into it and he said to increase to the prescribed 10 mg twice a day if the 5mg stopped working,  but I’m afraid that will only make the side effects worse. 

I know it’s only day 5 of my first anxiety medication ever and these side effects are probably mild comparatively but I feel a bit hopeless about it.  Like I said, the lightheadedness I can deal with but the fact it’s making my anxiety worse is very discouraging. I feel obligated to keep taking it for some reason but how long am I supposed to put up with this? And if I can’t even handle such a small dose of what I’ve heard described as a ‘beginner’ anxiety med what am I supposed to do? I don’t want to go on benzos because of the addiction risk and I don’t want to go on SSRIs because of what seem like worse side effects. 

I also don’t want to take my CBD oil with Buspar since I have no idea how it will react, and I’ve heard it can react like grapefruit can and make the side effects worse.

1268,galacticaf,1613798606,"I think this is why developed some social anxiety. From a young age people always had something to say about me. Even though these comments have stopped, I can’t stop thinking about my physical appearance.


As a kid, I was extremely skinny. I often heard I looked like a walking stick. Members of my family would grab my wrist and do circle around it with their thumb and index finger just to gawk at the empty space. They would do this often even though, clearly, nothing would be different.


When I got to middle school the bullying got really, really bad. If someone had a negative opinion about me, they made sure I heard it. It was usually a comment about how skinny I am, how ugly I am, and how fragile I look. People I didn’t even know bagged on me. The bullying ranged from stealing my stuff, throwing trash at me, name calling, explicitly stating how ugly I am to me, or even just passive actions like holding the door open for class and saying “pretty girls only” until I approached and then they just shut it. I don’t remember much of it anymore but I remember the pain and humiliation I felt. I started skipping school a lot.


Today, I am at a normal weight range for my height and age, but I still think about my appearance all the time. When I go out, meet someone, speak to someone, I feel like I’m sorry they have to look at me. I’m sorry I’m here taking up your visual space, I’m sorry I ruined your day with my face, I promise I’ll be gone soon. And when I get home and catch glimpses of myself in the mirror I feel so disappointed. I look at my body and I always find something to hate about it. I hate that most of my fat gathers at my stomach and breasts, well maybe I like the breast. But I hate that my belly has grown. I hate that I didn’t stop to enjoy being skinny, even though by most standards I still am. I try to eat healthy and develop a good exercise regime, but then my thoughts all filled with “don’t develop an eating disorder”, “don’t work your body until you’re bones again”, even though all I want to do is gain strength! Yes, I want to slim my belly, but I want to be strong! I want to be a fire bending prince! But I find it hard when I look at myself and feel shame. I know at least some people find me attractive, I’m even in a relationship. But I just can’t find myself attractive. At least, not right now. And it doesn’t help that I got a horrible haircut a while back and am in the irritating process of growing it out. Maybe that’s why I’ve been so hard on myself again.


There was a time in my life where I felt I had it all. I saw myself as hot and confident, but only for about a year. I was eating right and working out at that time. Right now I’m a wimp scared of everything and focused on my appearance. I keep telling myself, “no one cares as much as I do”, but it’s just hard right now.

They have treated me like I’m crazy...like I am less than...and not worthy of support. I’ve always had problems with Rxs because of this...I even have trouble taking them regularly to this very day for this very reason. 

I tell myself they’re doctors, they’re pharmacists....they understand people need medicine...but some of them....Christ, if you see a patient’s list of meds for mental illness, why would you feel okay attacking that person??

I’ve had so many terrible things happen during this pandemic. Immediate family dying alone in an empty hospital room, a major stroke in the family, our small business is just barely staying alive....

It’s been such an excruciating low point it lead to a break through.  There are things I HAVE to do now. If medicine can help, I can continue to be there for my Dad and hopefully help save our small business...it’s time to give medicine the fully try.  

Talked to my doctor yesterday and he added a new Rx to go with the two I usually get (but take very sparingly because I have a meds “thing”)...I know, I’m an idiot. 

Well today, I got a call from a big chain pharmacy. (The one I’ve used for years.) Thought it was a call to say my Rxs were ready...but no. There was a man, I’m guessing the head pharmacist. Once I got on my phone, and for the next 5 minutes, he questioned the medicines, the amounts, and the credibility of my Doctor. (I used to live in California, and due to years of trust building with him, he stayed my Dr on videophone when I move cross country. This is very common these days.)

I understand my Rxs may seem confusing to someone who is not my Doctor or me, but I’ve been working with him for 15 years - and there was no part of me that wants to tell a complete fucking stranger the reasonings behind my medicines. My voice stayed hollow, I kept apologizing, saying I’d call my Doctor, and I absolutely hate that I kept thanking him for letting me know of the problem...and he kept on talking....telling me I need to find a new local Doctor....in the middle of a pandemic. That he doesn’t fill Rxs for Doctors he doesn’t know. 

I stayed as hollow and friendly sounding as I could because I knew a huge attack was about to hit when I hung up. 

And BOOM. I was undone...fucking wrecked...there were no words for it....


I don’t know what that pharmacist’s goal was today. I hope he though he was stopping flagrant drug trafficking or something like that. I know if he would had seen me just two minutes after hanging up, he would have....he would have known without doubt that I was a real patient. 

My heart feels broken. This just reinforces for me that fear that most people, even those in heathcare, don’t give a shit about those with mental illness. 

I know that’s not true. I know it. I know some people really do care, but I just have the worst kind of luck running into people who truly make me wish for all of this to end. 

I’m so tired. I so wish I could be normal for everyone. 

You know, I never complain....and yet here I am.  I’m sure I’ll delete this later. No good ever comes from complaining.  I just don’t want the people who love me to see or hear how this has wiped me down to nothing again.  

That leaves the great internet void. 

I’ll drop my internet tears right here on the anxiety forum....because sharing , even with strangers, makes that dark hole in my chest feel a tiny bit better.  

I am so down and defeated right now. My one silver lining is maybe someone out there is feeling stripped low right now too, and by reading this it might help them realize they’re not alone.

What if my yellow brick road is a winding maze with only dead ends and foggy paths that exist only to deliver false hope. Sometimes, I don’t even feel like I’m walking anymore. I’m stood on a patch of grass with the endless blades of greenery as my only company. At least before hand I felt I was moving, I might have been lost but I was doing something. However in these country side moments I’m not even lost anymore, I’m swallowed by confusion until I’m drawn to a halt. I am consumed by the absurdity of existence.

- I have a dog run in my backyard and used to have intrusive thoughts of finding one of my dogs dead back there. One day, I found my 9-year Pomeranian gone there.

- Was in a 3-year relationship, had regular fears that he would leave once I finally felt comfortable in the relationship. When I found out I was pregnant with our child, he told me he didn't love me and left.

- I was fortunate to have a healthy pregnancy and baby, but I had some pre-existing conditions and was terrified that I wouldn't make it through labor. I ended up having an expedited delivery that caused a fragmented placenta, hemorrhage, and a seizure while I was holding my baby for the first time. I was hospitalized for 5 days.

- Went through a lot post-birth and all I really had was my baby. Became terrified that something would happen and I would lose her too. At 12 weeks old, she lost consciousness and turned blue. Had to call 9-1-1 and we were hospitalized. Thank God she is okay now.

- I am super terrified of being judged and take tons of stupid precautions to avoid it...still got verbally attacked by ex-MIL last week for my house being messy and living in a ""dangerous neighborhood"".

I'm sure you know the planet is pretty f*cked up at this point, but I didn't realize it was literally *right* now or never until I got a notification about a climate report the UN released recently. I can't find the exact link I read (it was good because it had bullet points of the most important points) but [this](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/02/18/americas/un-report-climate-making-peace-intl/index.html) references the same report.

I just feel like curling up in a corner and crying. 

I'm 15. It's projected that the average life expectancy will be ~80 in 2060, so I think it's reasonable I'll live till about that age if I stay healthy. So that would mean I'll live to roughly 2085. By 2100, the report I was talking about said the tempature of Earth will have increased by 3.0°C. What's even better is the ice is melting at *the* worst case scenario, along with a few other things. 

My generation is literally going to be running from preventable natural disasters and trying to work in whatever kind of economy they leave behind. And that's a brighter outlook; worst case we're in another world war where food is scarce because the soil is *literally* dead.

The thought of breaking up with him fills me with dread and horror. Like I physically feel sick. But last night I had a dream that I cheated on him (with someone who I'm not even attracted to). This is not the first time this has happened but I never took it seriously until now. I talked to him this mroning and nothing felt different, it was the usual. But then I got a text from a classmate that I am physically attracted to and I got giddy. I then remembered my dream and was filled with dread. Now I can't stop obsessively thinking about how I am not actually attartced to my bf. Every time I try to recall a warm fuzzy memory, I feel sick and get these intrusive thoughts. I woild call him, but he is sleeping in his time zone. I am convinced that I will never see my bf the same way again. And this is killing me.

In the past, I have had very toxic ""relationships"" that always ended quickly. I had really bad self esteem and threw myself at guys who gave me attention. Of course this never ended well. I am worried that i am with him because of all the terrible men I encountered before him. And not because he is the right person for me.

I know this sounds like I'm not into him, but that's not the case at all. I have opened up to him in ways that I can't imagine opening up to anyone else, even very close friends.

Been at my job for 7 years now. Have had a few ups and downs but today for the first time ever I was reprimanded. Long story short without getting into details that nobody would really understand, recently I was taking a ""shortcut"" so to speak, and a rather innocent one, with some of my work, and another co-worker, a woman who I work closely with caught onto it. When she asked me about it I was very honest with her and explained why I was doing it (to save time). It should be noted that what I was doing had **zero** real effect on her. Within a half an hour I was in shock as I was being reprimanded by my two bosses, being told that this was a verbal warning for what I did.

I took complete responsibility and apologized, while also saying I know it was wrong to do. But what's bothering me even more than being caught and disciplined, is knowing the pure evil of the woman who basically instantly ratted me out to my bosses and destroyed me today. Never once had a bad word with this person and if anything had a decent relationship work wise. Never any personal convos and no I wouldn't trust her too far in general but this did shock me.

I'm struggling with two key things anxiety wise:

1- The black cloud that is now over me with my bosses knowing that I didn't follow protocol and did something I shouldn't have been doing

2- How on earth am I supposed to continue working with the insane woman who threw me under the bus and tarnished my image today forever 

I feel low. Very low. To the point where I'm feeling every emotion in the book from being a failure to having extreme anger towards this woman. I've been wanting to get a new job within the company (it's a huge company with all sorts of different departments) for a long while now and even came close just before covid, but to me this has been the wake up call knowing that I need to get out.

This was caused by what I belive might have been a vicorious thrauma or something similar that I experienced for about a year ago, where I had crippling anxieties and nightmares all the time bc I talked to a girl ik irl who had very similar issues as me and never got the help she needed, just like me, sadly. This crushed me to the point where I could not function normally. Every single day I was stuck in her issues. Just could not get it out of my mind. It got to the point where I almost committed self deletus bc it was so unbearble. I couldn't even enjoy myself without feeling guilty. It's the worst anxiety I've ever been through in my entire life, and I am terrified that that will happen again. I ended up leaving her bc it got too much for me. After this I've been struggling alot with getting anxieties and getting stuck in others issues whenever ik they're in pain or somehow overhear something sensitive, until ik they're fine or some time has passed so I eventually put it behind me naturally. This also makes me very depressive and shaky like crazy. It's like I kinda recieve their feelings. Somehow I don't have the same reaction online tho, perhaps bc I don't know nor has met pple online irl, idk :o 

It's friking unbearble and makes rly difficult for me to function socially as there will always be people aroun with issues and bad days no matter where you go.

I remember once I found a drawing at a mental instutution where whoever made it was clearly desperate for help, I ended up having a rly bad anxiety attack when I saw it and did not sleep very well that night. 

And yes, ik others happiness isn't my responbillity and that I can't help everyone, but I just can't help it. I can't control it.

If there is anybody who has similar issues who managed to find a way to cope with it and/or overcome it, how did you do it? I'll take any advice I can get bc I cannot bear to live like this much longer. I honestly don't know what to do bc I can't find a reliable way to cope with it, and yes I have talked to proffessionals, but they do not seem to know any ways to cope with it either.

1322,huygigh,1613779649,"So I deal with a handful of mental disorders: adhd, social anxiety, and depression. Recently, I read an argument somewhere that compared anxiety with a physical disability. To paraphrase, it essentially asked: How come we don't expect people in wheelchairs to get up and walk yet we expect people with social anxiety to speak in public?

To me, the comparison makes a lot of sense. For one, anxiety is permanent in the same way some physical disabilities are. The best we can do is learn to manage it and try to limit it's impediment on our daily life, much in the same way as suffers of a physical disability. And two, anxiety does have physical consequences. It can place stress on your body. While exposure therapy can be helpful, being in a situation that is too overwhelming, I believe, can cause more harm than good.

And yet, because our struggles are mental and not physical (except the consequences of stress), we are mostly overlooked and expected to function the same as everyone else. In college, I'm still expected to give speeches in front of a class, I will still be expected to go to interviews to get a job, and I will still have to give presentations in front of coworkers. I am forced to face all these things that trigger my anxiety, and yet still, no one has asked a person in a wheelchair to walk.

So I'm curious what your thoughts on this are. Should society be more mindful of and lenient with anxiety, or is the responsibility on us to find a way to ""get over it""?",Anxiety,Should mental disorders such as anxiety be treated more in the same way as a physical disability by society?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lnu9ce/should_mental_disorders_such_as_anxiety_be/,1613750849.0
1323,FiguringItOut--,1613779635,"I do customer service for a relatively popular start-up. I actually love my job a lot, it's mostly emails, sometimes texts/returning voicemails at a super chill company. It's the voicemails that get me, and it really makes no sense. I now do VMs like half a day 1-2x a week, while at my last job, I was on live calls all day most days. I'm actually really good on the phone, but I have such terrible anxiety when I know I have to return calls and talk to people. Like, I barely ate today, because my anxiety was so bad. But the thing is, today was a good day! It almost always is. I'll usually talk to a sweet, grateful lady who gives me compliments, I help people solve problems and surprise them with good service they aren't expecting. I'm good at my job, and I have literally never been yelled at (at this company). And what's fucking *crazy* is that when I *do* get someone who's really upset, I'm very good at calming them down. At my last job, I saved an angry lady from cancelling, and she wrote my boss a 10 paragraph essay about how wonderful I was! What the fuck am I anxious about returning calls one afternoon a week!?

The anxiety is completely untethered to reality. I concoct these ""what-ifs"" that never come to pass. I have to remind myself almost every day. I'm trying to change how I talk to myself, so lately, I've been trying to hype myself up about the phones. Most of my life, I would have spent today shitting on myself for being anxious, because I know it's stupid and useless and I want to be different. But I've found changing the way I react to my own anxiety has had a *significant* impact on how I actually feel. So instead of shitting on myself, I said things like: I know you're really anxious. That's ok. You're gonna have a good day, you're gonna talk to some sweet lady and be pleasantly surprised as always. You're gonna get through this.""

I dunno, it's been more effective than anything else I've tried. It certainly doesn't always work, and it can be tough when you aren't used to doing it, but it's been helpful so maybe it could help someone else. **Be kinder to yourself. Even with anxiety, you deserve it!**

I've been to countless visits to a gastro doctor, and have been totally lost for years. I get extremely bloated to where I can barely walk at outings (going to a store, a school event pre-covid, my friend's party) and usually have to leave early even when I'm excited to go to an event. I feel as if I experience bloating and bm issues really often. I remember this problem starting when I was around 12, so it's been ongoing for years. This probably sounds stupid, but I get low grade fevers during ""flare ups"" when my stomach is really bad for about a week. I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I know for a fact I've always had pretty bad social anxiety and just anxiety in general.

I've done blood tests, stool tests, ultrasounds, seen an allergist, tests for bacteria like h pylori...yet everything is normal. It's good to not have a condition, but pretty upsetting to not have answers besides anxiety. These ""flare ups"" I've been getting were not happening as often until about a month after my dad died last summer. Since then, maybe about for a week every month or two months, I've been in poor health with the symptoms described above. Before his passing, I would rarely get this bad.

Some knowledge: I'm female, a teen, and don't do drugs/drink. Also, no, this is not just PMS.

I'm just looking to see if anyone has experienced anything similar to this since I feel incredibly alone. It really sucks having to leave places early when I'm having fun while my friends are all fine. None of my friends have this problem, and I feel like I'm the only one struggling with this sometimes. Does anyone else have this problem? Have you had worsened anxiety for a long time after a loved one's passing?

Whether my heart is too fast, is it beating too strong, did it skip a beat, did it flutter or stop for a second because it felt that way, am I having an arrhythmia because my heart increased fast, why am I getting short of breathe, why am I lightheaded,why do I feel like I'm gonna pass out, why is my throat closing up. All this starts happening if I let my mind worry me. I crave and desire to play what I have played from 7 y.o. to 20 y.o. (with zero issues btw) which is when anxiety started kicking my ass. I am 22 y.o. in two weeks and I am barely re starting soccer again. I wanted to start full force because I thought I was still a beast, but I got to accept im a beginner all over again after no exercise for almost two years. It sucks, my heart is obviosuly not conditioned and the smallest sprint sends my heart to the moon. This causes a great deal of anxiety. I get extremely worried about what my body is doing and whether ima pass out or drop unconscious or something. I have seen several cardiologists, done every test for clearance and I am still extremely scared. Sometimes I go for a run and feel great.

1345,AdventurousStaff9966,1613774177,"I have a long history of exercising and anxiety. I am mid-30s, in good shape, with a workout routine that over the past few years has consistently included heavy compound lifts 3 days per week (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench) with mild to moderate cardio (no more than 15 minutes of jogging 3 to 4 days of week). So fairly intense, but nothing like the people going to the gym 5 or 6 days per week and mixing lots of cardio with heavy lifting. For more background, my heart has been stress tested with echocardiogram and is totally fine. I've also been tested for asthma no issue. Bloodwork is fine. 

My anxiety mostly pertains to physical symptoms - I seem to have a heightened awareness of various feelings and they can spiral quickly. My current issue is as follows. Yesterday I had my most intense workout of the week. I did squats, bench, and row, with 15 minutes of jogging after. I felt totally fine during my workout, as I usually do. However, today I go to shovel and my legs are shaky and weak. And suddenly I feel an urgent need for the toilet and like I might faint. I just feel out of it.

For some reason typing this doesn't seem to do justice to how bad it feels, and I feel embarrassed to type it out. I just have this feeling like if I keep shoveling, something horrible will happen. So I do stop. I always do what this happens. But then I obsess over the whole episode. Like lots of people get shaky legs...why do I feel like I am dying when this occurs? I really want to know what would happen if I carried on during these episodes. For some reason I feel like I have to stop to protect myself. Surely I wouldn't die or faint if I continued.

As I mentioned, I've already seen the doctor numerous times. There do not appear to be underlying health issues. Does anyone experience anything like this? 

It happens in other contexts as well. I've gone on hikes with friends on lifting days. And for some reason the post workout fatigue mixed with the relatively low intensity act of hiking on a paved path causes these intense feelings. It's almost impossible to believe it's just anxiety and there is nothing wrong with my health (even though I've been assured my health is fine). 

How do you cope in these situations? Surely the answer can't always be to rush home or go to the ER. I was out with my kid today and itching to get back inside because of the strange feelings after shoveling. That makes me feel really disappointed in myself. 

I guess it would just help to hear about others' experience with this.

so i had a pretty traumatic thing happen to me about 2 years ago where I got misdiagnosed (as my therapist &amp; psych now say) with schizophrenia. since then I'm obsessed with actually getting it. my life's never been the same; it follows me every single day, every waking hour.

so i do have these symptoms; i'd be glad if you could go through them and tell me what u think (-:

hallucinations; when i walk around a corner, i see (?) somebody standing there for the flash of a second. i got no idea if i really see it, since it's usually super short.

i feel like everybody talks shit about me, judges me for everything i do; even though I KNOW they don't...

sometimes, when i stare at walls, trees, etc. my brain instantly finds patterns that look like faces, bodies, ..

after a long day, sometimes also when I've worked a lot, i keep having the people i talked to, worked with, in my head. it's like a song stuck in my head.

in some way all this reminds me of schizophrenia, but somewhat it doesn't really fit the desease?

Basically I’ve been going on a chat site and it just has 150-200 people and I’m a bit popular there. 

I used to have my own selfies as my profile pic there, I haven’t told anyone my name there so I’m pretty sure no one really knows my name.

I even reverse image searched all my pictures I ever used on there and nothing comes up. I’m just anxious that someone will find my real name there and I don’t want that (the internet can be scary and I don’t wanna risk anything)

1386,pinkhorse27,1613762126,"Hi everyone, 

I signed and accepted a job offer last week that I am really excited about. I was furloughed and then laid off in August of last year due to COVID so I was searching for a new job for a very long time. 

Ever since I signed my offer I have been consumed with fear and anxiety that it will be taken away from me. It is leading to a lot of unhealthy spiraling. Calling references? My former boss will probably say I lied on my resume. Background check? What if I committed a crime that I don't know about. Education verification? My college degree probably isn't real. I am able to talk myself out of believing these things for a moment but then they crop right back up, or I think of a new fear-based problem to worry about. 

I feel like I am probably sort of traumatized by the past year, being unemployed was a stressful and embarrassing position to be in for so long. What I'm experiencing feels akin to imposter syndrome, but I can't emphasize enough how *real* the possibilities I described above feel in the moment. It has taken my future manager about a week to send me my onboarding forms and I am convinced it is because he no longer wants to hire me. Even now as I type this out I am convinced I will feel stupid for chalking it up to anxiety when it probably IS true that he will email me later today rescinding the offer.

1388,meadowjay,1613761854,"For some background, I am a senior in high school. I have been online for the last three years, mostly due to anxiety and health issues. When I entered high school in 9th grade, I decided to enter the honors level classes. I had the grades, and at the time, I worked for every single one of them, even if it meant studying and getting extra help more than any of my peers. I was determined to do well regardless of my learning challenges, (I had a 504 plan, so I was never considered for harder classes anyway). 

I was pleased to put the work in, get the grades, and feel accomplished in myself, (this is like the only time I ever felt proud of myself, really).  Even after I switched to online schooling, I was still pretty dedicated because I was now allowed to take even harder classes, ones I had no chance of taking in the past. It was going well for a while, until very slowly and gradually, as it often does, my mental health sank to it's lowest. I really did not think it could get any lower at the time, but it did.

Between this all, I was pushed to stop taking my medications because they ""seemed to no longer benefit me"", as I was having only moderate, pretty much average anxiety, and no longer saw my therapist since she moved. Being not-so mentally mature and self-trusting, I just went with that without much thought. Maybe my doctors were right, and I was just coddling myself. 

That wasn't true though, because my medication/therapy did help me get through this, and situations I wasn't even aware that I was in, (living with my addict brother, washed up cousin, overall stress to my surroundings). I realize that now, back on it and doing much better. 

For my last semester of high school, I decided to drop the honors courses, and just focus on healing myself. Gosh, do I feel good! I honestly felt like the title of ""honors"" held me back so much. I had gotten to the point where I was too afraid to join class discussions because I did not feel worthy of the ""honors"" level work. That is just dumb thinking, but irrelevant. In class I am now back to participating at my fullest, leading discussion, and taking back the passion I once had to get my work done. Now, I can speak opening up to my teachers without fear of judgment, in order to be the best student I can be in my last few months.  

I am back in therapy and finally speaking my truth. Everyday I am working on my hobbies I never developed because of stress and shame. School is no longer my end-all, be-all.  Finally, I am starting to feel like a person, and not just a void of panic. I didn't realize I was stunting myself- biting off more than I can chew, and just not living for myself in those situations I now recognize as the past. I let everything build up until I simply couldn't live in it anymore, and while I know that is not good, I am learning, and every day creating a better reality. 

Everyone's experiences differ. Know this is only a small percentage of mine, and that it took much pain to get here. I don't want to focus on that right now though, and while I am riding my wave, I just want to share my progress. This reflection was inspired by having a phone call with my English teacher that didn't result in a panic attack. If you even read this word vomit, I thank you for taking time out of your busy day to acknowledge my progresses in some form on this internet world. &lt;3",Anxiety,I am making decisions to better myself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lnnulj/i_am_making_decisions_to_better_myself/,1613733054.0

I was finally able to overcome my severe social anxiety after college, when I took a retail management position that forced me to get out of my comfort zone.

If I had this diagnosis sooner would things be different? I am penning this article to challenge all my anxious humans to proactively manage your anxiety.  I hope you find this helpful or at least insightful.
I've never been incredibly social; however, I have always been aggressive in pursuing a successful career and I felt that made me social.  I could articulate business needs and present recommendations projects with the best of them. I spent 30 plus hours a week pitching idea on calls with 10, 20, 30+ participants.  That was social enough for me.  On the weekends, I enjoyed outings with my family and an occasional acceptance of an invite from my girlfriends to a Friday night unwinding session.  I knew I wasn't great at accepting those invites, but hey...I'm incredibly busy, right?
In my 20's, a few doctors’ appointments resulted in trying various medications for insomnia, depression, anxiety, etc.... I never really thought of myself as having any of these issues, so I would typically try something for a few weeks and be done with it.  What I did know was that visiting the doctor’s office really stressed me out, so if I could avoid it, I was winning! They say some people have ""White Coat Syndrome"", where just visiting a doctor makes you anxious...I was okay with self-diagnosing that for me. During these same years, my career was growing, and I really love my work, so things were proceeding as planned.  Business travel was not a problem; Presenting at meetings was a daily activity and honestly, I enjoyed it.
In my 30's, a few doctors’ appointments resulted in me trying a few other things, which never stick.  My number one complaint: redness.  I would meet with my doctor and let him know that I was really getting warm, turning red and getting splotches on my neck and chest, any time I was met with general adversity.  That adversity could be an awkward question from a friend, a rare in person encounter with coworkers, a large group of people, even family...but it wasn't that I was uncomfortable with the meetings, I was just incredibly uncomfortable knowing that I was turning red for what felt like no reason at all. The doctor never really said anything about a diagnosis, but we tried a few things, and nothing got better.
Fast forward to my late 30's... I’ve been working from home for years and I love it.  I raised my kids while having a very successful career and hardly ever leaving the house.  I've gotten a little worse at travel...the last time I had to fly, I almost passed out on the plane. When I got to my work destination, I almost passed out in a huddle meeting with about 10 people. I've been diagnosed with an auto-immune disease, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  I'm thinking I'm just incredibly nervous that someone will notice my ailment and that is likely driving my stress. It takes me a few years to convince myself to seek treatment for psoriasis, but I do eventually get treatment and it makes a world of difference. I am so happy that I can go in public or even in my home and not worry about being judged for this ridiculous disease.  The medicine is an immunosuppressant, so that’s stressful, but it’s worth the risk.
Now I am 40. I'm taking an immunosuppressant, feeling a little nervous about it, but still so happy with the results.  Boom...in walks in a global health crisis, COVID-19.  Now, I am a nervous wreck. I'm pretty sure I am going to die, but of what? Corona, Anxiety or my Immune suppressant.  I just keep going.  I don't want to stop the medicine.... they say if you stop, it will not work again a second time and I feel like I really have a better life with the medicine. With the pandemic, everyone is working from home and that’s really a normal occurrence for me....so we just keep trucking along.  Now I am taking a work phone call...remember, I've been doing this for 20 years now, and I start getting red, splotches and dizzy.  What in the world.  I probably just need some rest. Day 2, same thing.  Day 3, same thing.  Two weeks later, same thing. I'm getting overwhelmed, but my workload hasn't really changed.  What is going on.  I schedule a doctor’s appointment.  It typically takes me weeks to convince myself I need a doctor’s appointment...you know, White Coat Syndrome.  I tell the doctor, remember when I used to say I get nervous and red in uncomfortable situations.... well now every situation is uncomfortable, including things I have been doing for 20 years, help!
Present day, I am taking some strong anxiety medicine.  I have an official diagnosis of social anxiety and I am just trying desperately to get back to some semblance of normal.  Had I known that my anxiety was behind the scenes growing worse and worse over the last 20 years, I think I would have done some things differently.  I should have said yes to more outings, I should have said yes to more presentations, I should have used the webcam more often.  My public service announcement is simply this: If you are an anxious person, making yourself comfortable by pulling back from anxiety is not the answer.  You must push yourself to engage, to be comfortable...otherwise I think the anxiety will find you where you are and keep you from the basic needs of living.  I hope I can find my way back to the basic living that I took for granted. I also truly hope our healthcare system becomes more proactive in caring for us.  It's hard enough for us to make the appointment.... but if it doesn't, don't forget to advocate for yourself.  Push for your best you!

1394,TraditionalAd2541,1613760404,"I have been (and still am) dealing with extreme anxiety attacks during these past few months, all stemming from my phobia of being cancelled in the future. After deeply reflecting on my teen years and witnessing a massive wave of public figures get cancelled in 2020 (i.e. Mini Ladd, Cosmodore, Cryaotic, ZeRo, Fedmyster), I have been dealing with the crippling fear that I will be next one day.

I'll admit, I have done a few ""cancellable"" things during my adolescence, both online and offline. Now, I will tell you that what I have done is not NEARLY AS BAD was what Mini Ladd or ZeRo did (I have never committed a crime in my life nor gotten away with one), but can still be considered cancellable to the public eye. I also won't specify how many cancellable things I did or what they were (for privacy reasons), but I will say that they are very few and far between (first instance happened when I was 13, last instance happened when I was 17).

What I can say with confidence is that I have matured and improved myself as a person since then. I'm no Mr. Rogers, but at the very least I have renounced my idiotic and evil ways when I became an adult a few months ago. I have reached out to a significant portion of my old enemies (or people that I have wronged in the past) and made amends with them, to which they all forgave me for and moved on. I have yet to apologize to the last few.

I would also like to note that I have deleted any controversial text/comment that I have made online and deleted all of my accounts (for unrelated reasons). I have sent takedown requests to Google and Bing to remove any remaining data of my accounts or personal info from their search engines (which they thankfully did). I do not plan to return to social media ever (unless its absolutely necessary), as I want a peaceful and quiet life away from drama and cancel culture. I do not want anything I say or write to be taken out of context and blown out of proportion like they did with CallMeCarson.

I am not a celebrity by any means, I am currently just an average Joe with a small circle of friends. I want to practice my talents and put myself out there to the world so that my works are recognized by many, but I do not wish to bring fame to myself at all. I prefer to become famous after I die. I am deathly afraid of crediting any of my work to my real name or attaching my face to it (especially online), because it will give clues to my former enemies (the ones that I haven't reconciled with yet) to find me and ruin my reputation (as well as any chances of getting hired for a job).

I know that I am a better person now than the piece of shit I was in the past, my friends and family know this as well. Unfortunately, not everybody knows that I have changed for the better, and some still believe that I am a horrible person who didn't change.

1395,MiataMan7,1613760231,"Ever since middle school ive had anxiety whenever trying too hard. For example I would purposefully not dress well because I thought people would think I'm trying to impress someone and people were judging. I legit stopped wearing basketball jerseys and a lot of other stuff because people said I was just trynna appear athletic. Ironically and rightfully so people still judged me because I was the odd man out dressing badly. The anxiety I face has just prevented me from wearing, listening to certain music (if others can see what I listen to), doing a lot of what I want in the past and carries with me even today. 
Even in the gym- I am quite anxious but not for reasons youd expect. I am already quite fit and can  lift a lot if I want. I could run 20 mph on the treadmill if I so choose But I am always worried that people will think I'm trying to show off or something so I always do less on purpose. Even in academics/competitions I always perform less on purpose so I dont win. It is a weird psychology-its been why ibe been a failure my whole life. Its now become a subconcious process where I decide my actions based on what I feel like everybody else thinks. It is debilitating to my full. potential. Does anybody have anxiety like this where they think people are judging and then this dictates the course of their actions. It feels like for the past 6 years I have been in a mental prison where I'm not really doing anything I feel.

I just wanted to gather some feedback, with each morning I wake up and struggle with my anxiety, the more I realized....I believe a large portion of our Anxiety thoughts and behaviors come from other people. Think about it, we are most anxious when we are at work, we have superiors to answer to, even our friends and family will question us a lot of the times. Not saying to eliminate everyone who brings you anxiety, especially friends and family, the generally have your best interest at heart. However it is a supervisor or manager that brings you anxiety or even someone who is an acquaintance, why not find a way to take those people out of your life, chances are that means changing jobs....and if it has decreased your anxiety wouldn't it have been worth it?

Sorry, just going on a rant here. Just the more I think about the controllable and incontrollable, I realize the controllable tend to reflect upon certain individuals in our life's.

I feel trapped inside my own head. I don’t want to be that person to self diagnose but I am self diagnosed for the simple fact that no one around me cares enough to take me to get help. I know I’m an adult now but I can’t drive yet and such so I have no way of going for myself but I plan on it asap. High school was some of the worst years of my life. The physical, emotional, and mental pain I went through from my anxiety was crazy. I ended up od and was in a hospital for a while. (Just trying to give some context to how I really feel/what I am going through) I am no more suicidal but the anxiety is still very much there, and I don’t know what to do for work. I feel like a bum. Everyone around me thinks I’m just lazy and don’t want to do anything with my life when that’s not the truth at all. I try so hard to get myself to do things I’ve tried 2 different jobs one at a pharmacy and one at a bakery and I had so many panic attacks that I just couldn’t do it. Of course being 19 and living at home I need to work I know that but the people around me really don’t understand how I feel and what I’m going through. They don’t want to understand it either. I tried so badly for years specially in high school to get help from my mom, councilors, teachers, anyone I could and no one seemed to really care. I skipped school for 4 months straight because of how painful it was for me. Sorry I’m just rambling it’s just something that has truly taken over my life and it sucks so badly. Why cant I just work like a normal person? I’m lost. The jobs I do want to do I can’t do right now because they’re just unrealistic, require money to make money or you need previous experience.

On Tuesday morning at about 5 AM my fire alarm went off in my apartment unit because of a low battery situation but I thought there was a real fire in the building so my bf and I quickly packed up our cat and stuff and escaped to my car. Once we saw it was only our unit and there was no real fire we realized we needed to call maintenance to turn off our alarm since we didn't know how to do it ourselves but because the roads were iced over they couldn't come that day. We waited several hours in the car before deciding to seek shelter elsewhere with power. 

Now I don't want to go back to my apartment. The alarm going off and sending me into an adrenaline rush first thing in the morning was something I absolutely hated. I don't like loud noises or alarms and this alarm was going off SUPER loudly in every room in my unit. I don't know what to do, I can't just not stay in the apartment I rent but I'm so scared the alarm will go off again. Any advice would be welcomed. Thanks!

The physical symptoms appeared - chest pounding and tightening, dizziness that would last for weeks, feeling like I was going to pass out, bouts of insomnia. I ended up in the ER more times than I could count. Before having my daughter, I’ve never been in a hospital. I don’t know why motherhood did this to me. 

When I go through these periods of physical pains and symptoms, I am so sure I am dying of a disease or have something that will alter my life. Then these physical symptoms go away and my life is back to normal. I think about how grateful I am to not be in that miserable state anymore. Months pass, then boom, randomly physical symptoms start appearing again, but these are new physical symptoms. And it’s down that dark rabbit hole of despair again. 

Here I am, my hands and feet tingle, feeling sore - for no reason. I google to see if these symptoms are associated with anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this before? I’m embarrassed to see my primary doctor yet again for something else. He’s patient with me, but he is human. I’m sure he’s judging.

I mean I deserve it I forgot to take that stupid shit out but my goodness I can't stop thinking about it. 

I'm beyond mortified. My boss has been in 'busy' since it happened and I can't call and get it off my chest and apologize. 

So I'm just sitting here rotting with it and being like ""hm i wonder if this is the one that costs me my job"" (I complained about software before in a team meeting and was told my comments were too negative after the fact)

My job is too stressful for my levels of anxiety (but i mean i need it so lol eff me i guess)

I had a panic attack last night for no reason so this isn't how I needed to kick Friday off. 

I guess I'll just keep staring at this red 'busy' dot until it turns green and i can call the boss and grovel. i hope they are understanding and accepting of my apology.",Anxiety,I just got in trouble at work,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lnjzxr/i_just_got_in_trouble_at_work/,1613723437.0

So not that this is important but I have generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, mild OCD, and I haven’t been diagnosed with social anxiety but I do feel like I am developing some form of social anxiety. So bad I can’t even talk to my closest friends without freaking out afterwards or thinking way too much about anything such as my actions or my words during any conversation. I live with my best friend and he smokes a lot of weed. So much he’ll get so high and kinda just sit there and it’s hard for me to differentiate just him “being high” or if I’m making him uncomfortable all the time. It really really bothers me and makes it hard for me to do anything or say anything because I feel like he’s always just staring at me waiting for me to do something when really I’m just doing my own thing and I’m fine with that. I just hate it when people expect me to talk more or have something to say first thing when I wake up or every time I see them. I’m very introverted and I will admit that sometimes I do come off as extroverted. I feel like that’s some kind of coping mechanism when it comes to awkwardness. I honestly don’t wanna be bothered most of the time but I feel like he expects so much from me and it really brings me down. Gives me the worst anxiety. Like is he being quiet because what I said was weird? Should I not say anything at all next time? Every question runs through my mind like what am I doing wrong??? It doesn’t help that he does make me feel weird if I don’t respond the way he was expecting me to (so I think) or if we don’t agree on something. I just hate having this kind of anxiety. I wish he could be more understanding about these things and why I’m so awkward most of the time because I feel like I’m just so weird. He’s known me for over a decade now. I don’t get it.

1431,005chri,1613750948,"A huge part of the way I coped with what’s happening to me was escaping it entirely whether that be subconsciously or just choosing to escape the cause that is still happening to me. I usually did this by distracting myself or ridding myself from the unnecesarily bad things that happen to me on a daily basis by using my laptop to consume entertainment by films/shows or knowledge of things to keep myself in check from everything. It usually did work but a month or two ago, my laptop broke because I spilled water on the keyboard so now it’s in a computer repair shop but it’s taking so long in there that I developed a new way to cope after being in a really low state for some time.

Unfortunately, this new way of coping feels incomplete. The way I coped back then was not that sustainable but it has a greater sense of reliability to it and I was still paying attention to my physical health. This time around, I haven’t been focused on things. I have a lot of incomplete school work, I haven’t brushed my teeth in a couple of days (or weeks), only brushing and bathing when I feel some sort of productivity. 


I only did things that might alleviate the anxiety that I feel on a daily basis like doing chores so my abusers (family) just leave me alone because whenever they interact with me, they’re just awful that they make me really anxious all the time with their unnecessary crap. After doing those, I try to relax and just try to distract myself or get rid of their existence in my head to get back to feeling healthy. I always tell myself that I’ll do my school work at this time but I procrastinate because I usually feel really awful when that time comes. 

I missed over 4-6 weeks of school. A new semester just started and I haven’t done school. Part of the reason why I don’t do it is becaus I think it’s just pointless. My teachers, subjects, lessons and classmates are pretty unnecessary not to me but uneceessary like my abusive family. Whenever I do school work, I always seem to feel diminished because I feel like I’ve advanced to greater things than what they’re currently at that it just seems like a hindrance to me.

I see and understand the value of physical health but I just can’t seem to work on it like how I work on my mental health because unlike physical health, it’s more complicated. I’m not using my anxiety as an excuse but I’m using it as an explanation as to why I can’t attend to my physical needs.

With all of these combined, it makes me more anxious which affects my mental health which then affects my physical health which then makes me more anxious etc.",Anxiety,My physical health is being awfully affected by my poor mental health atm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lnjh28/my_physical_health_is_being_awfully_affected_by/,1613722148.0
1432,GlitteringChemical13,1613750142,"I have been thinking about this since last night, should I post something? will people get it, or reply, or comment? Then I realized, who gives a fuck. Someone will read it, even if they don't like it. I have no community and no fucking friends, and I want to change that. I'm in search of community and people who'll understand or at least, not someone who gets me to try to feel better by telling me about their life with no mental illness or experience or knowledge of it. This is the first time I'm typing anything about my mental illness. Fuck it. 
I'm a 23 year old female who has the worst anxiety, I think, in the world. LOL. I know I don't, but it feels so terribly crushing. I have been suffering from anxiety since I can remember, I just have never been diagnosed or Ive never really spoken about it. A little back story, all my life I never shown emotions, hat was considered weak or not allowed. When I tried to, it was always unnecessary and too much. So I started compartmentalizing since I was like 11. But fuck now that I think of it, that 11 year old already had so much trauma, my family sold drugs out the one bedroom apartment we lived in, in the Bronx. 10 people in one apartment..... All to still end up in poverty. I was abused by my aunts boyfriend as a kid. He was in love with my mom and compared me to her, he groomed me and made me feel important. I've never had a father figure, so it was just so confusing to me. MY mom and aunt had so many fights about this man growing up and no one knew until I had a mental breakdown a few weeks ago and told my mom. She hasn't brought it up or said anything about it. Ok, I guess? I'm still confused mom. My childhood is truly one of a kind and I hope that one day I can write a book about it. The story itself is inspirational. How the fuck am I ok? I'm NOT and it's time to be honest about it. I just don't want to do it in a meek way. This shit is all over the place, OK! fast forward..... 2019! Ive always experienced anxiety but just never knew. I started smoking cigarettes when I was just 14. I drank coffee at least 3 times a day and I couldn't live without that shit. In 2019 I moved back to the Bronx and decided to pursue my post-secondary education because I needed a real fucking job. I had my son in 2018 and his father and I just didn't work. So I moved on and went to school. I left my son in another state with my mom while I went to school. HOLY FUCK ANXIETY. I was constantly thinking about tomorrow and everything I did was simply not good enough for me. I had some support from friends back in HS, but all these people did was drink and talk shit. I am eternally grateful for the shit they gave me in advice cause sometimes, I really did need that shit. No matter how shitty it was. I went to school and held it down daily. I got up every morning, took a bus to a train and did the damn thing. The anxiety was mild, palpitations, only excessive thoughts, mostly fear of failing. I slept through the night. I was productive and decent.  
Ending in 2019 I met this guy, let's call him smith. He was 24 in the arts and had these eyes I fell in love with. We met at a friend's birthday. He went out to smoke a cigarette and at the time I really didn't have any, ( I was broke) I went outside and shot my shot. Bitch let me tell you, I landed, and I wish I never did.  
We hung out a few weeks after that and we were just inseparable. We couldn't get enough of each other. We finished each other's sentences and shit. But there was a mother fucking problem. This dick head had anger issues. He didn't know how to control his tone and the shit he said. At the beginning it was kind of exciting like oooooo this guy is going to put my wild ass in my place... But then it was yelling and screaming furiously in my face about the shit I couldn't do. How I couldn't communicate and how useless I practically was. I slept on the floor of this assholes grandmothers house for like a fucking month. Why bitch? I Didn't have anyone, I had a place to live and was working 3 jobs at the time, but I just didn't have love. I didn't have (good) company. I didn't have my baby boy. And I was so fucking vulnerable and clueless. We ended up moving somewhere else and living together, even though when I came to visit my son ( monthly) he cheated multiple times and his dumb ass got caught.... I stayed. I promise I knew I didn't want to be there, I knew it wasn't right for me. But I stayed, cause in the beginning of 2020 covid hit and guess who got stuck? me, Ya girl. OR SO I THOUGHT, you see....my anxiety got so bad I thought I needed him. I THOUGHT I NEEDED THIS ASSHOLE JUST CAUSE HE WAS NICE TO ME 2/10 TIMES AND I DIDNT GET THAT SHIT ANYWHERE ELSE. BITCH, where is yo self-love? HOE, I didn't even know what that was until later on. We were always so back and forth, I was always sad cause I didn't want to be there, and I missed the fuck out of my son, and I really didn't have his support. He just fucked me and cuddled me and shit and he was a close friend. AND HE DIDNT EVEN SATISFY ME SEXUALLY. You would think, at the very least he would. But nah.  
OK Ya'll this post is still about my mental health... So 4 months later, still with this dick, the abuse is constant. I have my first panic attack ever. Everything was scary, the feeling in your chest during a panic attack and brain and extremities just something inexplicable. I couldn't breathe, I thought someone was going to see me and for some reason kidnap me while crying and hurt me even more. OK WTF. But the thoughts are insane, everything triggers fear and panic. He sat with me and got me through my first panic attack. That was the first and last one he witnessed. I'm like yo, I'm mad talented (even though idk wtf to do with my life yet, or what my passion is), I'm so beautiful, why the fuck should I stand for this.... So mid 2020 I got my diploma. But not physically because covid. I felt it was finally time to up and leave back to my baby and I wanted to so bad... Consciously didn't know how to. I started a small argument that later turned into a police report and all sorts of extra shit. The next day I came back to my baby and mom. But what happened? I didn't speak to anyone about absolutely anything and I was dealing with all the shit alone again. But more now, cause how the fuck am I supposed to be alone? AND deal with shit.

Hey guys, I need to rant and need advice if anyone can give, so yeah. I'm a 15 year old and I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but I was officially diagnosed with it a year and a half ago. I have been in therapy since and really hasn't done much for me. I have stayed relatively stagnant mental health wise since then, but recently I have begun to spiral. It really started this summer when I started having panic attacks. I hadn't really had this issue, but suddenly I started getting them maybe once every week or two. Since then, it has progressed to having panic attacks three or more times a week. I don't know what triggers them, but I just get really scared and overwhelmed for no reason. First question: **Do you guys know of any ways to find out if there is something that triggers my panic attacks?**

Since the summer, a bunch of other things have progressed, for example, I probably get substantially drunk up to three times a week, which probably isn't helping anything, on top of that I've also developed what I think is an eating disorder or at least disordered eating, and have thought about hurting myself a bunch of times. I think all of these changes have led to an increase in anxiety, which has made my life extremely hard. I have lost virtually all motivation for school and have failed numerous tests, my mom is completely at a loss, and is very disappointed in me. I get panic attacks now during tests, something that never happened before, and I am afraid I'm going to fail my classes. This is where my other questions come in:

**How can I get past my anxiety to actually get out of bed and do my work?**

**Is there any way to make my mom understand why I'm failing?**

Finally, this part is geared especially to people in therapy, or to people who have gone through therapy in the past. I have withheld a bunch of info from my therapist, because I'm am afraid she will think I'm making everything up, as well as the fact that I'm afraid about how she will react. **How do I tell my therapist what I'm feeling?** In the past, I've only really brushed aside the topic of what I think is my ED and basically all of my panic attacks. I'm sure this is why therapy isn't working, but I'm afraid of what is going to happen if I tell her about it. I want to get better but I don't know how.

 I was professionally diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 12 my Mum and Dad are very aware about it although my dad can't seem to remember me being in therapy for 6 months. Nothing much came of it (camhs wasn't helpful) but over the years I've managed to work on myself small things like being able to order food, go out in public and laugh, and even wear t-shirts without the worry of people laughing at my arms. Lockdown threw all of it to shit, just as I started to become more free and fun I was put in lockdown for atleast a year. My anxiety went back up, not interacting with people meant I now was detached from socialisation and didn't know how to handle it. 
 Recently I've had more issues, being 17 means doctor calls are directed towards me and college means I'm having to interact from home. I can handle face to face if it comes to it but phone calls freak me out, mabye it's the fact I can't see their face to judge weather or not their annoyed idk.
 This morning my mum was saying their letting seniors come back to do work in school, I told them I'm fine on my own but they never drop it until I cave or loose my shit and walk away. As my mum was leaving I was slumped by my desk I'm tired and honestly considering just running as far as I fucking can. When she came in her first words were
 ""mabye consider keeping an eye on you facial expressions, your glaring at me""
 I wasn't I was just tired but now I worry I've got resting bitch face. She proceeded to tell me she wants me to phone the school if I don't want to go, I dont know if they do this on purpose they know I've always freaked out around phone calls and that threat used to make me just do what they wanted (plus that kinda stuff needs you to be 18) and then she tells me to phone my college (I was put into a course that was only taught online and I wanted to actually connect with others my age so I was looking into my other choice which would allow me to socialise and improve, problem was I sent them an email and they never got back after a few days so my mum wants me to push for it.) When I eventually just gave up and explained to her that I CANT phone atm because I'd freak out she just laughed and said 
 "" you need to get over it, that's life""
 This is their awnser every fucking time I try and explain. I'm tired I don't want to be here and have to deal with it.

The first semester wasn't too bad. The schedule was well organised and i had free time for other activities outside uni. I would say it was pretty manageable especially for a computer engineering major.

Recently i received the schedule for the second semester. When I saw it I literally got dizzy and didn't feel good, i had to lay down for a bit (I'm not even  exaggerating lol). This schedule is so disorganised, i have lessons from early in the morning till 8pm! And there's like only one gap in between half of the day before continuing with the, what i would like to call, evening session. My anxiety is through the roof now. I don't know how I'll be able to do this. After classes i have to study and repeat the material, do extra exercises for improving my knowledge and when will I be able to do these stuff when the whole days are filled with classes?

1442,exosgomez,1613745708,"I get really bad anxiety when I lose things even small things like lip balm because I usually am good with keeping my stuff safe but lately my memory has gotten worse so I’m not as aware.

I lost my wallet yesterday at a petrol station and it had all of my important cards in there; bank card, driving licence, work ID and some gift cards.

I didn’t realise I lost it till I got notifications on my phone that money is being taken out from different stores and realised what had happened.

I did cancel my cards and got the money back from the bank luckily but I still feel really stupid for losing it when it’s so important. I also called the police but I know they can’t do much.

I went back to the petrol station and they showed me some cctv but the guy had a mask and hoodie on and was walking, instead of taking his car, so it’s impossible to track him.

I don’t know if he just used my card and did something with the wallet or took the whole thing as my friends were saying he might’ve thrown the wallet and just took the card but I looked around and couldn’t see it, but I just wish I could get it back.

But I’ve managed to replace almost all the items in there, I’ve ordered a new card and licence and had some spare gift cards at home and got a new work ID. But I just still feel sad because it was a really nice wallet too.

I’m grateful it was replaceable and it was only my wallet as it could’ve been worse but I still can’t shake this feeling. 

I just wish he would’ve handed it in, he spent about £50 on alcohol and cigarettes from 4 different stores, but none on the staff at the stores could recognise his face enough to help me and even if they could it’s not like I could track the guy. 

My only hope is that now that my card is useless he will just send me the wallet back as my licence has my address, or if he did throw it away, someone else would send it to me. I know it’s unlikely but I’m having a really difficult time getting over this as I don’t take losing things very well and it causes me so much stress to the point I can’t eat or sleep because I replay that moment too much.

TL:DR I lost my wallet and some guy stole it and now I can probably never get it back.

This time a couple of years ago i'd just finished university where I'd dealt with addiction, depression, and agoraphobia. I moved back to my parents in debt, jobless, on benefits and wouldn't leave my room. I ate to feel better and got bigger and felt suicidal. 

Fast forward to now and I've lost 6 stone, have a job, and have moved out. Everything has gotten better, but there are still things that I get extremely anxious about. I'm still socially awkward in some situations, and one of those situations is at my shared house. My housemates all have ways that they annoy me, so I don't really go into the kitchen or living room unless I need to. I do most things in my room, which I'm perfectly happy with. It's a big room, I have a desk and an armchair and a TV.

The issue is I'm super anxious when watching the TV or listening to music. I keep it on a low volume and have subtitles on. When the volume gets louder I quieten it, so I have my remote in my hand constantly. I also listen out for housemates coming up or down the stairs and turn it down then as well. It's just normal shows that I watch, absolutely nothing to be awkward about. I still can't help feeling this way. Does anybody else do this or similar things? Like at work or on public transport I'll only have one earphone in because I want to be able to hear what's going on around me. I feel like I can never truly relax, always on high alert.

1452,Early_Power_5366,1613739701,"Is it normal to have suicidal thoughts in one's life ???

I say yes it definitely is. As a person who grew up with American television they never really talked about the hardships in life. It didn't project the human soul or Body, Mind and Spirit properly in my opinion, unless you watch certain shows that definitely explain that very same topic like Roseanne, avatar The Last Airbender, bojack horseman and even certain episodes to your favorite sitcoms and shows. Well, the reason why I'm mentioning television is because we never truly realize what happens to us until we actually experience the most impactful events in our lives. The human mind is a very complex thing where it has its own way in processing things. 

 Suicidal thoughts ""in my opinion"" is your brains  defense mechanism . It's the quickest thought process to ending suffering and it's based off of your own defition on what that suffering is.  ""I want to stop feeling like this as soon as possible no matter what I experience."" which is all good words to me because it's saying you are willing to self improve ""hopefully"" and if you're not then there's the other way of thinking which is ""I'm inpatient, I have no self-control and I do not want to self improve , I want my misery to end now. "" 

No suicide in general to me is like running backwards to cross the finish line that we are all going to eventually cross . No matter how messed up you think you are I'm telling you right now you are not alone. When I first experience intrusive thoughts it literally scared the hell out of me and I'm glad it did because it's saying that I didn't want to die or hurt anyone.

  I feel like the people who want to be happy everyday are the most selfish ones out there. Because every emotion from bad to good is always temporary, it can last with you for God knows how long but it's still temporary whether you think it or not. The most naive people such as myself. That happiness was the key to living a good life. There's no balance and just being one thing or the other being sad all the time is going to make you suffer and being happy all the time is going to make you suffer eventually. We often believe this is a proper way of Enlightenment but it isnt... you need to take on your harsh realities with a positive to neutral Outlook in the road to Enlightenment. To reach Enlightenment it's to reach the hard ships one's life has endured and to expect reality as what it is and one's self. Suicidal Thoughts is just another obstacle that is meant for you to improve, not to live in fear and negativity. No matter how messed up you think you are, failure and success is inevitable. Doing nothing in your life is the worst thing you can do for yourself and suicide is a way of nothingness ....but with suicidal thoughts there's always an option for you and I hope all of you choose the right one.

1455,PPhriends,1613736728,"Today I got a phone call from a bakery at around 6:15 pm. The lady on the phone asked politely if I was me, I calmly replied with “yes can I help you”? She then asked if I was on the way to come pick up a cake I had ordered this past week scheduled for 5:30 (They close at 6). I lied very frantically because I had totally forgotten about this small thing due to a busier work week than usual. I said I would be there in 10 min knowing damn well I live at minimum 15-20 away with all lights green.
My wife and I got into the car very fast and headed over there, hitting every red light (of course) which ended up taking about 30 min. They were closed. No one there waiting or sign of life. 

Seeing them closed made me feel like I never ever have before. I couldn’t stop thinking about how mad the girl who probably waited around for me a little extra would be. This feeling of guilt mixed with her being mad mixed with me being sad I guess for lying about something so dumb just hit me HARD. 
I started crying and felt like I was choking. Gasping for air and feeling like I couldn’t control my body, mind or emotions. 
I like to think of myself as someone who is fairly put together as well as someone who really doesn’t care about much. I had never cried for much really including brake-ups or family deaths.

My story:
I have always been an over-thinker my whole life partly due to my ADHD. I am someone who needs to find answers and loves to be challenged mentally. However my anxiety is mainly provoked when I begin to think of things that have no definite answers such as the meaning of life and human existence and other existential thoughts. However it hasn’t been very prominent until recently when I had my first severe panic attack, keep in mind prior to the attack I had no knowledge on the subject I didn’t know the symptoms or the severity of what happens psychologically. I was naive and thought panic attacks were just feeling of discomfort and that people just bounced back like normal after them, but clearly I was very wrong. While the attack was happening I thought I was on the verge of losing control and going insane I was vomiting and experiencing derealization and thought that life was a dream and that it was fake along with irrational thoughts of suicide. Luckily my sister was home and was able to help me during that time. Days following the panic attack I was still experiencing derealization and depersonalization along with muscle aches and uncontrollable shaking. I felt like I lost the ability to think rationally for that period of time and I couldn’t stop googling my symptoms trying to fix myself and it made my situation even worse because when you google your symptoms they tell you that you are practically dead. However as days passed by and I was healing and started to slowly make progress I still noticed anxiety played a large role in my daily life and still does today. Since that time I haven’t had a serious panic attack, I’ve only had minor ones that usually take about 2 days for me to get back on my feet at 100%. 

Anyways I am eternally grateful for these experiences because they were eye openers for me to see into the seriousness of mental illness and how it can be frustrating and annoying at times and how it can impair your daily life and really forces you to work on yourself. In addition to this I have learned that by talking to my peers some aspects of mental illness are almost impossible to explain because it is something that someone must experience to understand the full depth of it, and that’s frustrating for me. I feel like many aspects of mental health are brushed off because of this, especially during teenage years when change is always happening. By changing my perspective and seeing positives coming out of these experiences they have helped me heal and feel better. I still definitely advise seeking medical attention whether it’s medication therapy or some other form of help as long as it is helping your quality of life in a healthy way. Also I advise finding a hobby I have found a passion in fitness, cooking and nutrition which keeps my mind busy especially during all the free time I have with the pandemic.

1481,PhrygianNoodles,1613728068,"I am a 21 year old guy with depression and anxiety that probably started 9 years ago. In middle school I became obsessed with politics, religion, and conspiracy theories. I went from being the popular kid to the crazy kid and alienated most of my friends. I would preach about christianity, warn people about the illuminati, and go online to argue about conspiracy theories with random people. I started feeling like I was special, like I was the chosen one or something. This feeling carried with me through highschool, but it made me very depressed and anxious even still. I turned to drugs out of sheer lack of care for my own wellbeing and was addicted to both opiates and benzos by age 15. I got in a lot of trouble in school, let my grades fall and really took a number on my body, I was also very fat. I then experimented with psychedelics in high doses which helped me to quit the hard drugs, and inspired me to lose 100 lbs, but I'm still overweight. 

Now as a young adult I've been struggling to get through community college, I take classes some semesters and some I don't because I tend to do good right up until the end and then get anxious depressed episodes that last about a month. I will fail, going from an A to a D and not doing my finals. I'll stare at a computer screen for hours unable to type anything and just thinking about how much of a failure I am. I hate having to tell everyone I know that I am not doing well in school and hearing their lectures because they think it's pure laziness, and while surely I am lazy, I swear I just get these crazy overthinking binges and am incapable of producing anything. 

At work I'm a ball of unstable energy. I run around manically and repeat myself over and over. I'm fast at making the food but I make a lot of mistakes and get angrier and angrier at myself. I have been working with many of the same people for 2 years now and I still am anxious around them though. I still feel stressed having to talk to them, I stressed answering phone orders, talking to customers. Even though I do it over and over again 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. I usually understand my emotions, but I don't understand the anxiety. Sometimes I forget I'm anxious until I look down and my hands are shaking and my heart is racing and I feel completely exhausted. 

Now for the worst, I feel anxious accomplishing simple everyday tasks. I've always been a bit shy I guess but being seen in public makes me chronically hate myself. I just think about how I'm like 25 lbs overweight and how girls must find me disgusting and when I see anyone who looks healthy I just get so sad and disappointed with myself. I've tried to lose weight for so long. I'm constantly attempting to be healthier but I fall off and binge eat, binge drink, and will lay in bed when I get off of work sometimes. Just dealing with those periodic depressive episodes I was talking about. They reset my progress or even worse sometimes put me further back. I really do not like myself at all. I find myself to be another fat loser virgin who thought he was smart enough to get by but failed and just became another casualty of poor self discipline. And that's another thing, Women make me the most anxious of all. No exaggeration, I can't talk to them. I have plenty of females in my family and I can talk to them of course, but any potential partner it's a no go. I can't look them in the eye to save my life. I can't think straight when they talk to me, and I can't help but feel like the kind of disgusting pos's they must laugh at in their spare time. 

Sometimes the anxiety goes the step further to panic. I hate panic attacks so damn much. They make the paranoia factor come into play. I may be thinking about aliens, or my health, or my future, and I will work myself into what feels like a heart attack and siezure all at once. My vision will change to a red hue, my heart thumps with severe tachycardia, my brain races, my hands go numb, and I will even hallucinate psychedelic fractals, usually made out of dead body parts, strange forest animals, or sacred symbols. It's so embarrassing to be with friends and just sit there crying and shaking because the residual effects wont go away. I always step out of the room when the attack starts and I hide because I don't want to say anything that freaks people out. Sometimes they make me feel like I'm being plotted against and that my death is imminent. 

A lot of the time I think I just fried myself ond drugs after an already pretty unhealthy childhood. The xanax probably ruined my central nervous system and then blasting off with psychedelics just opened some bad connections. That coupled with being the crazy conspiracy kid, makes me grateful I'm not staring down a dumpster on the side of an urban street. I feel like a tweaker sometimes, most people don't understand a lot of what I say and I have to dumb it down. Though I get paranoid that I'm just speaking disorganized and developing schizophrenia.

1483,runmymind,1613727447,"Like the title says, how do you just “live in the moment”? I often find my mind drifting off to places where I don’t really want them to be because I basically live in my mind and I end up in an off-mood. I’m currently meditating to help ease my mind and I’m trying to journal when my mind really needs it. My anxiety kind of just gets messy even when I’m not doing anything. It kind of has to do with how I only isolate myself in my room and how I don’t really talk to anyone, not that I can do much about that (and even w/o the pandemic I usually preferred it like this, but it’s getting a bit much now w/ quarantining) and it makes my mind drift back into being anxious over nothing and everything. I think I just need to be patient with everything I’m trying to do to help it as best as I can, but I’m curious what else anyone does to cope or help with this :’) 

Also, another thing I wanted to add with the whole social thing, whenever I do end up talking to someone just once, I end up in a spiral of overthinking again, but not being able to talk to anyone is kind of making my anxiety skyrocket in the first place and it’s a whole vicious cycle of not wanting to talk to anyone again.

1485,eyeofthelunar,1613726335,"I’m currently a senior in college and have been living with anxiety disorder for the last five or six years. Certain social situations are really triggering to me, and attending class in general leaves me in a state of panic for pretty much the entire time. Over Christmas break, I attended therapy and pushed my boundaries with social interactions, and I actually felt ready to return for my spring semester. That is, until I got partnered up with an “ex”, really, someone who I used to sleep with, in class. It’s a very interactive lab class, and I’m not quite the best at that particular subject. 

It’s been a few years since we’ve talked, we are both now in long term relationships, and things are civil. However, there is a lingering tension and extreme awkwardness being around each other. 

I don’t know. It’s just throwing me off. We’ve only had one class so far, and it was just incredibly distracting to me. I already managed to mess up and embarrass myself, and I can’t imagine it’ll be the last time as I mentioned it’s a weak subject for me, and paired with the distraction of the awkwardness - it’s just disastrous. 

The class is only once a week for a few hours, and I’ve been comforting myself with the fact that after this semester, I will never see him again. It really isn’t the end of the world if I mess up in front of him. Why should I care? I’m certain he won’t go about the rest of his week fixated on the mistakes I made in class. It’s like I convince myself that everyone is always focused on me, always talking about me, always judging me, when really, I’m probably the most minuscule part of this guys life. 

I guess I’m just looking for some comfort on this situation. Anxiety makes the silliest things feel like the end of the world. I’m seriously dreading our next class and having to work so closely with him. I’ve already asked to switch partners, but my professor is kind of an ass and didn’t agree.

Hello,

So I'm having a case where I moved to a new place for a new job pursuing better career opportunities and I got some inner values conflict, that starts with...

\- too low salary (but I'm entry-level 2nd month yet), high working hours (startup) &amp; screen time

\- Distrust in myself. (career-wise I'm not sure how many years I have to dedicated to becoming a manager to get paid. + I feeling pressured at work to deliver doesn't help)

\- relationship with GF (there's sometimes doubts so we conflict)

\- household sharing with unknown people and life in a new place in general

\- friends and family that want attention (I don't get pressure), but still I get offers and calls (that costs time), and working long hours and having bad time managing skills requires to cut that attention. It's sad.

\- some BIG rumination on my insecurities, being pity about myself, having unhealthy ego battles about comparing to other people, and more...

Like, you get it there's a lot of going on my mind. IT'S ALWAYS ARE.

I'm not even sure what could be a dealbreaker here.

Even now I'm writing before work because I was snapped out of a dream and reflected 2 hours. 6hours of sleep instead of 8.30 will definitely affect my performance. BUT I wouldn't have time (due to work, travel &amp; household) to share if It wasn't for this.

SO despite my work performance will go down. THERE's a good thing - that reflection on a dream symbolism gave me some guidelines on the relationship puzzle to solve. And this reflection gives me some confidence that I'm: getting answers, know what I'm doing, have control in my life. When I'm not doing that and only working I feel down and I still procrastinate work and think about some of my life aspects that I'm worried about.

The thing is WHEN I focus on my feelings, inner reflection, and build the whole life picture I LOSE energy that is time and that affects my work results. When it affects my results I'm being pressured and micromanaged more. AND this is a natural consequence as I'm getting paid to deliver and concentrate on work as it's said ""It's not personal, it's just business"" so no feelings in work.

This whole situation is a big deal for me and its deal to live with it, somehow it's too damn hard.

Hey people

I am a 23 YO M. Im pretty sure that I suffer from anxiety and I experience depressive symptoms sometimes.

most of the times I am down.

I left my home country 2 years ago and i would say my personality changed a lot.
 i dont have the energy to even make friends.

 i dont even want to and this is unlike me.

 i hate sitting in coffee shops or going to clubs i feel its useless and its killing my IQ. - sorry if i sound so full of myself but im just trying to be honest. 

nothing surpises me anymore and nothing impresses me... im in my last semester of my Masters degree and I cant find a job which even makes it harder especially since the past 3 years have been really difficult on literally every aspect. 

all of this makes me contemplate quitting life and going back to my hometown which is in the mountains of a small developing country. - sounds attractive it is but I hate living there because people over there are somehow ignorant and closed minded. 


lately my mom who has been extremely supportive advised me on taking omega 3 supplements because i used to take it as a kid and since i never ate fish and I am not getting the necessary nutrients.

anyways after a while of having omega 3 supplements, i felt much better but i still suffer from anxiety and some depression symptoms. 

I don't have the energy to get out bed sometimes. 

I never smoked/drank because i used to value life so much and i wanted to live a healthy one so i used to care about my diet a lot. 

lately I've been even thinking of starting smoking which btw I never saw  as ""cool"" but as something that kills humans slowly - hence why i want it now. 

and the thing is that im always stressed out and I am in a stage where I feel like anxiety is a part of me and its a part I cant live without and i dont want to even get better. 
I want to be sad I want to be stressed but at the same time I want to be happy. im not sure if it makes sense. 

something which makes me feel sad is that everyone around me is successful. im very happy for them but I do wonder where i went wrong.

my siblings and friends went to top unis, and have got jobs. amazing jobs. 
my father built himself a fortune after being a minimum wage worker which btw puts extra pressure on me to outperform him. 

he keeps telling me that everything He owns is mine but that even sucks more because I dont want a penny from him because i don't deserve them. I keep telling him that and he refuses to acknowledge. 

 he always feels obligated to give me money, i never spend them on anything.
if u see me ull never guess that my parents are somehow well of in life.

i live in a basement with a roomate, i have a 300$ phone,  and the last time i went shopping was 3 years ago. 

last summer i wore sweat shorts for 3 months.
and 
my only entertainment was that i went out to bike and got an escort twice, it was something i needed - don't judge please. 

 in addition what even kills my brain is that every stock/crypro I thought about of buying and even shortlisted on a paper to buy did extremely well the past year. 

i feel if i had the balls i would have made 1M$+ in the stockmarket/crypto currencies which i bet on. i almost bought them but i did not have the guts to do it. thats who I am, i never take the risks I should. 

in regards to a serious relationship, I dont even want a GF even though i see plenty of hot girls and most of them are my neighbors.. . very hot ladies but i dont want a relationship... i never talk to them. 
i dont even have the energy to approach them.

i also dont want to hurt them later on because i know im not capable of giving anything in a relationship. 

this is what i basically think of everyday. stress, anxiety, the thought that i could have made over a million dollars had i had guts, and the fact that im wasting my best years to be a single loser who is probably living with his parents in his 30/40s.

im wasting my looks, which im losing day by day.

Hey guys, I need to rant and need advice if anyone can give, so yeah. I'm a 15 year old and I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but I was officially diagnosed with it a year and a half ago. I have been in therapy since and really hasn't done much for me. I have stayed relatively stagnant mental health wise since then, but recently I have begun to spiral. It really started this summer when I started having panic attacks. I hadn't really had this issue, but suddenly I started getting them maybe once every week or two. Since then, it has progressed to having panic attacks three or more times a week. I don't know what triggers them, but I just get really scared and overwhelmed for no reason. First question: **Do you guys know of any ways to find out if there is something that triggers my panic attacks?** 

Since the summer, a bunch of other things have progressed, for example, I probably get substantially drunk up to three times a week, which probably isn't helping anything, on top of that I've also developed what I think is an eating disorder or at least disordered eating, and have thought about hurting myself a bunch of times. I think all of these changes have led to an increase in anxiety, which has made my life extremely hard. I have lost virtually all motivation for school and have failed numerous tests, my mom is completely at a loss, and is very disappointed in me. I get panic attacks now during tests, something that never happened before, and I am afraid I'm going to fail my classes. This is where my other questions come in: 

**How can I get past my anxiety to actually get out of bed and do my work?**

**Is there any way to make my mom understand why I'm failing?**

Finally, this part is geared especially to people in therapy, or to people who have gone through therapy in the past. I have withheld a bunch of info from my therapist, because I'm am afraid she will think I'm making everything up, as well as the fact that I'm afraid about how she will react. **How do I tell my therapist what I'm feeling?** In the past, I've only really brushed aside the topic of what I think is my ED and basically all of my panic attacks. I'm sure this is why therapy isn't working, but I'm afraid of what is going to happen if I tell her about it. I want to get better but I don't know how.

For the last 2 years, I’ve been receiving a high level of care from my university's hospital mental health professionals, and all that’s coming to an end so suddenly. To be honest, at the beginning of quarantine last year I was not in a good place (I was in a pretty bad place for god knows how long) and I had stopped seeing my therapist for 2 months at the start of everything. She would call me, but I didn’t engage much. I did end up starting therapy with her again and although I’m still not in a good place I feel like after 2 years I finally began to open up. Anyways, since my therapist and other mental health services are through my school's hospital, it means that I will no longer be able to receive their services once I graduate. I wasn’t expecting to have to find a new therapist until September of this year but my journey with college is coming to an end in just 4 weeks because that’s when I finish school and I will no longer be able to receive therapy from my therapist or see a psychiatrist. 

This is really getting to me because I really do feel like I finally have a support system. Just at the start of quarantine last year I also lost all my friends, like all of them. Obviously, my mental health had a lot to do with it.  And being home has been extremely hard because not to go into too much, my home is very broken and I’m back in an emotionally abusive place. So I have no one to open up to and that’s hard especially when you struggle with SI and feeling like you’re this worthless invisible person.

1522,Kaeriil,1613713180,"TLDR; I had some sort of “something” over knowing that I was late and that I would have to call someone to open the door to get into work and explain why I was late. I felt frozen and I felt like I didn’t want anything to be done and that everything was out of my control. Is that a panic attack or something else? 

I woke up at 3:45am, a little late since I needed to be at work at 4:00am. I got almost 2 hours of sleep, as I’ve been having trouble sleeping. And when I woke up I felt really bad and tired. I went to put on clothes and forgot to dry them, so I got angry that I was wearing wet clothes. It has been snowing all night and the roads were really bad and at 4am it’s still very dark out. 

At this point I’m already late for work as I get in the car. I realize I washed my face mask too and I didn’t have it with me. I scream and just start crying. Thinking about it now makes me really sad. My mom drives me to work since I don’t have a drivers license (I’m very anxious about driving, got my learners permit a long time ago but it expired. Recently got it again though) so she was trying to comfort me as I’m scream-crying. 

She gets my mask and continues to drive me very very slowly to work since the roads are very slippery/snowy, it’s very dark and sorta of hard to see because of the falling snow, and we can’t see the lanes in the road. As I’m becoming more and more late I just keep crying and being hysterical. 

I had an intense fear of dread. And I just felt lost and out of control. I just wanted to ball up and hide from the world forever. I also kinda wanted to get out of the car and run into the snow and die. I don’t know why I had these intense emotions over being late. I have social anxiety so the thought of talking to someone on why I was late just overwhelmed me. 

I’m just wondering if this is a panic attack? Or just something else? I will ask my therapist when I see her next, but I don’t know what to describe this as.

Had a really bad week. It got better. Then I went back into it.

Lately, before I’m about to fall asleep (sometimes even when i still have the light on tho) i get auditory hallucinations. And i don’t mean ongoing stuff like having a conversation with someone, i just mean very disrupting flashes of noise, usually snippets from the day. Like a rush of one of my friends talking, or a yell i might have heard at the pool that i guard at.  This is then usually followed by almost like a google auto-fill thing where i imagine one of my friends saying something, and then they start saying stuff like “i hate you” or “you’re worthless to me.” Most disturbingly, 

*TRIGGER WARNING* this is really creepy

recently i imagined being in the car with one of my friend and his face contorting into a creepy smile and then him leaning over and starting to eat me and bite me. 

Now i know how this sounds. I’m going crazy. And yes, the thoughts do force themselves on me in some way, but i also sorta create them. Like with the “friend eating me” one, i definitely exacerbated that by impulsively thinking of the scariest thing possible. It’s NOT LIKE i think these things are real in any way, or that it’s actually happening to me, or that my friends would do this kind of stuff to me. It’s more like my brain is creating things to be stressed about.

When i do have these thoughts, they usually cause a huge drop where my body goes into full fight-or-flight. I can get over it pretty quick and then fall asleep but it’s just super jarring.

This is my first time posting on Reddit, but I have been having the worst anxiety lately. I am having a minor surgery on Monday for a deviated septum I have on the left side of my nose. I joke it’s an “internal nose job,” since the appearance of my nose won’t change at all haha. I have struggled with breathing because of my deviated septum for 5 years now and I know I am making the right choice, but I have this belief &amp; fear that I may die during the surgery. When I got my wisdom teeth out 4 years ago &amp; was put partially under anesthesia I felt the same way. I cried so hard after because I truly felt I was going to die. I know this is so irrational &amp; my doctor has reminded me because of my age (23) and health that I will be okay, but I can’t stop this fear. I know once Monday comes and I do it &amp; start to heal &amp; actually breathe I will be so grateful, but until Monday I just cannot stop worrying. Has anyone else ever felt this way? What have you done to remind yourself you’re okay? It’s hard to explain to anyone else who just doesn’t know what it’s like to be so afraid of dying, since that is the number one cause of my anxiety.

#### 1. Remain in your time region

Nervousness is a future-situated perspective. So as opposed to stressing over what will occur, “reel yourself back to the present,” says Tamar Chansky, Ph.D., a therapist and creator of Freeing Yourself from **Anxiety**. Ask yourself: What’s going on at the present moment? Am I safe? Is there something I need to do at this moment? If not, make an “arrangement” to check in with yourself later in the day to return to your concerns so those removed situations don’t lose track, she says.

#### 2. Practice Mindfulness

Work on seeing your thoughts, rather than reacting normally to them. Consider your contemplations fogs drifting by. Which pulls in you and which makes you need to escape? Is there a way you can **disentangle yourself** and basically notice your insights, rather than reacting?

#### 3. Focus on Direct Experience

Your mind makes up accounts about what your character is, and about your security and lovableness. Not these records are exact. Sometimes our minds are uneven by negative past experiences. What is your inclusion with the current second? Is this something that is truly happening or something that may happen? Notice that they are not something fundamentally the same as, not with standing the way that your cerebrum may see them as the same.

#### 4. Stay in the Present

Is your mind regurgitating the past? Since something negative happened in the past doesn’t mean it needs to happen today. Ask with respect to whether the conditions or your knowledge and adjusting limits have changed since the last time. As an adult, you have more choices about whom to associate with and more prepared to recognize, gain, or leave a **terrible situation** than when you were youth or youngster.

#### 5. Get Up and Get Going

Stressing over an issue without making an answer won’t assist you with tackling the issue. It might, indeed, make you more averse to act by taking care of your **uneasiness**. At the point when your psyche is stuck in a circle, you can intrude on it by getting up and moving around or doing an alternate assignment or action. At the point when you sit down, you ought to have an alternate point of view.

#### 6. Attempt Cognitive De-Fusion

Quit being melded with your musings. Consider your contemplations moving information crossing your thoughts, instead of the target truth about a circumstance. Our cerebrums are touchy to danger and risk since this kept our **progenitors** alive in nature. A portion of your considerations may simply be programmed adapted responses produced by a mind that is situated to endurance. Pick whether to accept these contemplations, instead of simply tolerating them.

#### 7. Pick Whether a Thought Is Helpful

Since thought is real doesn’t suggest that it is valuable to focus on — on any occasion not continually. In case one 1 of each 10 people will land the position you search for, and you keep thinking about those changes, you may become **demotivated** and not difficult to apply. This is a representation of a thought that is certifiable anyway not steady. Focus on what is helpful and delivered the rest!

#### 8. Label Things

Mark the kind of thought you are having, as opposed to focusing on its substance. Watch your musings and when you notice a judgment (e.g., how positive or negative the circumstance is), feel free to mark it as **Judging**. In the event that you notice a concern (e.g., that you will fall flat or experience a misfortune) mark it as Worrying. In the event that you are reprimanding yourself, mark it as Criticizing. This moves you away from the strict substance of your contemplations and gives you more mindful of your psychological cycles. Would you like to invest your energy in judging and stressing? Are there less critical or stressful approaches to see the circumstance?

#### 9.Feel Everything

At times the offender behind a hustling mind is that we’re not being **straightforward** with our own feelings. At the point when we stew over an issue, we may be subliminally attempting to abstain from feeling something we would prefer not to feel, similar to disgrace, envy, or bitterness. Our effusive brain may be giving us a prod to look somewhat more profound into what’s happening. It is difficult to feel all the feels. Now and again we try not to go there on the grounds that it’s excessively agonizing. Yet, when you let that poo out, you can release that poo.

You can respect your feelings by dealing with it, conversing with somebody, or in any event, having a **decent shout**. At the point when you permit yourself to feel those feelings, you can strip back the layers and draw nearer to your center self.

#### 10. Breathe

At the point when your noticing mind discovers your loquacious psyche running off to pressure land, one approach to find yourself mixed up with the present is to relax. Take a couple of profound, large gut breaths. Your body will give you signs when you’re focused: Your heart may begin to race, your palms may get sweat-soaked, or you may feel a little squeezy; get comfortable with these pointers and when you notice them, relax. It’ll help the hustling considerations settle.

Incline toward your faculties. You can zero in on how your breath expands and empties your midsection, or how the air feels moving all through your noses. Notice what’s around you. What do you hear, see, feel, smell? In case you’re out for a walk, take a gander at the trees, the complicated folds of a blossom’s petals, or even the examples on the concrete you’re strolling on. This can take you back to the second before you.

This provides your garrulous brain a little opportunity to stop and think about the thing you’re ruminating over. It turns down the commotion, so you can dial into what your internal truth is advising you.

Due to the pandemic we're booking out into July at some of our clinics, between trying to schedule all the people who cancelled or missed their appointments last year, and complying with capacity limits. I already have to do with people yelling at me because we're booking out so far, but we just found out last week that one of our doctors is moving out of state.

We had appointments booked for her into June. So that means we have like 200 appointments to reschedule for her. And because all of our other doctors are already booked to the max, we have nothing to offer them. So we have to tell people that scheduled their appointments in December that we won't be able to see them until July.

It's stressing me out so much that I feel a sinking dread every time I see a call come into the queue for that clinic, because all I have to offer is bad news.

1549,emilyherr666,1613707083,"Alright friends, here it goes. I’ve been dealing with Panic Disorder for about six months now. After months of hard work, I have finally gotten to the point where I can say that anxiety does not control me anymore. Here is what has been the most helpful to me on my journey: 
1. Overcoming this is like doing one giant TRUST FALL with your mind. You have to build the trust again. Every time you Google a sensation, or fixate on it, or check your body for symptoms or try to figure out a way to STOP the sensation you are feeling you are telling your body that you do not TRUST it. Do what you have to do to get the diagnosis that you are healthy, then TRUST IT. Anxiety can do sooo many things to you: Dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, headaches, pressure in your head, tension and pain in your shoulders and back, eye floaters, light sensitivity, flashes of light, visual auras, gas pain in EVERY part of your body - I had it in my SHOULDERS one time, heart burn, loss of appetite, and the kickers: BRAIN FOG, dissociation, random aches and pains, muscle spasms, ringing in your ears, loss of hearing, muscle weakness, throat tension/swallowing and breathing difficulty, etc. Do not underestimate what this can do to you. (I recommend one book for learning to trust that these symptoms really ARE JUST ANXIETY: Anxiety: Panicking about Panic by Josh Fletcher). Step one is to convince yourself that you are HEALTHY. 
2. You have to change your reaction. PANIC IS A RESULT OF AN UNHEALTHY THOUGHT PATTERN. That is all it is. It is a habit of thinking the wrong things to the point where you freak out. Changing this thought pattern is the key to changing your anxiety. Think about what you do when you feel the first sensation: do you start immediately searching for other things wrong that may collectively mean you have some terrible disease? Do you start googling your symptoms only to convince yourself you feel more things on the website you ended up on? Do you start ruminating about that one sensation and focus on it until you can’t focus on anything else?  Do you seek out somewhere you can lay down and curl up into a ball and wait it out? Yes, you do. And it’s time to stop. Doing ANY of this sends the signal to your brain that you believe you are in danger and it will ramp up the adrenaline in response. AVOIDANT BEHAVIOR REINFORCES ANXIOUS FEELINGS. Create an anxiety routine. This routine will take practice at first but you must stick to it until it becomes second nature. This routine is what will pull you out of your “emotional brain” (the brain that MISINTERPRETS anxiety as an actual threat) and snap you back into your “logical brain” (the brain that lets you think for yourself, that minimizes the sensations you are feeling to the point where you no longer feel you are in danger). My routine:
A. Check pulse oximeter &amp; blood pressure to convince myself that my vitals look just as great as the last time I was seen at the doctor 
B. Repeat my key phrases over and over (with vigor!) until they “click” (these must be specific to whatever health issue you are fixated on at the time to be effective- I will leave my specific ones out to avoid any triggers); This is just anxiety, I am not in danger; I do NOT have to think of a solution to this, I TRUST my body, people are perfectly capable of surviving even the worst medical conditions without panicking about them beforehand, you have been tested for everything under the sun and you are HEALTHY, trust the doctors, trust that your body knows how to work WITHOUT you telling it how to, my body is only trying to protect me and I need to THANK it for trying to keep me safe, I will stop feeling dissociated when my brain feels it no longer needs to protect me. 
C. Do not remove yourself from the situation that you were in when the anxiety first started. Stay there until you feel you can cope. If you are at work, don’t leave your desk. Just give yourself a moment to focus on the anxiety and to talk back to the anxiety until you feel your logical brain “wake up”. You will know it’s awake when you feel your consciousness rise above the fixation on these symptoms and you become aware of your surroundings again. 
D. Accept &amp; allow. This comes straight out of the book “Dare” by Barry McDonaugh(another high recommendation). Once your logical brain is awake you ROLL WITH THE ANXIOUS FEELINGS. Let them be there. Sit with them. Say hey what’s up throat tension I see you, you can hangout if you want. Let it be. Do not give it the energy of thinking it “away”. Just let it be there. Accept. This is what finally tells your brain that there is no danger. Only after this point will you feel the sensations start to decrease. Just let them be. Think of it this way: if you just got dumped and started crying your eyeballs out, would you hyper fixate on the mucus in your throat or in your nose or the water coming out of your eyes? No, because you know that’s what your body does when it’s sad so you LET IT BE. Think of the anxiety the same way you would crying: your body is having a normal physical reaction to an emotion and you just need to let it do it’s thing until it finds balance again. 
3. Mental ILLNESS should be treated exactly as it is: and ILLNESS. If you had the flu, what would you do? Rest, recover, and drink FLUIDS. Stay hydrated. You cannot expect your body to be at 100% right now, because it’s sick. It needs time to heal. Give your body what it needs to get that healing done: rest, lots of fluids, vitamins. Put a warm washcloth over your head like mama used to do. 
4. FORGIVE YOURSELF! You are a warrior! You face your worst fears every single day of your life and you OVERCOME! You are so much stronger for it and you will be a stronger person once this is over. Schedule in those self-care days. Say no to your obligations if you have to. Put YOURSELF first! This is a long journey but a rewarding one in the end.

Despite a few side effects, I feel somewhat relaxed on my first day of medication. As I write this, I am tearing up but not full on balling tears like I usually would be. Guess that's a plus. 

The thing that hurts the most is, I don't think my parents agree with me being on medication and believe that the key to getting better is to ""lose weight"" and ""lessen the amount of caffeine"". Though those things are valid, its not something that would greatly help. When I complained of feeling nervous and my throat feeling tight the week before, they thought that it could be some spring allergies. I explained many times that it was not and I was feeling nervous, but was ignored. I even took the walk that they suggested but didnt feel better. 

They have been avoiding the topic of my medication and how I am on the journey to getting better. No words of support have been offered. It also gets quiet when I'm around, like they are ignoring me. All they can think of is the side effects. When they talk about it. Its always in a hushed tone

My friends have also kept their distance. 

I never understood how people could be so distant. Maybe they don't know what to do or how to help.

After leaving my therapists office, still pretty upset I was waiting for my ride(my car doesn’t have signal lights right now so I didn’t want to drive it so I had my roommate Pick me up) and then I received a snap from this girl I was supposed to go on a date with tonight, she hit me with the classic “oh hi I actually don’t want to go on a date with you, I just don’t think we’re compatible, okay bye” out of no where and deleted me off snap before I could say anything. Which is whatever, I mean I wish she gave me more of a reason, we were speaking for a while and I thought it was going in a good direction, clearly I was wrong. But anyways, It is what it is.

Does a man showing up by himself to see the girl indicate that he is somewhat interested?

Just a little background: the culture is very conservative. Usually families will introduce their children to each other. It’s not an arranged marriage though. I know, a very old fashioned way of doing things.

I come from a mixed household and I’ve been crushing on this guy for a long time (13 years). I’m 27F. 

His name is Alex and his parents are close friends with my dad’s older brother and wife. They have known each other since before I was born. 

Alex’s mom has always liked me for her son. A couple years ago, she told my mom that they have been looking for a suitable wife for Ali. They have looked around for other young woman, but, they always come back to me. She said that every time she sees me, she thinks of her son. She believes we would be perfect for each other. 

I was so shocked and very flattered after hearing about that. It was so kind. 

Nothing happened after that. His family maintained their distance from my parents. I felt so disappointed and moved Ali out of my mind. 

Then just a few days ago, Alex’s mom called my mom and referred to the conversation they had a couple years prior. She said that it’s time for me and her son to meet. My mom specifically asked her that Alex wasn’t feeling forced or pressured into meeting me. That he’s coming over (to my house) with an open heart and open mind. 

His mom assured my mom that he agreed and that he wants to meet me (I guess they had brought me up to him). 

So this weekend he is coming to my house on his own, without his parents. He’s 31 years old. He’s never been to my house, and, he doesn’t know my parents. It feels so surreal that this is happening. It’s quite bold of him to be showing up at my door on his own. I was just thinking to myself that if he wasn’t interested, he wouldn’t be showing up in the first place, right? He’s making an effort to show up, there has to be some genuine curiosity. This has never happened before. 

I feel excited but very nervous because no man has ever showed up to my house specifically to meet me. We have never spoken to each other before but we have seen each other. 

Is this a good sign? 

I’ve waited to meet him for so long. Honestly, I hope it’s not disappointing. I hope we really do click and enjoy ourselves. I’d really like to get to know him better.

1. I should be allowed to take breaks from class if I have a panic attack

Also ,I've recently realized that I'm super fucking sensitive to everything,like not only to alcohol or caffeine ,cigarettes (which I've cut out from my life for years now-all three of them) but also to everything that happens around or inside me.  sometimes I get a feeling that It's something special, I really do feel how my brain plays games and it amazes me how  it can make me very nervous at one moment and then be completely calm if i menage to think through it rationally . like I'm ""over-realizing"" the power of my brain and mind- though that's not helpful at all .I'm always overthinking and my thoughts are negative mostly,i almost don't have social life anymore,i don't know how to trust people -all because I'm not feeling well in my skin. And don't get me wrong- I don't underestimate the power of positive thinking ,healthy lifestyle and all-I wanna do all of those things but they are very extremely hard for me to do because I'm really melancholic and sad person who's addicted to sadness.

I deal with anxiousness for a fwe years now. Overthinking, worrying and hating myself for ""mistakes"" I made in the past. Reliving them and making me and people around me miserable.

I used weed to ""treat"" myself and in the end it was making it stronger. I am on r/leaves and know that anxiety also comes with weed. But I am quiete sure it was also masking sth in me.

I am afraid of taking medication or even take a step to talk to my doctor about it. I still hope that with more time and the sport/yoga nidra meditation/good food/journaling/breathing etc I will get more resiliant.

But I am worrying basically on a daily basis and it is also bad for my partner.

I am afraid of medication but do not know if I should.

1614,risha2019,1613689946,"Does anyone else like to think of anxiety like a cup - the cup is your capacity and every time you encounter something stressful or depressing, you add water to your cup. Eventually all the things adds up and overflows and that’s when we experience panic attacks and anxiety symptoms.

I guess it’s a good way to explain if you’re suffering a set back. I’m currently going through one where I’ve felt a lot better for the past couple of months but this past week, I’ve been preparing to move cities and start my first full time job in almost a year. I’ve been having horrendous panic attacks every day and I think it’s because my cup is almost full with all the stress of moving that a little thing that would usually just make me a tiny bit nervous is enough to fill my cup until it spills over.

So I guess that means that anxiety isn’t an indication on whether you’re making progress because for the small issues that I used to stress over, they’re getting better but because of the newer big issues I’m currently dealing with, it means that the small issues have become big anxiety triggers again. If that makes any sense! Basically, if you think you’re having a setback, check that you cup isn’t filled with other bits of liquid before assuming you’re not getting better 😊

I met with my therapist and I felt alot better, and felt better once I was able to lay down and relax. Then my visitor showed up! So I knew that was the reason. 

Today: body is tired from being tense, i feel mentally better. Happens every month. Pms is a bitch. But there were a few things today that tripped out my literal every day routine. Not even bad things, either!!! Ane I've just felt some slight panic once I realized how fast the day has gone by. My daughter was getting her energy out and was jumping on me and I  instantly had a panic attack. I let her jump on me and just turned YouTube on and within about less than 30 seconds i was fine again but wtffff. That fear was terrible. These past few days are the worst I've had in a LONG TIME.

My new SO (35M) texted me (25F) first yesterday and I got excited because we had a discussion about my texting anxiety last week - and how I want him to initiate sometimes. He listened and was very receptive IMO. He also has his own anxiety around communication so he was very understanding.

So, he reached out first yesterday with two texts and I was so excited so I responded with three short texts all ending in an emoji each. He did respond once and we left it at that. But I’ve been since low key worrying if I overused emojis like an immature buffoon. Fast forward to today, I texted him asking for some interview tips (I am going on a radio show for the first time tmr. He works in broadcast so I wanted to ask for some advice, and also honestly to talk to him). 

I got a response unrelated to my question which I suspect that he’s supposed to send to a coworker or so (it’s very technical). I just responded with “??” but haven’t heard from him since. I think it’s a bit weird and now I’m super nervous what’s going on. My socially anxious brain can’t comprehend. Now I’m scared again if it is because I showed too much enthusiasm yesterday.

1625,_Platypus1105,1613687119,"I haven’t read it after myself, English is not my first language. Sorry for that 

I’m 20, healthy, just started university, everything is going quite okay but I cannot shake off this feeling that I have to make sure that my parents are happy. I feel like all of the time I’m spending with them is still not enough and that it’s slipping through my fingers. 

Family has always been a huge part of my life, like huge huge. It feels like apart from family there isn’t anything I actually care about. 
Especially now, because I distanced myself from friends, mostly because I don’t feel like I wanna be with them. I don’t have a partner, so the only people in my life I want to spend my time with are my parents.

I’m really trying to be happy and okay with myself. I’m trying to be somewhat productive. 
I’ve also stopped cutting myself - it has never been a huge problem, it’s just a way how I deal with stress, sadness and anger. And now I’m dealing with that mostly by hitting my forearm  on the edge of the table. Or I’m trying to breathe properly and do some breathing exercises to calm myself down. I started “exercising”, to feel good, 10 mins a day, nothing huge. I quit laying in bed in the morning for endless hours, when I have to do school stuff I sit at the table and Im actually trying to do the stuff. 
I know it’s small stuff, but it’s something I manage to regularly do. 

And even though I’m doing these new things that are supposed make me feel somewhat better, i feel like it’s not enough. And that even if it would be enough I’m not that important. 
I don’t care what happens to me, I just wish I would feel like I’m enough. 

Or, uh I don’t know, maybe if there would be couple of days I wouldn’t think about everything. 

In a way, this could probably be bcs of corona and quarantine, but when I think about how miserable I was 1-2 years ago, I’m telling myself that I should be happy now. 

I’m having dreams where my exes/friends are blaming me for the failure of the relationship. 

And all of this stuff is in my head, the need to hurt myself to be able to escape a situation, the idea of being failure to the people in my surroundings. Etc. And that’s fucked up, I wish I would be more sunshine everywhere. And not questioning everything I do.

I hadn’t had friends all through highschool on account of my poor social skills and my fear of talking to people. So now i’m in college i put myself out there (as far as one can in these trying times) and i got involved with this pre-existing friendgroup. I still really can’t text or call with them out of fear of screwing up and them abandoning me (without copious amounts of alcohol that is). So these folks invite me to group texts and snap groups etc etc but i really am just frightened of using them. Im rambling now so new subject.

Uhh so when we were zooming and drinking one of them starts laughing at a meme and sends it to the group chat. I received nothing. Immediately my brain goes into overdrive (oh no, for the umpteenth time im the guy people make separate groupchats to avoid) and i fall into the biweekly loop of insecurity, self loathing and suicidal thoughts, etc etc. Turns out it was just an insta group im not a part of (I don’t have instagram) and now my basis for my suspicions about them not actually liking me and just putting up with me is gone. So I should be relieved or something but I can’t shake that feeling to the point i keep all but convincing myself they hate me.

I think I can claim that I was pretty successful throughout my life. Although my family is not in a good condition financially, I managed to gain acceptance to one of the best high schools in my home country, and after I finished my studies in my high school, I was also admitted to one of the best universities, again in my home country. I finished my bachelor's degree ranked second in my department, and I was admitted to an integrated Ph.D. program in a top 30 university worldwide in my field.

It all started to go upside down last year. I experienced a severe heartbreak and one of my peers in my current program committed suicide. After that, covid happened. 

I decided not to continue with my Ph.D. studies. I realized that this was not what I wanted, and I really felt like my investment in the last 6 years was for nothing.

I still try to finish my master's degree but it seems like I won't be able to complete it. There's no motivation left inside me.

For the last 1.5 years, I'm experiencing severe anxiety attacks. I really feel like I wasted my potential for nothing, and since it seems like I'll drop out of the master's phase, the chances that I'll find a decent job is really low. I think job givers will see me as a failure.

I don't really know what to do with my life. I don't know what I want, and I don't know how I'll be able to cope with all this stuff. I haven't felt this weak in my entire life.

I was w her flatmate's boyfriend hanging out when she texted me, so I knew that she would be alone at their place. We had already had a few dates the year before but things weren't going anywhere and nothing actually happened (we're both really shy and none of us made a move) so we decided to stay friends. Anyway, I was still in love w her and I new she still liked me but nothing had happened since then.

The thing is that we were drunk on her bed about to make out when we decided to talk first. We spent an hour nervously trembling as we talked about how we felt. She told me she liked me but that she didn't see herself in a relationship w me (she has recently ended w smn she was in love with that pretty much used her and played her feelings) and told me she didn't want to do the same to me. I told her that I was in love w her but that I just wanted to figure things out and see where things could go.

Well, we made out, got naked, eat her out until she had an orgasm and have fun. I was really comfortable but when she was on top of me about to have sex for the first time I didn't even get hard. I was really comfortable w her, but not aroused. I don't understand. I've had sexual fantasies about her. I've been turned on by her just being sitted next to me. I've masturbated thinking about her. And when I had her naked in front of me w a condom in her mouth about to have sex w her... nothing. She was really comprehensive and told me it was fine. Then we laughed, caressed each other and cuddled until we ""slept"" (I didn't sleep at all and she didn't fall asleep until 6 a.m). 

It's been four days and I haven't got horny at all, not even a bit. Not even recalling when I was eating her out. No libido at all. Today I jerked off but I forced myself to get hard (first time since Saint Valentines on the morning, before any of this happened), I wasn't aroused. WTF? Have I watched too much porn? Am I gay? Have I lost my libido? 

I got aroused when she texted me telling me she had a bottle of gin to share w me. I did when we were about to make out before we talked. But since that happened, nothing. I'm freaking out.

1654,StereotypicalB1tch,1613677579,"I (F16) got directed here from another post because this morning some thieves broke into my garden and tried stealing my bikes during the night. It's gotten me all worked up because the thieves couldn't have wanted to steal my bikes because they happened to see me once. They must've seen me multiple times. I.e they live close by.

It's got me into a panic because It's making me worry for the safety of my dog. The thieves were unsuccessful because we have a huge heavy duty chain. But they managed to scale my fence, bust the lock on the gate and shed door and tried wrangling them free. I'm anxious and scared and I feel that they'll come back.

My dog is a pedigree pug and she's the classic 'pug look' with the cream fur. I posted this all on r/advice and I was suggested to take an anxiety test.

I scored 55/88 points but I'm questioning if its just because of my recent traumas. Some of the questions asked if your heart has been racing a lot, or if you're trembling a lot.

Two weeks ago my mum tried breaking into my house and smashing my window with bricks while I was home alone. That's guaranteed to get anyone's heart racing, right? 

I'm generally a really chatty person. I talk to people easily and I'm very outspoken. Surely I can't have anxiety because my personality is too outgoing and friendly. But 2-3 times a week I'll be in my room and I'll get into a slump. Something will tick me off and I'll either cry or I'll be on the verge of it. I'll rethink my life choices and my weight. And I'll compare myself to others and repeat in my head ""I'll have better luck in my next life."" 

I've tried having therapy. I've talked to my school counsellor but it's no good. I don't act stressed in the meetings and I don't cry. I only had 3 before I quit because I didn't feel like he was helping. He completely shut down my idea of having a Bipolar Disorder test because of my genetics. Both my mum and Grandma have Bipolar Disorder, and my Grandmother's Mum commit suicide when she was 15. She's certain if she was alive now she'd have Bipolar too. 

I've been rethinking it lately and maybe my Counsellor and I weren't a good match. For a start he was a stable man in his 50s- so how could he advise a (then) 15 year old girl? 

I only know one person with anxiety and...we're somewhat similar I guess. She's not very talkative to people aside from her friends but she's really bubbly in a situation she's comfortable in. Aside from being friendly we're nothing alike. So how could I have anxiety when I'm nothing like a person with anxiety?

I live in a small town in the UK and my only parental guardian is my dad. It's not like I can just ask him to book me in for a counselling session, especially when I've refused the free advances from my school. I feel like the only way I can do something is when I turn 18 because then I can do it for myself.

i have a sensitive gag reflex but when i'm anxious or stressed the problem gets twice as bad. i went to see a doctor today and she had to do a throat swab. i was fine with it until she pressed down on my tongue with a wooden stick. i began gagging so much that she had to stop, and i kept on dry heaving although she was doing nothing??? she had to take me to a sink and give me a plastic bag and i just kept going. if i had eaten something right before going i'm sure i would have puked for real.

i was obviously embarrassed and apologized a million times and thankfully she was super sweet and let me take my time to breathe and calm down. in the end we were able to take the throat swab with a bit of struggling and right when it was over i no longer felt the need to gag. 

whenever i get anxiety i get this lump in my throat and i have to stop it from getting to the point of gagging. it's horrible and i don't know how to make it better. when i think about the feeling (that was the cause of the gagging fit with the throat swab too) it gets really bad, and apparently it could really make me throw up. i can't even brush my teeth without feeling like gagging if i think about it.

so, does anyone else have this problem? how do you deal with it?? it makes me embarrassed to go to see a doctor or a dentist and i wonder if i could train myself somehow to control it a bit better.",Anxiety,anxiety and gag reflex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lmvbpn/anxiety_and_gag_reflex/,1613648613.0
1656,MakeupMua16,1613677229,"Long but definitely worth the read! 

About 3-4 years ago I was put on medication because I had went to my previous primary doctor for a checkup for I don’t even remember but my doctor and mom were talking about anxiety because I can’t even go to a doctors appointment by myself because of how nervous I was all the time about everything. So my doctor at the time told my mom what about trying Zoloft so I did thinking nothing of it. I didn’t even know what anxiety was at the time.

 Then I started seeing a counselor and in that same office there was a psychiatrist my counselor recommended me trying that she said would help with my medicine more so than my primary doctor. So I did I went and saw him I Don’t even know how many anxiety was at the time being on Zoloft but all I remember when I first started experiencing full on anxiety was, that I had saw a new doctor for a check up because I was experiencing weird itching down there and she did a blood test and apparently the Zoloft caused Weight gain that I didn’t even notice until looking back at pictures of myself how much weight I gained. That blood test showed I was one point over in the pre-diabetic range. 

So that threw me into a huge panic attack for the first time I ever had a panic attack in my life. I experienced my first bout of derealization and depersonalization it felt like I was in constant panic after receiving the bad news about being ever so slightly pre diabetic. It lasted about the next 4 months or so. I had panic attack after panic attack like I was living in straight panic like the attack came on day 1 didn’t go away ever it was just there constantly 24/7. In the worst of it all I developed insomnia, full body tremors inside my body and constantly felt that I needed to pace around and I couldn’t sit still it was the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. So we tried Zoloft and when I told my psych about the weight gain we came off then we tried peroxitine and citalopram which I don’t think I gave enough time to work so that’s why we switched so much because I was looking for immediate relief not something that took 4 to 8 weeks to work. So my doctor put me on Valium which I feel like somewhat helped but coming off was hell. I was experiencing tremors for about a couple weeks until I was fully off of the medicine. 

Then I went and saw a different primary doctor and she put me on Effexor. That really helped my anxiety a lot I was only on 37.5 mg so I thought if I came off my anxiety would still be the same as it was on and I won’t have any more anxiety ever again I was wrong about four months later I developed a really bad panic attack for the second time in my life went to the er countless times over it and I finally told my doctor to put me back on it even though I gained weight from it I’d rather have the weight gain then have horrible anxiety. Now I’m struggling whether to stay on again because it’s helping my anxiety or to come off because it’s making me gain so much weight that I’m worried about diabetes like what happened when I took Zoloft in the beginning. I really want to come off all medication but I feel like a s soon as a month or even years later off I’m going to have panic attacks again and I’m afraid of derealization or depersonalization because that the symptom the medication definitely have basically cured me from. 

So now so torn with what to do I know anxiety medication definitely helps my anxiety but it just has made it so hard to come off. I would like to eventually be medication free and live a normal life like I was before Zoloft even if I was considered shy. I didn’t develop panic attacks from being shy or any of the symptoms I do now. And it sucks I don’t know how to deal with it. If anyone has some insight on this please er me know what I should do!

I am on a state list (not US) that makes me available to calls from schools for teaching jobs. I teach philosophy and history but in my country it is more common to be called for 'helping' (don't really know how to translate it, basically it is the additional teacher that helps kids with disabilities in class).  


I was called last year and did about two months in a school. First days were tragic but in the end I overcame it and now that I think about it I kinda enjoyed helping those kids. On tuesday I was called in another school, this time in my own town too! (the other was 40 km /20 miles away, so it should be better right?)  


Well, it is kinda strange. On 18 hours, I only have 6 with a kid. Those hours are smooth, they chat a bit because they are kids but it is ok. The other 12 hours, the school put me on a 'helping list'. Basically there is a chance that the day before I get an email that says 'hey tomorrow you have 3 available hours , the first one you will have to go supervise this class since their teacher will be absent'  


I don't know why but this gives me severe anxiety. I always feel like 'man what if they call me to a class of loud and unpolite kids and I will not be able to keep them at bay?' I only started on tuesday and today I had some substituions but it actually went ok (I wasn't alone, other teachers were there)  


How do I overcome this anxiety? Right now the only thing that is pushing me is repeating myself 'hold on, even if it gets bad this contract will end on March 20th so it's just 21 more days. I even made a sketch on paper with boxes that I cross out everyday but I feel a bit pathetic :/

1675,wille2431,1613670970,"Hi all, this isn’t my first time posting on here,

I been dealing with anxiety for about 8 years (diagnosed at 11 and I’m currently 19). It’s been really hard. I’ve been on and off medication and therapy when I was younger.

My anxiety lately has been really bad. I’m currently at a community college and I’m about to transfer to an university. I am currently questioning my major and deciding on to change it before I transfer. My education has always been really important. Change has always been one of the things that makes my anxiety and panic attacks really really bad. I normally have a back up plan with everything. But I never had a backup major so that’s causing me a lot of anxiety right now because it’s my future. And whatever I choose right now, it will effect my life until I die. 

When I do have really bad anxiety’s and panics attacks, I normally associate items/objects/things with that anxiety. For example, last semester a class and a professor gave me so much anxiety’s and panic attacks. I ended up dropping the class but i remember sitting at my desk and crying and having panic attacks in the middle of class and I was home alone. That Professor really traumatized me not because of the class but how he responded when I emailed him about me having anxiety and it was hard for me to really focus. I now associate my desk to that professor and that time when I had panic attacks and really bad anxiety. I bought a new desk because I couldn’t see that desk because it was a trigger for me. I know it sounds so stupid but that’s how my anxiety is. 

The thing is, I love my current major. I’m currently an architecture major. I love the creative and the process. I don’t know how to explain it but I can’t imagine myself doing architecture for the rest of my life. It’s like a gut feeling. Another thing with my anxiety, it makes me hate (little by little) what I like to do. Like hobbies and etc. my anxiety has made me hate my current major little by little with every panic attack I have and when I have anxiety. It also made me hate other things as well. I know associate architecture as a trigger for my anxiety. It’s really hard because I’m passionate about it but it’s also another trauma for me. 

The thing is, I have other options/decisions I can take. Either suck it up and transfer as an architect major. Stay at my community college and get an associates degree in another major and maybe transfer to a university depending on  what degree I need to get. But I feel like any decision I make, will be the worst. I always over analyze everything and I give myself anxiety. I feel like what ever I do, I’m going to regret it and I won’t be happy.  I’m going to think “what if” I did this instead or that and then im going to give myself more anxiety. It’s a never ending cycle. 

My family is supportive of whatever decision I make and I’m so grateful for that. But I feel like a failure. Like whatever I pick or do, I’m going to fail. I’m tired of feeling like this. I’m currently in therapy at my school but they can only offer me a couple sessions. I’m not on medication right now. I have a deductible with my medical insurance and I can’t afford it. They expect me to pay $1000 of a deductible and $1000 every time I go to the doctor. I’m not sure how this works. My mom and I have been calling crazy to my insurance but I can’t afford that. So I’m stuck. I feel really hopeless. I hate feeling like this all the time.

Any advice/opinion is really appreciative. I’m trying to get as much advice that I can before I make a huge decision. Thank you again. Sorry for the rant.",Anxiety,Advice needed!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lmspqb/advice_needed/,1613642170.0

Anyway ive had such severe anxiety, derealization and stress since this started and I just want my life back. I've seen clinical psychs several timesheet, taken evaluations, etc and been told I just have severe anxiety after adjusting to the baby. They said no red flags whatsoever as far as my fears. But my mind can't stop, it thinks ""what if I'm fine now...but in the future I'll lose it"". I keep seeing triggering shit on the news and fb, just yesterday about a dude in Cali that shot his fiance and someone else because ""they were trying to set him up"" he kept saying. Everyone's claiming he's mentally ill. My mind goes directly to ""omfg....what if I do that to my fiance and our baby??"" And it kills me.

1679,JusticeBeaverisI,1613670592,"My anxiety is all consuming but especially at the doctors office. My heart rate and bp raise way too high(not dangerously high just way higher than they should), I get shaky and ask nervous questions. Even my voice goes tight. One thing I always do though, is apologize. I apologize to nurses and doctors for panicking and everytime they or I mention it more sorrys come flooding out. I’m unsure why this is my response to my anxiety but it is. I never realized how crazy I sounded until a nurse notated it. 

I had a stress test done at the outpatient area in a hospital. I went because my anxiety gives me chest pains and flutters and I wanted to know if it was my anxiety or an actual issue(guess what one it is 🤦‍♀️) so my doctor sent me to a cardiologist for testing. 

I arrived incredibly nervous. My heart rate to start was 130. They started worrying around me which made me even more scared so I think I went up to 150. They kept questioning why I was scared so I apologized so many times for being nervous. 

The test ended and I got the results scan(normal) and the comments at the top said “Patient arrived extremely anxious and kept saying “I’m sorry” over and over again”

I was mortified and embarrassed but mostly ashamed that I’m apologizing for my issues. Why the hell should I apologize for my struggle!? Am I like normal people? No. I have an anxiety disorder but it doesn’t mean I’m less of a human and it’s nothing to be sorry for at all. I need special care at doctors office but that’s no reason to be ashamed.

I know how stupid this sounds but it is one of the reasons why I can't relax even when I'm by myself. I have this fear of doing fine movements because I'm shaky and look stupid doing so. E.g. walking to an object, grabbing an object, doing things that require a little bit of coordination. 

When I was a kid I had no problem doing so, and I was very confident in my physical abilities, but this is the main reason why my self-confidence is so low. I know how to do things, but I can't because my body is so stiff. I always feel observed, even by myself.

I get these rushes where I feel like getting rid of a lot of my belongings. 

It tends to follow the concepts of minimalism; only keeping what I “need”, but my tendencies are more so to scratch an itch. 

Sometimes I just feel annoyed by everything around me and want to get rid of it. It’s currently 3am and I just finished getting rid of about 2 garbage bags worth of stuff. It feels addicting

After cleaning everything out then cleaning my room, I walk around and feel so restless and want to find more to do, but can’t. I then get these thoughts in my head of wanting to leave. I don’t mean it in a suicidal way, nor do I even have a specific place in mind, it’s just this feeling of wanting to leave. 

I feel scared to sleep or even get in my bed. I want to smoke weed again, but I’ve gone 2 weeks without it and want to keep that up. 

Not too long ago, I was waking up at 7:30am, going for jogs, working out and showering. 



Now that feels so impossible and I’ve adopted my nocturnal schedule again.



I replay all my recent social interactions in my head and cringe immensely. I feel like I have so many problems and I nit pick every little thing I say. I psychoanalysis myself to the point it drives me crazy and every little move I make feels so amplified. 

It gets to the point I want to retract and isolate myself away in my room. Isolate has a negative connotation, but it’s something that has always provided great comfort.

This is something almost anyone has to do in the business/tech industry, or any freaking industry. Meetings are essential and obvious occurrences. Today I had to facilitate a meeting. Which isn’t my first or last time, but I hate it every time. Facilitating should be easy, just get people to talk about things and you write them down. Maybe ask some questions to get them going, basically let them do the talking. Somehow I suck at getting the people going. I don’t ask the right questions or possibly the wording is wrong. If someone asks me a question and I answer and they ask me to clarify, I freeze and basically repeat myself. Then I hear crickets until hopefully someone else jumps in. I feel like I sound so dumb and I freaking hate sounding dumb. I don’t want to be the dumb girl/woman/person. It doesn’t help that I work with my SO and they rock at communicating with people and everyone praises them all the time and loves them.

I tried to call my mom afterwords just to get some reassurance and all she said was “you need to get over that”. Thanks for the help. That’s what I’m going to say to you the next time you get defensive for thinking that dad thinks you’re dumb. I brought this meeting upon myself to grow, it’s not like it was forced upon me.

1687,zep97,1613667327,"So I (24f) just move into an apartment and I was sooo happy. I was finally was getting away from my family after living with them the past year because of covid. 

But all of that went to shit the moment I moved in. I can constantly hear my upstairs neighbors running, slamming doors, jumping off things, moving furniture, constantly from 5am to Midnight every day. My anxiety is spiking and I’ve already had 3 mental breakdowns. I finally worked up the courage to try and go talk to them. When I did a man barely peaked his head out from the door and I introduced myself and asked if I had been being loud and then asked if they could be more conscious because no one lived below them before but now someone was living under them (brand new apartment). He agreed and said he would try to fix it. 

Well another week goes by and no change, if anything it has gotten worse. So after being woken up at 5 am, two days ago, and listening to them be inconsiderate all day long, constant sporadic jumping, dropping heavy objects, running etc. I finally got my broom and banged on the ceiling a few times because I could no longer take it. I can’t even drown them out with a loud tv. And can’t tell you how many hours of sleep I’ve lost. 

Next thing I know, They’re banging on my door telling me to open up. This time it’s a woman. I start talking to her and she says “me and my boyfriend and 3 kids live upstairs.” And I said,,,ok but I’m going to be honest because of my anxiety I specifically looked at apartment complexes that had a max occupancy of 2 people in a one bedroom in the lease/addendums (the layout is the same for every floor so they’re in a one bedroom above me thats 650 sqft) so that there wouldn’t be an obscene amount of noise. This is when her large 6’-3” boyfriend comes around the corner (I didn’t know he was there) and starts yelling obscenities at me telling me I’m a bitch and fuck me if I go to management. It was so scary, I was thankful I had my friend in the apartment with me because as soon as the woman saw my friend get up and come to the door and saw I had someone else in here with me, she told her boyfriend to back off. Then she told me “I don’t have a problem with you”. I wanted to say, good, you shouldn’t because I’m not making any noise or disturbing you. But then she said there was nothing she can do about her children as they are kids. 

Well the cherry on top was that I had been recording the noise from earlier (to take to management/have documentation) and had forgot to turn off my voice memos before I answered the door. Our entire conversation, including her boyfriend yelling at me was all recorded. 

I finally wrote into management yesterday telling them about how they’re not following the lease and that it’s disturbing me in my home and I don’t feel safe having her aggressive boyfriend living above me. I can’t only imagine what would’ve happened if She didn’t calm him down. So happy I have the voice recording as proof as well as a witness. 

My anxiety is spiking to the point that I’m already mentally drained and now I’m feeling awful and super anxious for reporting them for violating the lease.

1688,vibrantearthcoffee,1613666866,"Hey all! I'm a 21 year old student that has struggled with social anxiety for his entire life. Recently I decided to start actively trying to overcome it, so I read a couple of books and started to apply the things I learned. But I noticed that it's hard to stay motivated to fill out CBT forms, 'expose' myself to social situations, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I had these motivation issues with some of my other goals as well, but finding a so-called 'accountability partner' helped me a lot. I even read somewhere that just having someone to keep you accountable increases the chance that you stick with your goals long-term from 10 to 95(!)%. I believe that for overcoming anxiety disorders it could be especially beneficial to have someone for support, accountability or just to sometimes vent to. That's why I was surprised when I found out that there's surprisingly little information about accountability partners for anxiety disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't completely thought this through yet but maybe we could meet (through chat😉) at least once a week to tell each other about our wins, struggles, learnings, etc and what we plan to do for overcoming our social anxiety the next week.

1691,okhithere72,1613665502,"This might be triggering for some so I am saying that here.

I am 19M and I have been having bad anxiety over my health both physical and mental over the past 2 months. It has developed into having fears of dying suddenly, having some horrible physical illness or disease like cancer, developing schizophrenia or psychosis, and the fear of potentially getting any of them. It truly is one of the most devastating things to ever happen in my life and I am really afraid of what may happen to me. I truly regret my decision for what I did..

Everything was normal in my life.. In December, school was ending and I couldn’t get the feeling of discomfort out of me after I got my grades. So I decided I wanted to get high. My dad uses medical marijuana and allowed me to use it a few times with him. I only used it 4 times till the time in December and all were very pleasant and fun experiences. However this time was very different and very bad. 

The product I took was an extra strength THC tincture that had hardly any CBD in it. I thought that the more THC, the better the high. So I put an entire dropper (1ml) under my tongue and swallow. Then, I decide to go online to see how much THC is good to take as an edible/tincture form. With my findings, I decide to consume another half a dropper. I consumed about 80-100mg of THC, thinking that I would get a really great high. I didn’t. It was much worse. And I regret it very much..

The high was so bad that I ended up going into my dads room and telling him everything I did. He comforted me through the hell I was witnessing in my head. It was the most panic inducing and most traumatizing event to ever happen to me in my life. After the bad high/trip, I was trying to fall asleep but I was panicking really bad. I managed to sleep, but I woke up the following day not being able to breathe. It made me fear going to sleep for a week. 

Everyday since has been filled with existential dread and anxiety. I have been fearing of having cancer, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses like bipolar, death, and the anxiety itself thinking it may never go away at times. My brain is so attached to these fears and it hooks them with valid reasons onto why I *might* have them. It’s so terrifying. The intrusive thoughts are really bad at times, especially at night and when I wake up. I even had times where I though I was hearing voices and that freaked me out. I had some mental breakdowns because of these things and at some point contemplated suicide. I did end up getting help.

My body has never been the same since and I really do hate for what I did. I have discussed a lot of what has been happening to me with my family and friends and they keep reassuring me that I am fine and will be fine. It’s hard for me to believe them when I can say I am experiencing these things. I don’t feel much hunger, I have a hot stomach, bad intrusive thoughts, all these fears, constant anxiety, visual snow, etc etc etc.... It really is hard and I just want to be normal again.

I take Zoloft 25mg and go to Christian counseling cause of my dad. And even now I question my faith and the decision to use drugs as that’s how I got into this mess. My dad says it’s all in my head and that you’ll be fine. Even many times, he’s been upset with me with the choices I have been making. I dropped my math classes this semester because it has been so hard to pick up my textbooks and work. I even contemplated taking a semester break with my counselor and my dad says I’m quitting school and that I’m being a quitter if I take many months off of school. He wants me to toughen up and “be a man, not a girl.” (He’s a conservative Christian). As much as he loves me a lot, he’s been really hard on me. I’ve been keeping my mouth shut when I’m around him only talking about “the good things” and not my actual feelings. Life has been really hard and really the only thing that has kept me sane is my brother, my friends, and lurking on Reddit as much as it gives me the reassurance that someone out there is suffering like me.

God help me. I really do regret what I did and I am terrified of so many things cause of it and my lifestyle. I haven’t been this open to my counselor and I am thinking about it. I really need a hug from someone who’s in the same boat or has been.

My current money situation is not the best. I work full time and I make a little over $2000 per month after tax. I do have a bit of money saved, about 35k in savings and investments. I am also in school part time, but my anxiety and depression really holds me back unfortunately. I am also working towards a degree in psychology, which everyone says is useless anyway. 

I am living in a room rental currently, but I have to get out because 1) the landlord is selling the house and 2) I have a really mean roommate that was stealing my things and putting gross shit in my food.

I am terrified that I wont be able to afford anything. I don’t have any furniture, so I am worried about paying for that. I am terrified that I am in over my head and I am going to drain my savings. I am also fully aware that a roommate situation would he best for me, but that is not an option for me. 

I also really need therapy. Right now, I can only afford to go once a month but it just isn’t enough. I only have negative thoughts, it’s controlling my life. I am afraid of everything. I feel really sick.

I've been feeling unmotivated and it's been hard focusing on my college work since everything at my parents house is complicated rn. My grandparents are my neighbours and one of them is completely dependent on my family to eat, shower and do daily tasks and my other grandparent suffers from mental health issues (depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder) so she can't handle living with my grandfather alone or else she has anxiety attacks and starts crying because it's difficult to deal with my grandfather as he's constantly asking the same questions and saying the same things. So my parents (mostly my mom) have been helping my grandfather doing daily tasks and hired someone to help in the morning but this isn't enough. On top of this, my grand-aunt also lives with them but was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer and since last week is staying at the hospital where she had her stomach removal surgery. She always helped my grandparents a lot but she'll come home next week very weakened and will need help doing everything (she can't even walk on her own). So the house will be full with two family elders totally dependent on someone and my grandmother severely depressed. My mother is exhausted and my brother (a recent graduate unemployed because of covid who had to comeback to his parents house and is also depressed) doesn't help a lot by having constant fights with my grandmother which results in her crying all day and consequently making my grandfather worried as well and more tiresome. I'm in the middle of this. I've been here for 3 weeks now and I have the possibility to go to the city where my uni is (despite only having online classes) to live with my friends and be with my boyfriend. The thing is my room in the other city doesn't have furniture so I need to buy a desk and so on and that also stresses me out. But if I stay here I don't know if my mental health will get worse. I've been staying over my grandparents house since my grandmother doesn't want to sleep alone with my grandfather. So me and my brother created a rotation system where I stay here one week and he'll stay the other. This week is my turn and I feel completely exhausted, unmotivated. It has been difficult getting out of bed so I feel like I can't help much around here if I also get depressed.

I feel completely confused and divided cuz I kinda agree with them and feel like I'm being selfish but at the same time can you ask this amount of commitment from someone who has an historical of mental illness? Who is almost finishing her graduate course and doesn't have any prospects for the future during a pandemic? It's just that I already feel lost and feel like I need to have a lot of self commitment to face my own insecurities and my insecurities regarding my future and with this problem adding up it really doesn't help.  I don't want to be depressed again, not after so many years of fighting. I know this family environment is not good for me, I mean, I already had problems and trauma with my parents (they were/are abusive parents and I feel much better if I get out of their house). The thing is, if I go, is there any way that things will be ok back there? What can my family do? I also don't want my mum to be exhausted because

I have improved a lot since but one thing I am struggling the most right now is this constant doubt that I may have a brain disorder. It was first bipolar then schizophrenia 2 months back. A few days back I saw something about autism on YouTube and then started doubting I may have a mild for of it. First I doubt about it and then research about it the whole day and constantly ruminate about it. This goes on for 2-3 days and then I just brush off the idea and become positive again only to stumble across a new disorder after a couple of weeks and start ruminating about it. 

The current one is ADHD and I have been watching videos about it since 2 days. I works like this. I read about a symptom and them my mind pops up a memory to prove that I have it even thought it makes no sense. For eg I read that people with ADHD are often forgetful and my mind is like ,""hey you forgot to take your wallet to college a few weeks back so you have this symptom"". I mean I don't want to do this but it feels like my brain just becomes very sensitive to everything and I can't help it. I can't concentrate on my work due to this.

1703,siamesing,1613661848,"When I was younger I used to just not really care about lockdown drills thinking of them as a way to get out of working for a bit, until last year when my school dealt with a gunman situation. Nobody was shot luckily enough but the guy was right outside our school carrying a gun coming inside. I was trapped under a desk for about 2 hours in the dark with no knowledge of what was going on really hearing footsteps in the hallway and police sirens outside. The guy was planning to shoot up the school. My school has had 3 incidents of planned/attempted shootings in about 4 years the other 2 being the year before I came. In the moment and a while afterwards I felt a lot of adrenalin and wasn't so scared but after it had calmed down what had happened hit me and I felt really sick and afraid.

Even though nobody was hurt I still suffered and suffer from a lot of anxiety around the incident, particularly some fear of the dark and claustrophobia in the classroom when I'm not near a close exit, and especially a lot of anxiety when we practice lockdown drills now. Even though I know it's a drill I can feel my heart pounding, I start shaking and my mouth gets really dry, and I get flashbacks to that day. When the teachers come around to bang on the doors and try and open the knobs I feel like crying.

Anyone experienced a similar event? Even though nothing really traumatic happened I still suffer from a lot of anxiety and thinking ""what if it happens again?"" I even had reoccuring nightmares for a while about being shot at by school shooters, I still get them occasionally but not as often as I used to.

I guess the drill today kind of just triggered another one of these panic episodes for me. I hope eventually I'll be able to feel 100% safe at school again, I just wish it would take a shorter amount of time.

I went a few months ago and she reassured me that they were normal and to come back in a year. But a few weeks ago I felt a small twinge near my left armpit and started to feel around. I thought I felt what seemed like a lump. I had my partner check and he said he was certain that there is no lump. I have been lifting weights lately and he said it just feels like muscle.

My left breast has always been a bit different from my right one (larger and more lumpy). My partner has since checked 6 times and every time he has told me that he feels nothing. He also reminds me that the location of my ""lump"" has changed several times since I first noticed it. I have spent hours and hours every day checking my breasts.

He now says: this is it. No more checking and no more reassurance. I know deep down that he is right, but I can't stop thinking about this all day long. I constantly feel like I need to check and feel anxious about not going to the doctor. My family is discouraging me from going because it is an obvious compulsion of mine and I go about every month. But the thought of leaving it is driving me crazy. My therapist recommended waiting a few months and then seeing how it feels. But the thought of waiting seems like torture too.

I’ve always been a worrier, an anxious person. Over the last few years of deaths and high stress jobs, it’s been too much for me to handle the anxiety and I starting taking medication. This really has felt like the best thing I’ve done for my health, like a break from my brain. No exercise, meditation, mindfulness exercises and self care help me the way that medication has. I thought I was over the whole “I need medication just to live a happy, healthy life” stigma in my head.

The Last couple months of being on the same dose, I started noticing brain fog and trouble concentrating, not being able to think of the right words, being tongue tied. Turns out I’ve had a delayed reaction to the medication. Ive always had trouble concentrating, losing things, breaking things, once I discussed this with my family doctor he made me do some questionnaires. He now thinks I’ve had untreated ADD my whole life. His recommendation was to try tapering off the current anxiety medication to see if it helped my current symptoms.

I went from 20mg to 15mg with little to no issues. This helped with the brain fog, so I decided to decrease more to see if it fully helped. Once I went to 10mg, my brain went into panic mode. I was beyond depressed, anxious, had very little resiliency, was angry for the smallest things, and was overall very sensitive. I haven’t felt this way since before the medication. I ended up increasing the medication back up to 15mg, and felt almost immediate relief.

I’m beating myself up for needing this medication just to feel like a sane, normal person. I either will be a calm and spacey person, or a less spacey person and an anxious mess for the rest of my life. For now I’ll take the former. The brain fog and ADD I can handle for now, so I’ll avoid medication for that.

I have a new manager and we haven’t seen eye to eye since he started. I put a lot of effort and care into my work. My manager is extremely detailed and in my view adds unnecessarily to our work load. He is hyper focused on reporting to senior management but doesn’t seem to appreciate the work that goes behind getting to the point where we can provide quality reporting i.e. what I do. I already work lots of late hours and am under constant pressure and stress. His criticism was that I make it very clear from my body language and tone when I think something is a waste of time and that I need to fix that. That is true, but I feel like it’s unfair and I’m not being appreciated for the work I actually do. He basically just wants me to get involved with more stuff i.e. his stuff which he deems the most important. But I’m also trying to balance doing my job well and maintaining my own personal mental health. I struggle with anxiety and depression quite badly, which nobody at work knows about. I think a lot of my identity is wrapped up in my work, which I know is not good but I can’t seem to break it. 

At a logical level I know it was intended as constructive criticism and I am an adult who should be  able to handle it. But I’d be lying if I said it hasn’t really affected me. I also feel really embarrassed because I was clearly affected by it and don’t think I did a good job of articulating myself in my response.

The event, the time, the exact location, what I felt and an over exaggerated idea of what everyone else thought. It’s driving me insane, ruminating is one thing, but for me, all the memories are in 4K and can  destroy my head space in like a second. My anxiety will actively aim to bring up every “bad” or bad thing that’s ever happened to me or everything that I did 24/7 and by the looks of it, it’s been second nature for my brain to store all these thoughts and memories for the past 15 years, so it’s not like I can turn it off. It seems that my brain is unable to filter out any information and just remembers things I don’t remotely care about. 
All my mistakes, awkward interactions, everything constantly being thrown at me. 
My mind has never been clear and I’ve only thought of death in regards to at least getting 1 minute of silence. 

I deleted contacts and erased the people who I truly knew weren’t my actual friends from my life, have moved to the other side of the country, removed myself from anyone’s social media pages.

I'm constantly worried of what others may be thinking of me, what my friends would make of my behavior in certain situations, how hard it is for me to function in a social setup and how I'd much rather be alone in whatever I do, not Bec I hate someone's involvement but because it makes me conscious to the extent that I can't work.

And with this realisation comes the sadness. GAD was already alot for me to handle, now to think that perhaps I may have social anxiety too and worry about handling that too.

Idk if this is a rant or not, but I'd much rather share something here and let it go completely unnoticed than talk it out with someone in my life.

TLDR Question: how do you get over a situation that causes you extreme anxiety but that you have to do repeatedly, multiple times a day?
 Long story but here we go... Some backstory: We have 2 dogs, and one is a rescue that is a runner that we're working on training but it's stubborn AF but other than that is so sweet and great. We're currently renting in an undesirable neighborhood and only have access to our front yard. Tonight I took her out for a potty break and she yanked the leash out of my hand and ran across the street to our neighbor. I ran right after her and the neighbor started belligerently yelling at me (she was intoxicated to the point that I could smell it on her). She had a small dog that my dog ran up to to play with and she FREAKED out. I apologized profusely as I ran after my dog, but nothing was getting through to her. Y'all I had to chase my dog a mile to get her back, In which she ran up to a cop because she loves strangers. 🤦‍♀️ When I got back to the house with her the lady was still yelling at my only good neighbor who walked out to try and help. She wouldn't leave us alone and came over our house to continue yelling at the top of her lungs at us. At this point she had woken up the whole neighborhood and we couldn't get her to calm down or talk to us normally, so after trying to talk with her we went inside and our neighbor continued yelling at her to try and get her to go home. I'm terrible with yelling and trying to reason with crazy people and my anxiety was a full blown panic attack at that point. Eventually someone called the cops because of the noise and they came and talked to us both. They met my dog (who literally wouldn't stop kissing the cops hand) and basically took our info and left. Since this happened though my anxiety is THROUGH THE ROOF. I'm anxious about taking my dog out and having her freak out at us again. I'm even more anxious about my dog ever escaping and finding her again. I can't sleep because I just have anxious dreams. Does anyone have any advice on how to A. Feel safe in my home again and safe taking my dog out and B. Help the anxiety of this subside? We're stuck in this house for at least 4 more months and I CANT WAIT to get out at this point. 😟",Anxiety,Getting through a situation that causes extreme anxiety...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lml7d6/getting_through_a_situation_that_causes_extreme/,1613620843.0

I leard about belly breathing after reading the book breathe and watching a few YouTube videos.

Since I read this I feel my breathing is all wrong and all i do is focus on it. I have never had any mental issues in the past but since I have read about this and began trying to do it, all I do is think about my breath to the point where I'm sick and can't sleep at night.

I went to a psychologist because I couldn't take it and it's taking a huge toil on my life, I don't really understand why I can't fixate on anything except my breath now.

I began with Pilates because of health issues and actually started to feel better in fact, and my teacher always actually says I have great breathing which is odd to me.

I don't really know what to and I feel mentally trapped. I've been sleeping about one to two hours a night, and for example. If I get up to pee I try to sleep again and then I concentrate on my breath and on the contrary end up increasing my heart rate instead of resting.

This is ruining my relationship with my wife and just need some help here. Of coarse I was subscribed xanax but it's the last thing j want to do. But I feel helpless and hopeless. I have been through pain physical, I've had slight tmj, tinnitus, and some other things but never have felt like this.

The only time I feel any better is when I talk about it with my wife/friends/family

I know if it's hard just don't do it, but my personality is if there's a better way I just have to do it. I am trying to go back to normal way and then I feel guilty that I'm breathing wrong and should be belly breathing. It's an all day constant mental struggle that I never expected to have.

I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I'm really scared, I'm afraid to go to bed, and as I said I really don't want to get addicted to medicine as the natural route such as yoga. Pilates, weight training is what I wanted to live by.

I have fixed many other things in my life, was a mouth breather, fixed my tongue position, but these are things you don't think about every second of the day.

I am not thinking about every single breathe, I'm really not sure what to do, I just want to be happy again, I'm willing to do anything.....

If anyone here can help, I really don't know

Has this happened to anyone else, to change someone's breathing has become something to cause me depression, depression I have never felt in my life. I was a very happy person, I dealt with pain before, but this is a mental hell.....

i’ve never posted in this sub before so i apologise if it isn’t the right place for this. 

basically i got really drunk with a friend during summer last year (covid restrictions had eased at this point and we were social distancing in my garden) and whenever i get drunk i tend to get really really anxious afterwards and convince myself that i did something awful. 

i asked my friend the next day if i’d done or said anything bad and she told me no, and we’ve spoken multiple times since and she’s been completely normal with me but i can’t stop thinking about the small possibility that i could have done something or said something really awful or inappropriate and i just don’t remember/haven’t been told. i know rationally this is just my anxiety talking and that i would know by now if anything had happened and that she wouldn’t continue speaking to me if i’d done anything bad but it’s really hard to get the anxious thoughts to stop.

first of all, a bit about myself. I am 24f and I have been struggling with depression and some anxieties (not extreme, mostly on social levels) for the last ten years. I am not in therapy yet but looking.

So there is this one thing I don't understand. Sometimes, I get those random waves of fear. Mostly when I am outside. Sometimes certain spots trigger the weirdest feeling in me. Sometimes it is out of nowhere. It's like fear, almost slight panic, and that weird feeling of ""this has happened before"". Like a Dejá vu. It lasts for a minute or so and then slowly fades away.  
I can't figure out what triggers it (it's not always on the same spots). It isn't regularely. Sometimes I have it every few days, sometimes not in weeks. It's so weird. I have had this for at least five years.

It's not really a big issue. It feels bad for a moment but doesn't affect me that much. But I would like to understand what this is? What could cause this? I have never had any real traumatic events in my life. So I don't know what could cause this.

Any ideas would be appreciated. I wish you all the best and that you are having a good day today.",Anxiety,Those random wave of fear and unknown feelings - what is that?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lmkq3f/those_random_wave_of_fear_and_unknown_feelings/,1613619071.0

1737,MorganSway,1613646130,"I just made the biggest move and decision of my life. Last week I packed my bags and moved half way across the world to teach in South Korea. This was a hard and easy decision to make. I say hard because I have a preexisting medical condition POTS, and at some points I thought this would be Impossible to accomplish.

Everything was going fine. I jumped on the plane, traveled 24+hrs and landed in Seoul. With Covid, there are increasing restrictions and with my medical condition its just icing on top of the cake. 

First, they need to check your temperature and make sure you don't have a fever. I'm surprised I passed. Next, after a day or two you need to get a COVID test. If you have covid they take you to a facility and monitor you. AFTER, when your 14day quarantine is over you go for a health test to make sure you're good and have no drugs. As you can see, there are a lot of steps, which I was already very anxious about. 

When I landed and arrived in my Airbnb everything was fine, until the day before my COVID test. I started experiencing shortness of breath, or air hunger. I would be sitting down and suddenly have the urge to breath deeply. I was never gasping for air, but felt an urge to breath. Like if I didn't I would suffocate, but I knew I was fine. This was the time I had ever experienced something like this.

Anxiety runs in my family, and I've always been a very very anxious person. Sometimes my anxiety stops me from doing things. My palms sweat, heart races and I get dizzy. However, shortness of breath is an entirely new symptom.

I got my results back (negative) and my SOB has gradually gotten better. At first I thought it was covid and they detect it, which can happen. However, after a quick Google I found out if your only symptom is SOB the probability of it being Covid is extremely low. I forgot to mention I'm also a little bit of a hypochondriac.  

Next, I thought it might be the pollution. The air quality in Seoul has been terrible the last few days, in the red zone. I wore a mask indoors but it didn't really seems to help. After, I thought maybe it's allergies or I have a chest cold. My nose is blocked and I do have mucus in my throat. It's possible, but it seems unlikely. I can still breath out of my nose, but with a little difficulty

I remembered that I'm also anemic, and one of the signs for low iron is shortness of breath. I started taking my iron pills again, but this has never been a symptom for me. Finally it thought it might be my beta blockers that are lowering my blood pressure too much. 

Just writing this is making me realise how crazy I sound. I worry about the smallest thing and try to find solutions.  I realised what all these conclusions has in common, anxiety over having Covid and failing my medical exam. Not to mention, fear of not being able to teach properly due to my condition

As I mentioned, I never had shortness of breath due to anxiety before. This is a first for me. When I'm not thinking about breathing, it's better for a little bit. But as soon I wonder about it, bam! I need to breath in. I've also been constantly yawning. 

I found a post on this sub about deep breath exercises and how they help. I gave it shot earlier and it seems to have helped calm me down a little. My breathing is better, but I'm still having some issues about it. Not to mention, my HR has also been higher than normal today. 

This wasn't an easy decision to make, and now with my short as of breath I have more anxiety over that. I'm very frustrated and angry at myself. I know this is something that I can't necessarily control, but it makes me feel ashamed and disappointment that I've gotten this far, only to be pulled back by something like this. It just adds onto my stress of teaching which I'm really excited to try. I've always wanted to teach ESL, this wasn't a random decision.

1761,wow_a_great_name,1613637109,"Idk if flair meant relationship as romantic or in general, but I see my friends as family anyways haha. 

I haven't chatted with my friends as frequently as I used to and at first I got nervous over how they think of me as an uncaring friend, but I talked to them about it and they were supportive about it as long as they know I'm alright. So I breathed easy and continued doing my usual routine and stuff. Today's my eldest best friend's birthday and I wanted to greet her but my brain kept sending thoughts of her and everyone else hating me for not being there for them and calling me a backstabber, even though I haven't done anything wrong to them and talked to no one but them and my family for months so it doesn't make sense.

I kept pushing myself to just ignore those thoughts, go the chat and say my wishes. Easy as pie. And I finally did it, pretty late in the day but still done it. At first, no one replied, and immediately my brain pulled no punches creating scenarios of my friends talking to each other behind my back, conspiring over what they should do to me to get back at me for being a lazy friend and stuff. Sounds weird yeah but it's horrifying to me and my chest started to tighten, breathing shallow. Then finally, my best friend texted me about us having a group call to celebrate later, apparently she doesn't have strong signal at a mall she's currently at and the rest were just offline. We talked a bit after that and I told her I want to treat them all when we meet up soon since we haven't met in person for a year and I just want to do a good deed for them. She got really excited and said she couldn't wait, and I'm just so happy it didn't turn out the way my brain told me it would: that she'd just say ""k"" and ghost me forever, then tell the others about it and they'd ghost me forever too lmao. 

Sorry for long post, just really want to put it out there.

I wanted to ask if anyone else feels the same way. 
Most of the time when I get anxious because of something I know deep inside that I shouldn’t be worried. 
It’s like my irrational self voice is my anxiety but I also habe the rational self voice in my head that tells me
I am ok. 
Like I’m afraid that this mole is maybe skincancer and I get super worried but I have this rational voice in my head that’s like: you had a skin cancer screening, it is fine, it’s probably nothing.

I was sitting at my desk doing school work and near my left shoulder blade I started to feel a stinging sensation. I thought I got bit or stung by a bug. I didn't find a bug and the pain kept happening randomly. Well I thought hmm maybe if I smoke (mj) I can relax. I was already feel a little nervous because everything w/ covid and not really sure what was gonna happen or what to expect. Well I never smoke and turns out when you've been reading doom and gloom all over the internet that turns into a full blown panic attack. I literally thought I was having a heart attack. Well I made it through that night. Over the next few days and weeks more stuff would happen throughout the day. During the night I would get leg pain and not pain that I've felt before(cramps) but like little stings on my legs and bottoms of my feet. I started waking up and my hands and feet would be tingling. So obviously my anxiety atleast i think was getting worse ( I have never dealt with anxiety before this) I was having a hard time sleeping and getting so panicked I would stay up all night and get like cold sweats where my teeth would chatter. One night I went to pick something off the ground and my whole left arm went numb all the way down to my fingers it felt like my arm was swollen even around up my chest. I ended up doing teledoc. He said it could just be a pinched nerve to let it rest and prescribed ibuprofen. I never seemed to heal which I always been healthy so this was unusual. I finally got in to see a doctor and she started me with PT and sent me to do an xray on my neck to check for a pinched nerve. Xray came back normal and I did PT for over 2 months weekly. I eventually stopped because I felt a little better and the Pt and I both thought I could just do the exercises at home and would heal.I eventually started getting dizzy and headaches and tinnitus so my doctor sent me in to get a CT scan of my brain. Everything came back normal so I just carried on. I never fully healed but I was able to manage my pain over the summer doing yoga, going for walks and my pt exercises.  I just hoped it was bad posture. I'm on my phone a lot. End of November I  was sitting at my computer and pressure from back goes up the back of my neck all the way into my face. It felt like I was hanging upside down. Pressure in my head and face continued for weeks. So my doctor sent me to get an mri of my spine. Again everything came back normal. My doctor referred me to a neurologist. So far I have done blood work, eeg, and mri of brain. All have came back normal. I will be doing an emg on the 3rd. I still get the pain by my shoulder and pressure in my head. My feet and legs have been tingling. I have tinnitus. Im still getting dizzy.

I have all of these great ideas for things I want to do but my anxiety just completely stops me from acting on any of them and as a result it feels nearly impossible to reach my potential.

I'm curious how many other people feel this way. It really does seem like there are a lot of great talents and ideas that go to waste because of crippling anxiety. We live in a world that is completely toxic to anyone's mental well-being and creativity and as a result many great ideas go out the window because just about everyone uses up all their mental energy trying to hold it together. This definitely is an apt description of my story and I suspect it sums up many other people's stories on here as well.

What are some of your great ideas that you have thought of that your anxiety has prevented you from acting on? This is a place free from judgement where I will not hide behind the guise of ""realism"" like some slimy corporate boss and give a pessimistic take about why your idea sucks or isn't realistic or viable or whatever.

We just started dating literally a week ago. So trust me I am fully aware this sounds fast and crazy, but just bear with me and read on before assuming anything. You may be more suprised then you expect (sorry for the dramatic dialogue, ya gurl just watched the Cruella trailer and literally is obsessed)

But essentially, we just met recently under wild circumstances and we never even meant to date. Our first hangout turned into a date just naturally. And over the next few days we got to know each other more and more, and felt a connection that was unmatched by anything ive ever felt in my life. We grew closer and closer, telling each other things weve both never told anyone. 

On valentines day, I decided to face my anxiety (i made a post about this on vday) and get him flowers, and a teddy bear. And he loved it, and we decided to get a hotel room. Here is where it clicked to me that this may not be infatuation, but something truly rare and special. What did we do in that hotel room for the night? *Absolutely nothing sexual*. We solely stayed up all night, drinking, enjoying each other and talking about our past, our fears, what we love, what we dont, our families, our traumas, our anxieties, all of that. It was amazing, and so deeply emotional. We went to bed and cuddled all night. He told me he wouldnt be able to sleep if we cuddled cus he gets too hot, but we tried and within 30 seconds he passed out cus he felt so comfortable with me. 

Flash forward to now, we have already had our first arguement and what happened? *We solved it by being fully open, honest and communicative*. Thats a rarity these days, we both prioritized genuine trust and communication and solved it within 30 minutes or so and moved on right away. 

Hes seen me in bad moods, upset, and mad. Ive seen him in the same situations and we both embrace it. We embrace the bad times knowing how strong the good ones have already been.  We ride the wave of ups and downs together without trying to change the other person in any way.

Today he texted me and said I needed to come over immediately cus he had to tell me something important. I get there, and he gets in my car and i see him smiling and giggling a little and i go ""oh my god you got a job offer"" and he said nahh and so i was like ""you got a new apartment"" and he says no. And he tells me then that he knows this may be fast, but he feels like hes starting to fall in love with me and even if its fast, he feels fully comfortable with that. And so he started to get a little anxious waiting for my response, and i then cut him off and go ""i feel the exact same way 100%"" and immediately pull into the nearest parking lot and make out with him. Funniest thing is then he goes ""you realize were in a highschool parking lot right""😂😂😂😂😂 I was so in the moment i didnt even realize that. 
 
In the gay community I feel as though all of this is so rare. Often times gay men insist on having sex on the first date, and we fully have set boundaries on how we want to establish emotional intimacy before sexual intimacy. And i feel as though it is rare to find someone who communicates with you so well and works to solve hardships healthily with the intention of growth rather then winning. We listen to each other to leanr and grow, not to win.

And lastly, the thing that really made me realize how special this is, is that whenever I am around him, my anxiety vanishes and I feel completely grounded and calm with him.",Anxiety,"Something incredible, something rare, has just happened",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lmev70/something_incredible_something_rare_has_just/,1613597711.0

Well, I graduated highschool five years ago and have had 2-3 jobs every year because I get extreme panic attacks, paranoia, and unpredictable episodes. For example, I’ll be going to work, perfectly okay, then out of nowhere, I get hit with a panic attack with only 5 minutes until my shift starts so I’m left with the only options being: going into work with my ugly panic attack face, have everyone make a big deal out of it and become very anxious that others are seeing me like this and pointing it out, or just no show and get fired. All my work places also do not allow for calling out because its shift work and you have to be there for your shift or find a cover, but no one ever wants to cover and these episodes aren’t predictable so I cant find someone to cover within 5 minutes of my shift. 

I go to therapy, see psychiatrists, on medication and nothing works in the aspect of going to work normally.

Tonight after practice (where there were 7 other girls) I overheard another mom talking to the coach about separating her child from another and the coach responded that yes, she separated them and her child did better. They do a lot of partner work, my child is often partners with her and tonight they weren't. Now, I have no idea who they were talking about but my mind immediately went to ""She doesn't want her kid working with like because mine isn't good at dance and is holding her kid back"". Which led to ""Omg, we should quit dance. I can't come back next week with this mom."" 😭😭😭

As I was going down the driveway, I was feeling proud of myself for actually leaving the house at a reasonable time and not be late for something for once. But right when I was rounding the turn the mail truck was coming at me from the other direction. We both tried to stop but the road was icy and we crashed. So instead of going to my doc appointment I had to take care of this. I had to call to reschedule so now I’ll have to be worried for another 2 weeks. Also, my car is not drivable for now and I don’t know if they’ll be able to fix it.

I’ve been recently posting on subreddits dedicated to matching individuals with certain kinks or fetishes together. I got a couple hits and made a couple real connections by posting personal ads in the past. A few weeks ago, a woman claiming to be a sugar momma said she was infatuated with my post, and that she would love to be in a long distance relationship with me. Of course, being lonely, horny and desperate i took her up on this offer, we talked and swapped pics for a few days until she started talking about spoiling me. She told me that in order for her to send me my first allowance, she would need me to send a tribute fee to prove my dedication and seriousness about this relationship. Blinded by love and attention, something I feel is mostly missing from my regular life ( I’ve been quite depressed), I sent her some money over cashapp. For whatever reason, she said that I sent the money to the wrong account. I immediately attempted to refund the transaction but it was too late, luckily my bank was able to recharge the transaction. Next we had a long discussion a few days later about cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin wallets. I had told her it was something I was interested in and she said she was familiar with it. She had me sign up for the trading app called CEX.io. After creating my account and everything, I added 450$ in funds to my account. She said she wanted to teach me how the app functions and she mentioned the previous tribute fee that was not successful. Bottom line, after she manipulated my emotions and even sent me nude pics, (which btw I think are legit considering I couldn’t reverse image search them) I sent her the 450$ in Bitcoin. I’m young and stupid and made a mistake. Maybe u will call me rude names in the comments, just know that I’ve been out of work for a long time to mental illness brought on by covid and that money meant a lot to me. I definitely fucked up big time, I’m sitting here grieving the money thinking about how much I can’t stand the sight of myself, sometimes I wish I had just ended it all a long time ago so that I wouldn’t have to feel more pain like this did to me. Not really 100% sure how to end this, after doing some research I found out this is a pretty common scam, live and learn I guess.

Last semester quite literally destroyed me. Calc and chem at the same time sucked (mainly just calc in general), but I ended up with an A in calc and an A- in chem. But getting those grades also made me lose about 12 pounds (I was only 130 to begin with), I lost so much hair from not eating, I got dumped my by boyfriend since I ""stress out too much"", and I upset a lot of people close to me since I spent so much time complaining about things that in reality aren't even that bad. I should be grateful I even have the privilege to go to school, yet I spend most of my time crying about ""having"" to do it. 

I told myself I would do better this semester. Up until yesterday I have. I haven't thrown up before any tests like I used to. But I just got out of a midterm that I do not think I did too well on, and the spiral of worst case scenarios starts. A lot of it is due to the pressure of dental school, but a lot is also due to making my dad proud. He's done nothing to pressure me into doing well, but he's given me so much in regards to life and paying for college I feel so guilty if I don't get all As. 

My problem is mainly my mindset. I'm not ready to have the same semester I had last time, and I'm scared of who I'll upset for being like this.

Transference: For as long as I can remember I have always had a borderline obsessive crush on someone in all phases of my life. Generally someone who is completely unattainable and I know full well no urges will be acted upon. However it’s seems that I focus on the subtle flirting and feeling of being wanted because it allows me to focus my emotional energy on a good feeling rather than my anxiety. I seem to throw myself into the crush for the sole purpose of the distraction it provides me so that I don’t get sucked up into my anxiety.


Dissociation: I have also realized that I tend to keep myself in a state dissociation as a coping mechanism. It’s like I keep emotional distance from of all my accomplishments and big moments in my life so that I don’t have to feel the weight of reality. It is as if dissociating is my way of slowing down time in between stress inducing events. The problem with dissociating is that I don’t seem to feel the elation that comes with accomplishing things. And sometimes I don’t feel like I’m living my life to the fullest.

I’ve hit a realization that my job isn’t for me. It’s a wonderful place and the people are great. It doesn’t make me feel purposeful and honestly, brings me more anxiety than I need it to. So tonight (10 mins ago actually) I was on an evening Zoom call with the team and some youth leaders in the org &amp; it just hit me - I don’t want to be here. I posted a message to try and force myself to be part of the group but it seemed to be overlooked and it just cemented this feeling of uselessness. My heart started racing and I just felt like running (figuratively and literally). It wasn’t quite a panic attack or major anxiety I feel when I have to wake up and actually start work in the morning BUT it was a weird offshoot of those feelings. 

So I turned off my camera, waited a few seconds, and left the room. Then I messaged my boss on Slack and told her I got a phone call I needed to take and I would try to go back on the call before it ended. I never got a response but didn’t care and got straight into the shower. I just don’t care. 

Is anyone else’s anxiety turning them into someone who is willing to do things like this to get out of situations?

I was wondering if anyone could share some helpful tips for dealing with death anxiety. My boyfriend of 2 years deals with death anxiety on a daily basis. He does see a counselor every 2-3 weeks however he still has moments that worry me and I feel helpless as I don't always know what to do.  

I always tell him he can talk to me, I will always listen without judgement, I just find it hard to suggest helpful ideas in response. He talks a lot about the fear of losing what is currently happening, and the fact that this will all be over soon. He isn't so much afraid of the experience of death, in fact it seems he looks forward to it, I think it's more about how and when it will happen. 

Most days he needs distraction from daily tasks in order to avoid his anxiety building - sometimes he has to leave the bed/sleep because his mind is plunging into the thoughts - and his phone seems to be a good distraction from this. He also told me that the main reason he doesn't want to die is because of me. But I don't want his reason for living to be me, because he has so many other important things and people in his life. 

It seems the day of and the day after his counselling session, he is able to deal with the anxious thoughts and get on with things, but over a few more days it builds up. We always talk about the helpful information he's heard, just so it can be reiterated and he is reminded of it - such as the fact that this is normal and it will pass, its not the be all end all, focus on today, ect.

At least once a day, I am in a bad situation with my therapist where I missed too many appointments to be able to keep going for a period of two months.

as I guess suspension / time out period.....I did not aim to get into that mess at all and feel really ashamed that I did in the first place....
I just have a lot of issues with my physical health. I am going to Urologist, a GI doctor, an Allergist, a dietitian, a neurologist, and now they want me to go to another department, a pain management !
so what basically happened was I trying to balance all of that out and looking for work, as well as going back to school for pre-nursing......
and some days things end up overlapping or I just forget! and thats what ended up happening...and I totally own up to that..I know that I am responsible for making to my therapy sessions. I just also have a TON of other things I am trying to manage right now.

as if that wasn't bad enough I also got into a car accident probably over three weeks ago now...but it was highly stressful for me and traumatic for me. Not to mention its huge pain to have to rely and ask my retired mother to help with getting me around to the places that I need to go to. Like work, or my ever so lovely long list of DRs visits.

But we both are trying to shop....for a new vehicle for me.

1852,MariachiBandMonday,1613610403,"My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) have been dating for a little over a year and have moved into our first apartment together a few days ago. While we're not completely set up yet, we're slowly working through it.

We are understandably not in the jolliest of moods. I'm still getting used to not living with my mother for the first time since the college dorm days, and this is my boyfriend's first time living on his own as well. Important furniture still hasn't arrived, we're both working from home... but I think despite it all, I'm adjusting a little better than I thought I would. I'm so-so.

I'm worried about how my boyfriend is adjusting. I'm surprised actually, because he's more independent than I am; despite living with his parents, he was doing most things for himself anyway (laundry, food shopping, cooking, etc), so I figured by having our own place, he would have slid into the routine easier. But it's the opposite.

He's barely eaten anything since we arrived, has been withdrawn from me, and has no energy because he hasn't been sleeping well (part of it is my fault--apparently, I snore and never knew). When I asked him if he was okay, he told me it's just anxiety and he needs time to adjust, but it still didn't sit right with me. He's been spending a lot of time alone and his whole demeanor is just *stiff.* I mean, he's not an energetic person to begin with, but even trying to give him a hug today--stiff as a board. I'm giving him his space right now since that's what his body language is telling me he wants, but it's kind of making me feel rejected. I'm probably selfish for even thinking that way. And while he's always had anxiety, I feel like it's spiraling at the time we need each other most.

Yes, I realize it's only been a few days and I should be patient, but is this kind of anxiety normal with moving?

I have been doing some thinking today and I wanted to check in with some like-minded people to get their opinion. to start off, I am a 20-year-old female who has been struggling with anxiety and OCD symptoms for a lot of my life (especially after my dad died when I was 9). as I have grown older I have come to realize that my home environment is quite toxic (fighting, a lack of emotional support, hoarding, mess, untreated mentally ill siblings, etc.). I am transferring to university this fall and will be moving in with my boyfriend across the country in a week and a half until the summertime. once summer is over, hopefully, I am out of this house for good.

now, I started taking Lexapro in December of this past year. I have gained a lot of weight, but I have been able to mellow out a bit. I recently heard a quote that has continued to pop up in my mind ""People go to therapy to deal with people who *should* be in therapy."" and I am starting to think that that is the sort of situation I am in. my sister deals with a variety of mental health issues and is oftentimes a terrible person to be around (I don't mean to sound insensitive, but if you have a family member who refuses to take responsibility for the actions caused by their mental illnesses you probably understand) and my mom has been emotionally absent for a lot of my life since my dad died. I notice most of my anxiety symptoms occur when I am home with my family - when I hear them yell, when I notice a big mess, etc. I am considering quitting Lexapro and I am wondering if it will be unnecessary once I am out of this terrible environment. has anyone gone through something like this by any chance?",Anxiety,could my anxiety be environmental?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lm9jov/could_my_anxiety_be_environmental/,1613580663.0

He ate this vegetarian meat replacement earlier and thinks it’s that (I didn’t have any) but I’m still really freaking out that it’s a bug and I’m going to catch it. I also feel so selfish that my partner is feeling unwell and my first thought it completely self-centred and selfish. 

I read the packet and there’s nothing weird in it so I don’t know why that’d make him sick but it could just be that it didn’t agree with him but I’m just really really panicked that it’s a sickness that I’ll catch.

I have an apartment that's only meant for students so I'm kind of just waiting until something happens because I don't know what to do.  

I don't have hopes of making friends because I'm very quiet and not good at talking. For example I joined an online community recently with really friendly people but I have ended up saying nothing and just reading other people's conversations.

She's not on Reddit and neither is her boyfriend, so I'm not really concerned enough to use a throwaway account. For background info, we're all friends-or were, at first. My husband has had a friend for at least 10 years (we'll call him Jacob) and they grew up together. Jacob has a girlfriend (we'll call her Nicole) and they've been together for as long as my husband and I have. Jacob doesn't want to marry her because he doesn't believe in marriage.   
Anyway..   
My husband and Jacob thought renting an apartment together would be a great idea, since they work in the same town and it would cut down on gas. Good idea, right?  
Here's the kicker- Jacob, my husband, and myself are the only ones employed. Nicole just got her license at the ripe old age of 23 and has no car, no job, and was previously living with her parents. She doesn't contribute to rent in any way. Because of some agreement my husband made with Jacob, we were paying 2/3 rent up until January. Now, Jacob pays for his and Nicole's portion.   


I used to go to the gym with Nicole. Five or six times, and always picked her up since we lived nearby to her and her parents. We started talking after meeting through our partners. I saw her as sort of a friend, but quickly realized that our personalities are quite opposite.   


She does things that drive me insane. I've started writing in a journal.

Things like..  


* Hogging the TV in the living room. The couch is her throne for all daylight hours.  

* Spilling coffee and food on my $80 rug and making no real attempt to get it out.
* Complaining about my husband's dishes in his office when she lets hers pile high in the sink.
* Being overly sensitive to any and everything, asking questions she already knows the answer to.
* Using a high-pitched whiny voice to try and manipulate one of us into doing something for her.
* Butting into conversations she isn't a part of.
* Inviting her parents over and never telling any of us when they're coming.
* Constantly trying to talk to to me when I come home from work. I work 2 jobs.
* Being rude.
* Leaving her crap out like she owns the place. Perfume bottles, coffee mugs, used tissues.
* Knocking on doors then immediately sticking her head in/walking in. Oh, and she doesn't know when to stop talking.  
 I do everything in my power to not ignore her, but some days my anxiety takes over and I just feel the need to hide in my room where she isn't. I try to be polite, make conversation, etc., and make sure my body language doesn't show I'm uncomfortable..   
Once she pulled me in her room to ""talk"" and started bawling about how she ""has anxiety too""-she's the least anxious person I've ever met, and Jacob has talked to me about that. She uses her ""mental illnesses"" as a crutch but she's a perfectly normal, functioning person and makes me feel like MY anxiety and depression is ""nothing"" compared to what ""she goes through.""  
She said she feels like I hate her and that she annoys me. Both of those are true to an extent. But I lied and said I didn't hate being around her. However, I did say that my type of anxiety requires me to be alone and recharge, and I like being alone most of the time. We worked it out, this was like a month ago.. but still.   
I'm sure that I'm going all over the place with this, but let me get right to the point. She makes me feel stressed out. My hair has been falling out after any time I've gotten really overwhelmed. I can't cut through the living room, to go to the kitchen without her asking me 1000 questions.   
I can't talk with her about this stuff because she'll be overly dramatic and cut me off, constantly.

I wanna make songs but I don’t have the computer to do it. I can’t even make good riffs on guitar yet so I get mad and don’t have as much fun with it because I skip to much instead of practicing.

Ive been taking zoloft for about 2 years now, 100mg. It works great except that i have trouble with orgasm during sex.

Recently i got my ADD diagnosis and a couple of days ago i was meeting the doctors to start taking concerta. I mentioned my orgasm problem and i got prescribed Buspirone to take when needed cause its suppoused to help with the orgasm issue. And i also got inderal because of my light tremors.

I looked up buspirone on my countries medicine info site thingy and im so confused. It says its a long term med, that i should take it everyday like i do my ssri. But that i shouldnt take it if i already take ssri or ADD meds. And also that its illegal for people under 18?

1883,DildoBaggins0180,1613602050,"I've always had a little anxiety. I remember being in elementary school and convinced myself I was going to die from chewing on my pencil and swallowing lead. In high school I developed anxiety about having to go to the bathroom during times when I wasnt able to, like traveling or in class. After college I managed to enlist in the US Army where my bathroom phobia reared its ugly head again. Especially since I was diagnosed with IBS diarrhea so basically I always had diarrhea. But there was no getting out of it I was in the Army and soon I was in Iraq. Either riding around in a APC or doing 8 hour foot patrols. I ended up completing 10 years and thought all my anxiety was behind me, no more triggers. Well late one night I start having heart palpitations, woke me out of a sound sleep with a heart rate of over 200. Turned out benign but started a sever health anxiety. I slowly started worrying about dying from a heart problem. I have high blood pressure and my father had his 1st heart attack at 46. I'm 42 now it could happen to me my mind keeps telling me. So now I have full blown debilitating panic attacks. Ended up in the ER a few times. I've been on and off meds my whole adult life believing the issue was temporary. Now I see it's not and my life is being ruined by it. I developed a fear of elevators because they might get stuck. I cant take stairs because what if it brings on a heart attack. I dont like being alone because what if I need to go to the ER. yes I need to see a Dr, my family dr decided to move to Canada now I'm lost in the shuffle getting dr's thru the VA. Went to VA mental health clinic as a walk in yesterday. Gave me prescription for Lorazepam and Trintellix. Trintelix I'd been on before that's why they wrote that one again but insurance is fighting it because its expensive. 72 hours to see if I can get the prescription and 25 days till I see a Dr. I hate lorazepam, seems to work but not very long and takes forever to kick in.

1884,EvanPennington96,1613601693,"It took my a while to decide which sub reddit to post this in, that being r/gaming, r/anxiety, or r/sex. 

Basically anytime my mind perceives a visually stimulating situation ( Playing CSGO Tracking heads with a cross hair, or Having sex Staring at my girlfriend's ass) my Nervous system goes high intensity mode, My heart rate and breathing become extremely stressed much more than regular. 



For example if I hop into discord with my buds, When I join I'm relatively relaxed and conversate a bit, Someone mentions an fps game so naturally we all hop on to play. Within 10-15 minutes of playing I'm no longer the same person. I barely conversate and my breathing feels labored. Its really getting to me because it's affecting my enjoyment of the game and ability to just speak to friends while gaming, and it's even carrying over into insomnia at night. Which makes me much more prone and sensitive to these the next day 



Another huge thing is I can masturbate perfectly fine easy breathing no palpitations and the orgasm is fantastic, But if I masturbate to porn or have sex with my gf it's the same situation it seems like adrenaline and I cum much quicker, The orgasm is WAY less satisfying whenever it's like this. Sadly everytime my girlfriend and I  have sex. 



Why is it that as soon as my mind perceives a visually stimulating situation my whole nervous system just goes high intensity mode and how can I learn to change this. I've tried deep breathing while and beforehand for both gaming and sex and it barely seems to help. 



I know the simple answer would be to quit video games, And probably get into an exercise schedule but I have gamed my entire life. It's a huge part of my life and I'd like to retrain myself to be even be able to fall asleep while I game( hasn't happened in over a decade)

Yesterday I woke up early at 8 am, showered, shaved, and wore my best clothes. I opened by laptop and logged into the career fair, and then sat there for a few hours. It was just a cycle of staring at the ""join queue"" button, reading over my resume, pacing around my room, looking at the job description again and again. I did that for four hours until I had to attend a lecture, and the career fair ended.

Then today, I had another chance. I woke up at 8, made myself look my best and logged in. The exact same cycle. I even started reading articles on why career fairs aren't effective to try and justify it. I smoked some CBD, I watched motivational videos all just to make me press the ""Join Queue"" button. 

Finally, on the fifth hour, I somehow gathered the courage to press the button for my top company choice. Now I would be lying if I said I didn't completely butcher the meeting.

1898,NotASynthPromise,1613597992,"Hello, as the title says I've been battling some relationship anxiety, mainly since this is my first relationship, and actually my first close female friend. Essentially it's nothing she's done, it's just how I'm thinking about it.

Here's the context:

I met this girl (I'll call her Jen) through school a few months back and we became pretty good friends. We have a lot in common, especially in personality/sense of humor/mindsets. I asked Jen out two weeks after we met (which was too early I now realize), and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship yet (because of COVID and adjusting to being back at school). Luckily, it didn't make anything weird and we became closer friends over the next few months.

In early December Jen asked me out, which came out of nowhere to me. It took about a month to finally go out due to COVID scares in each of our families, but we've been dating for about a month and a half now. It's been going decently well I think, and we've both shared that we're having fun and like hanging out with each other.

But I have anxiety (diagnosed, and I'm currently doing therapy), which I found out over a fun week during quarantine last summer. It's been making it tough to figure out where I should be in the relationship, what I should do, and how she's feeling about all this. I know that since I'm the guy I'll have to be the one initiating many of the things (first kiss, etc.), and that's made it even more difficult.

About 3-4 weeks into dating we were watching a show and laughing and having a good time at her place. We said something like we both appreciate each other and jokingly high-fived and I said how funny it was that we just high fived and I asked if I could kiss her. Looking back it really wasn't the best timing and made it a little awkward. She was cool with it though and understood, and said I didn't need to ask.

I tried to actually initiate a first kiss about 5 weeks after we started dating (at the end of the day as a goodnight kinda thing), but she was caught off guard and said she wasn't ready for that step yet. So I guess I have to figure out when she will be? Of course I'm not mad there, it's just my anxiety creeping in. And to be fair to her, it probably wasn't the best time to do that (we were hanging out and watching shows).

That's made it difficult to figure out where we are in our relationship and what I should be doing, and when, to keep it going. I'm really, really bad at taking hints, like blind as a bat, even though I really do try. I don't want to seem like I don't care, and I don't want to seem desperate/rushing. She said her ex was like that and that's why she was afraid to take the next step a few weeks ago.

A few days after that (so like last week), she leaned up next to me on the couch while watching a show. My brain was pretty much in this mode when that happened, and it took me a few seconds to even lean into her a bit. I was thinking of putting my arm around her, but figured if she wasn't ready to kiss a week ago that it would be pretty weird to take a similar step now.

We've talked about my anxiety a few weeks back, but I obviously didn't mention anything I said above because I don't want it to come off like I'm blaming her, or wanting her to do all the work. I'm honestly wondering if I should talk to her about this, but then again I definitely don't want to come off as pushing blame onto her or just throwing my emotions at her.

I can't get it out of my head, I honestly don't think I've had a solid hour without thinking about her or what to do since late January. I keep feeling like I'm screwing it up by taking it too slow and not seeming like I care (like before I tried to kiss her), or taking it too fast (like after I tried to kiss her). It's making it so tough to actually enjoy dating.

So, what should I do? Am I just overthinking all of this? Should I bring it up to her in any way, even semi-redacted?

I'm thinking of being straight-up with her about this. Obviously I wouldn't include all the emotional details, but just a general overview of how I've been, and reiterating that it's not her fault. Should I do this, and how should I approach/phrase it?

She's a really cool person and I really like her, and don't want to screw this up. I haven't had any girl I've bonded with as well as I do with her.

I want my own apartment and no more living with roommates or friends. I’ve been serving at the same restaurant for almost 5 years and I’m done. I also suffer from major anxiety and in addition to this, change terrifies me. I’ve been looking into being a leasing a consultant because I used to be one for a short time. However, I don’t want to do the 9-6 schedule. I’ve done it before and it’s exhausting and doesn’t leave much time for other stuff. I know beggars can’t be choosers, and that’s my problem. I’m so worried to step out of my comfort zone so that I can have a nice job with benefits and also be able to finally have my OWN apartment. But my fears keep holding me back no matter how much I want these things. It’s so hard to get over but just thinking about trying to take these next steps is emotionally exhausting for me. I just want to finally start my life independently but I’m so terrified. The more I think about doing these things and going about these changes, the more I just want to curl up into a ball and lay in bed all day, which then in return gives me more depression and anxiety for feeling like I’m doing nothing with my life.

Hi guys,

So recently I’ve been having intrusive thoughts about almost anything and everything. My fear is psychosis so it causes me to latch onto the fear of it and relating all my thoughts to them.

This evening I was sitting with my girlfriend and her mum and we were talking about random things and I did not once think of my thoughts or wonder and question everything that happens in front of me. My thoughts have been surrounded by horrible anxiety and knots in my stomach.

What if my food is poisoned 

What if I start to believe my thoughts

What if the government are after me/anyone for that matter

What if I think the tv/radio is talking to me

What if everything is real or what if there is things in the world that I control.

Absolutely none of these thoughts I believe. I seemed to have conditioned my thoughts into relating them to all be “what if” thoughts then I question everything and anything. Even things i see or do I question it. I’m starting to get a tad angry at it tbh. My psychologist said it’s certainly not schizophrenia or anything like that it’s more of obsessive thinking. I honestly obsess over all my thoughts and feelings which makes me think I’m going insane and crazy. It’s a horrible feeling and I just feel like I can’t enjoy anything I do just now. Always wondering what people think of me and if they like me. What if people are looking at me or talking about me. I know that they aren’t but my thoughts latch onto the fact of “what if”.

Has anyone else ever had these type of thoughts like constant throughout the day no matter what you think about or anything like that.

1921,VinesNFluff,1613592038,"I have a roommate. His name is Kevin. He is the worst possible roommate ever. 

We've been living together for as long as I can remember. When Kevin moved in, I was a teenage boy. And at first, he was just another person I had to live with. Quiet and polite, even if a bit of a doomer. We barely spoke.

Slowly, though, as we became more familiar, he became bolder. 

Kevin believes every conspiracy theory and makes some up himself. Then tells them to me. And the worst part is, we've been stuck together for long enough, sometimes I believe his weird ideas. Still even when I don't, it tends to ruin my day anyway.

Mild body pains? It's fine. I went working out yesterday. I'm fat and out of shape. Of course my body hurts. Kevin hears me and says it's probably Dengue Fever of H1N1 or some other deadly illness that causes body pains.

Parents asked -- Not too rudely -- How my studies for the government job exam are going? Kevin hears about it and tells me in no uncertain terms that they know I've been slacking off and are coming to ground me like they did when I was a little kid and they were typical strict parents. As if 29 year old men get grounded.

Boyfriend doesn't respond? He's working, of course. Give 'im time. Kevin tells me he is seeing someone else and I should break up to avoid heartbreak.

When he _can't_ find something in my own life to make me miserable, he'll just bring up random stuff about the state of the world itself, and how fucked we are.

I try to ask what is wrong with him that he keeps coming up with all those doom scenarios for our lives, instead of just letting things happen and dealing with them as they come. I ask why he worries about the state of the world at large when we're from a privileged background and even if we weren't, all those things are so distant and outside his control or mine, that worrying about it before it happens is just making our own days worse for no reason. He tells me he ""Just is like that"" and that ""he ain't happy about it either"".


Ever since lockdown started I have no escape from Kevin. It used to be that when working on my internship or at lectures in Uni, I'd be away from him and could be fine. Now, I get at most 2 hours a week that I'm _not_ alone with him, and I can't even escape it because I am immunocompromised due to IBS.

I'm sitting here arguing with strangers on Reddit because at least when I'm doing that, these scary emotions come from someone I can block when it gets too bad. Fighting with strangers, oddly, grounds me. Reminds me that there are other humans around. I should be studying, these public exams for government jobs aren't easy! But I _can't_. The silence of studying makes me start _thinking_ like him.

Kevin scares me. He tells me he could kill me if he wanted to and he is crazy enough that I believe it.

I asked authorities to remove this clearly abusive person from my room, but all they gave me was a paper with a strongly worded warning. Kevin hasn't left, he just became a bit more sedate.

1924,kelliwk,1613591145,"I was diagnosed with depression at 13 and anxiety/panic attacks at 15. I am now almost 33. I’ve had it under control for a good portion of my adult life (with and without medication) but every once in a while I guess it builds up and I kind of implode? I’ve had two episodes (once at 23 and again two years ago) where I feel like I have tunnel vision, no concept of time, etc for about a week, usually brought on by consumption of stimulants. So I stopped all stimulants aside from a cup of coffee if needed. 

So I had/have/am recovering from covid since about 1/31, feel pretty much totally fine now aside from congestion. I work in a restaurant and my first day back was Valentine’s Day because I was needed. The two weeks prior, I was quarantining and legit not leaving my bed. Just sat around watching tv. I did experience a ton of anxiety from having covid, would obsessively check my vitals and just generally wonder if my symptoms would suddenly get way worse because everyone’s case is different and there’s no real timeline. Also Googling symptoms or anything about covid is a bad idea. 

My first day back to work was busy af, 9 hours of running around with an already elevated heart rate. I ate well that morning, but only had a protein shake while at work. Ate that night when I got home, but had heart palpitations and couldn’t sleep. Took five big hits off my weed pen to go to sleep and instead, got the worst panic attack of my life. 

I was dizzy, nauseous, and my heart rate dropped suddenly from a steady 111 while resting to 76 (normal rate but the drop made me panic more and think my heart was stopping). I managed to fall asleep for about 45 minutes (this all started around 4am I think). Woke up and my tongue and lips were numb. That’s never ever happened to me before and I freaked out. Had a massive panic attack for two hours while my friend tried to calm me down over text. Almost called 911. Finally chilled out enough and got feeling back in my mouth but I couldn’t sleep. Every time I tried, I would twitch back awake. My boyfriend came over that evening to stay with me and I felt better but still very off and exhausted, and after being awake for about 36 hours I managed to sleep. 

Yesterday I felt foggy, tired, nauseous. Felt like a hangover. Cried for a while. Started feeling better towards the evening then I got a weird dissociative feeling where I felt detached from my body and surroundings. It didn’t last too long, I distracted myself and fell asleep. 

I just woke up today super anxious again. I spoke with a doctor yesterday about switching my meds. I’ve been taking Bupropion XL 300mg since 11/27, and added 5mg buspirone once a day a few weeks ago. He wants me to stop the buspirone immediately and start back on Citalopram which is what I was on before moving to Bupropion (because I thought it would give me energy). Last time I took Bupropion was 2016/2017 and it gave me mad anxiety but I thought it was because of a situation I was dealing with, and I also started drinking on it after about three months. Bad choice. Stopped taking it. I guess the anxiety was actually the meds because it’s happening again?

I don’t know if I’m feeling withdrawals now because I cold turkey stopped (last pill was two days ago) or is residual. I have to go back to work tomorrow and I’m already anxious because of everything that happened even though I’m def not touching weed for a while. I’m usually pretty good at coping but I feel kind of out of control of my brain right now and I’m sure it’s temporary but it’s exhausting me and making me feel sick. I just took 10mg of citalopram before I work up to the full dose of 20 and I’m hoping a little serotonin will help. 

I really don’t know what I’m trying to accomplish with posting this. Boyfriend brought me a breakfast burrito and I can’t eat it, and I’d planned to leave my house today to run errands and just generally get out, but now I don’t want to, I want to sleep because if I’m asleep I won’t be anxious. I’d rather be depressed than anxious and my depression can be BAD so that’s saying something.

I’ve been dealing with a myriad of health issues/concerns this year. I started getting frequent ectopic beats back in April, which stopped after 3 months. I get random bouts of feeling disconnected or like I’m watching my life from behind a monitor, trembling, balance issues, all which play into feeling actually anxious.

The thing I’m confused about, is are all of those anxiety even if I don’t feel anxious until I feel them?  Like can you have anxiety episodes without feeling nervous at all?

I have been useless the last few days and my anxiety and panic have taken over my life completely. I had a brief moment this morning where I felt okay, but started focusing on upcoming responsibilities and spiraled into the same sorry state I’ve been in lately. I’m extremely cold, shaky, fearful, hopeless, and exhausted. My spouse has tried to ground me and remind me of how good my life really is. That this will end. They’re feeling this too as a result of my mood. 

My spouse responded, “I don’t know how to help you.” It then occurred to me that I don’t even know what to to say if asked, “How can I help you?” My first inclination is to be comforted and held and reassured everything will be okay.

What would you say is the best thing to help when you’re going through episodes of severe anxiety and panic? What would you want someone to do for you?

Things have been going so well for me lately and I knew something had to rear its head at some point. Embarrassing as it is to say, I’m having dick pain. It’s just mild discomfort right at the end, but I don’t know what’s causing it, my doctor told me basically just to chill out keep it clean and wait a couple weeks. But I can’t stop my mind from going to “it’s going to be here forever, your partner is going to leave you, you’re never going to be without this”. 

I’m clearly triggered because in a past relationship a girlfriend of mine had something very similar that didn’t go away for almost a year and the chronic pain completely changed her. It fucked both of us up and put an enormous strain on the relationship - not being able to have sex for months and months because of the pain. Eventually she became angry, spiteful, directing it at me and I had to leave. It broke my heart at the time and I still don’t blame her but I had to look out for myself.

1. I get anxious/obsessed about something that’s either unlikely to happen, or a thousand miles away from my life.

5. I obsess over the thing for about a week, I don’t usually get peace for more than 1 hour, except when I’m sleeping.

6. I somehow stop obsessing over the thing, get about an afternoon of peace, and then move on to be anxious about the next thing.

1940,BubbyNotOverSo,1613588115,"Hi there..I'm new around here but I want to get straight to the point. I consider myself a big overthinker. I don't like self diagnosing but I'm confident I've had anxiety for quite some time mostly relating to school. Constant worrying, loss of appetite, increased heart rate, body weakness, cold sweating, loss of motivation and at nights crying until I fall asleep. Its only gotten worse over the last 3 years where it became a monthly cycle down to a weekly cycle of the same thing repeating itself; I think about something related to school, that would then lead to me worrying about many many things related to it and I start crying (mostly at nights considering thats when I have time for myself). Its extremely frustrating when I can't control my thoughts especially when the immediate response is to ""think positively about it"" by others. I can't do that. The negative thoughts overpower the positive ones before I can get a grip on them to the point where I let the cycle happen and get up the next day like its nothing jus waiting for that one thought to invade again. I spoke with my mother about my feelings recently(since I realized how bad it was getting) and she finally accepted after all the years of crying my eyes out in front of her that she could have gone about things differently. But I feel like the damage has been done since as far back as I can remember this feeling started 5 years ago but I was too young to comprehend what it was. (I'm 15 now). For context it starts off as one sentence that spirals into oblivion. ""I have a bunch of notes for 9 subjects"" then goes to ""you have exams in a few months"" ""everyone is watching you need to do good"" ""you need to pass to get a proper job as she always says"" ""she said she won't be disappointed but you know she will be"" ""but you can do it right"" ""i have to do this because I have no choice"" ""what about your future"" etc is jus a small example of everything that mushes together in my head 1 am in the morning. After speaking with my mother the only thing that seems to have crossed off the list is me crying at nights. For a long time I felt like I can't fix this, no one is helping no matter who I speak too and she gave me a ray of hope when I finally opened up to her but I feel like nothing was solved other than her saying she will ""back off"" just a bit. I'm making this post cause the thoughts are resurfacing and I'm currently biting my nails and sucking back some tears over a damn test. I apologize for the long rant but is there anyone even just one person that has a little advice on how to calm my thoughts when one slips in? Or even helping my mother understand that even tho she is ""backing off"" I still feel like shit. (Adding to that, no, distracting myself doesn't help anymore.

She just got married, just got a new job after she left her old one that was making her unhappy, and she and her husband are making more money during covid than ever. She has been seeing a therapist for the past year and she talks about it like its helped her too. 

So I have been really confused by her attitude towards me and I dont even know if she realizes she's doing it, but even when I express I dislike something she just turns it around that I should be more considerate about her feelings instead. I already have a tendency to feel guilty over every little thing so this really messes with my head.

What I mean by talking to me differently is she tends to put down things I like or shut me out of conversations.

I cant tell if shes not listening or if she just wants to feel like it was her idea or something. If she walks in on my lunch breaks she might make a comment asking if I'm even working today etc...just super subtle or backhanded out of nowhere.

I bought myself a Nintendo switch and I bought myself an iPad for illustration after saving a fair bit of money. Having something to do in the evenings and being lucky to have a job during all this has helped massively. I did really well, got promoted etc while managing a mental health condition that I don't speak about.

I switched off the news a lot and just reminded myself to keep on top of the latest updated that changed my everyday life like being able to drive outside my town, see my family etc.

Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago we lost someone in my family and I attended the funeral this week.

Now it feels like the reality of the past year has hit me like a steam train, all at once. Going to the funeral and being surrounded my grief has really hit me hard. It isn't anything I can escape from and I feel like it's having a domino effect on my emotions.

I can't concentrate at work, my head is like mashed potato, I keep crying, and my anxiety is making me feel like I'm stuck on a rollercoaster waiting for it to drop. I just want to sleep all day and cuddle my cat (who is being very affectionate with me atm)

Hi guys,

So recently I’ve been having intrusive thoughts about almost anything and everything. My fear is psychosis so it causes me to latch onto the fear of it and relating all my thoughts to them.

This evening I was sitting with my girlfriend and her mum and we were talking about random things and I did not once think of my thoughts or wonder and question everything that happens in front of me. My thoughts have been surrounded by horrible anxiety and knots in my stomach.

What if my food is poisoned 

What if I start to believe my thoughts

What if the government are after me/anyone for that matter

What if I think the tv/radio is talking to me

What if everything is real or what if there is things in the world that I control.

Absolutely none of these thoughts I believe. I seemed to have conditioned my thoughts into relating them to all be “what if” thoughts then I question everything and anything. Even things i see or do I question it. I’m starting to get a tad angry at it tbh. My psychologist said it’s certainly not schizophrenia or anything like that it’s more of obsessive thinking. I honestly obsess over all my thoughts and feelings which makes me think I’m going insane and crazy. It’s a horrible feeling and I just feel like I can’t enjoy anything I do just now. Always wondering what people think of me and if they like me. What if people are looking at me or talking about me. I know that they aren’t but my thoughts latch onto the fact of “what if”.

Has anyone else ever had these type of thoughts like constant throughout the day no matter what you think about or anything like that.

At the beginning it was okay, but now I’m in my second quarter and nearing the end, and my anxiety is sky rocketing. I used to eat a small breakfast, then lunch, then dinner, with some snacking in between, but now it’s just a small brunch or just snacks and then dinner because I’m too anxious to go out and don’t even feel hungry. I was doing good talking to people and meeting new people, and now I just wanna stay with the few Ive connected with because Im exhausted and scared to bother new people.

1977,Specialist_Rutabaga6,1613546693,"This one goes out especially for all the teenagers and University/college-going people. Hi, My name is Kishan. Like a lot of others from this subreddit group, I too had severe family issues growing up. A parent with anger issues and another not really there because of several reasons. I grew up watching a lot of evil people being praised and looked upon for being very ""religious"" yet lacking utmost humanity and respect towards anyone that can't benefit them. I was bullied for my skin color all throughout middle school. Fast forward to high school, I went through several changes and never tend to find myself. Always felt like I didn't belong to most cliques. I was always confident about my intelligence and my whole being for some weird reason, so I always expected a lot more from life and had a strong faith I'd be the person I envision. Going to University, indulging in partying, boozing, girls, I completely lost myself. I lost my identity, I used to be the person anyone wanted me to be. My people skills were unparalleled. All of it because I was unhappy with myself, my achievements, my existence. I had already made a lot of mistakes which was weighing down on me. Towards the end of university, it was too much for me. I snapped and coped with my emotions with different substances. When I tried quitting the substances, it became literal hell. So I was out there with 0 friends, crippling withdrawal symptoms, anger towards my family, and disgust towards who I am.  
Fast forward a few months later, I became the happiest I have EVER been, working hardest on self growth than I have ever in the past, kindest I've ever been, much better at making the right choices and picking the right friends. My biggest tip to ANYONE suffering from anxiety or depression (First of all, PLEASE seek help, your university/college/school offers a lot of free resources if there is a financial burden) is FIND HAPPINESS WITHIN YOURSELF. Most of our anxiety stems from people whether how they treated us in the past or how we treated them. The moment you take away the power of anyone affecting your mental health in any sort of way, you'll be invincible. The moment you realize, in order to be happy, all you have to do is train your brain to be happy with your existence, your being, and nothing else, your life will be different. Forget about ANYBODY's opinion for a second, focus on yourself, and listen to your heart. At the end of the day, when push comes to shove, your ""best friend"" will pick their own benefit. No one loves you as you/your parents do, 

How can you love yourself and completely disregard anybody's opinion and take away their power of affecting you? through being mindful, being present, being spiritual. Being able to shut down your fight./flight instinct. Putting your faith in the divine, WHOEVER that is. Not putting a label on it, Believe that everything happens for a reason, your destiny is different from anybody else on this planet. You cannot compare your life to anyone, trust the destiny you are meant to be on, trust yourself. You have made this far enduring everything that life has thrown at you, you're very much capable of ANYTHING. Accept it when you're having a severe anxiety attack, acknowledge it, tell yourself it will get better, believe in yourself. Acceptance, gratitude, forgive.

Felt like I was going to feint, lightheaded, weak body, heart started racing, racing thoughts, blurry vision, etc. I've had anxiety attacks before but I was really frightened because it happened out of nowhere. I was not currently thinking about anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an extremely anxious person and I'm worried I've worried myself into some anxiety disorder :/

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the ER the night of my anxiety attack because afterwards I was still just...off. And I would get random little waves of lightheadedness and body weakness. I was also having palpitations. ER said I was perfectly healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few days now and I just don't feel normal still. I am experiencing what I think is depersonalization/derealization sometimes. My vision has been very ""shakey"" especially when reading. Idk how to explain how my vision has been but it just hasn't been normal. My dreams have been extremely vivid and I've been having really bad sleep anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not as bad as I was the day after the ER visit, but I still get random palpitations or lightheadedness. I also keep feeling like I'm about to swallow my tongue constantly. I keep getting ""waves"" of pain through my body that last like a split second. Idk how to describe it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you all experience after affects of anxiety attacks multiple days after the inital attack? Is this normal? Or is there something truly wrong with me. Scared I have developed some mental illness (on top of the clinical anxiety/depression I already had.)

I just need a friend that gets it tbh. Or someone who can offer me some new insight. 

I’ve had a very severe GAD/panic disorder for years that constantly disrupts my day to day life. When i’m in the midst of what I think is a panic attack, like what’s happening right now, I start to panic even more because I have no one to talk to to distract me or help me calm down or ground me and reassure me that it’s just anxiety. 

Because my mind jumps straight to, “it’s definitely not anxiety this time. head to the ER ASAP.” And I can’t keep doing this. It’s like, sure, the last 30 times you went to the ER it did end up being just anxiety, but what if this time it isn’t?? 

I can no longer trust my own judgement or my body, I cannot tell which symptoms are just anxiety and which are genuinely a medical emergency. It happens out of nowhere which is what throws me off. Nothing in particular triggers my panic attacks. 

I’m so tired. I just wanna talk to someone who understands me. 

I don’t even have any meds rn. I was laying in bed trying to take relax, take a nap and all of a sudden felt short of breath, and then when I noticed I was having shortness of breath, I started to panic immediately and my heart started racing and pounding and then I had to jump out of my bed and try to “leave.”

I used to be positive, and have good thoughts about my future. So approximately 1,5 months ago, i had a small anxiety attack before bed. This was triggered by vibration/chills I got in my body after reading about something in the News. I felt like I was going to black out, and started shaking. The big issue is that this lead to many physical symptoms, and depression in the long run. This made me worried, and I got health anxiety all of a sudden. The physical symptoms were so many that i thought, it was not just mental problems I had.
- chest burn/mild pain/ tightness
- numbness everywhere
- head pressure, and ear ringing.
- Constipation
- frequent urination
- loss of appetite (This got alot better 3-4 weeks ago)
- No joy in life.
- Death anxiety.
- Low energy levels
- Heart burn
- tingling and pricking on parts of body.
- Weight loss
- blood in stool (rare)
- less sensation in legs
- Burning sensation in thighs
- Heavy chest feeling
- Dizziness and a drunk/high feeling
- less tolerance
- Balance problems
- Breathing problems.
- throbbing throat
- Problems sleeping, and sometimes headache when I wake up. 

These symptoms come and go. Sometimes newer symptoms may occur.

It was mainly my anxiety and his inability to let the past go.  We had quite the history and our lives started taking a total 180 (for the better) but it was unfamiliar territory and it wasn't working together despite how things were looking up.  

I still think of him as my best friend, things are still all over the place in my mind.  He ended up 'cheating' on me after a month of the 'breakup'.  At that point, I thought I was only giving him space.. motherfucker wasn't able to 'break up' with me in person after avoiding me for a month, and then I figured out he brought this girl up to his family's home in another city with his friends and slept with her.

It made me start to think about my anxiety and face it for the first time in a long time...I've been 'fixing' it for about a year now, but I was only focused on fixing my thought patterns.  I focus on having a PMA (positive mental attitude) all the time.  IT really helps, and I often don't fall into anxious thinking anymore

This week, he texted me asking for something of his back, I saw the text and started to shake, my shoulders and arms went number, I started to sweat profusely while feeling totally chilly and sick to my stomach - this lasted a good 20 minutes.

I literally realized in that moment, that even in our relationship, I often had the same reaction to his text messages.  He was always bad at communicating, so when he did I seemed to have this visceral/physical reaction? Before he would come over to my house, I would always get anxious and start to sweat and feel sick to my stomach.  This probably went on for a good portion of last year.

I get like this a lot now, this bubbled up anxiety coming out as physical reactions even though my mind isn't panicking.. how can I calm this down?  What is happening to my body!

I’ve made a FQA for my acc, but it was mainly to pin point out my DM problem.

I’m have an art acc and have received DMs from people asking all sorts of questions that make me uncomfortable.

I’m very much of a push over and very shy so For the most part I kinda just played along with it. But These same people have been DMing me for Almost a full year now and I don’t have the confidence to tell them “hey, please leave me alone” since there actually nice people! 

so I decided to make a FQA, mainly highlighting my DM rules about whats right and wrong. Without having to tell them directly and in hopes they finally get the hint. 

Only issue is that I feel like my Answers to some of these question may sound a bit aggressive or harsh, which I don’t want to come off as but idk how to re-word them if they do come off as mean.

So I’m wanting some feedback on how I answered these questions (only for the DM section) and if they do sound mean, how should I re-word it?

I fear if I were ever unemployed all that time would make me go crazy :(. I also suffer from harm OCD (my biggest fear right now) so having that and endless time scares me as well.

The first day of hangover is usually chill, because the alcohol is still not out of the system and we all know that alcohol is probably the worst way to treat anxiety, but it does the trick! 

Second day of hangover (today) is anxious and depression filled. Right now, I have horrible anxiety about the future, today, work, relationship, house, and everything. I have anxiety anyway, but lately I've been dealing with it and it was just minimal, but today it's exceptionally bad, that's the reason I hate drinking, next day I always feel like shit. If I drink a lot, the next day is chill, just as I described, but if I drink moderately, I wake up depressed and anxious the next morning.

Let me vent a bit! On Thursday I have to move out of my rent and I'm anxious about that, also I feel like I'm not a good boyfriend, I feel like I won't be able to complete university, afraid I will be fired from my job, constantly anxious about everything.

There is a supermarket about 20 minutes from where I live I need to go to later this afternoon (UK time btw) to pick up groceries to make some food since I've been completely unmotivated and lazy this entire pandemic so I wanna have something good to tell my therapist and do an achievement. The reason I'm anxious is because I'm deathly scared of seeing people I know, ex-friends/dickhead lads who yell shit at me/confronted by a group of bored teenagers who need someone to take the piss out of/etc etc as I live in a very community centric small town area and the only decent close shop there is anywhere where I live is smack bang in the main teenager hangout area. Theres a popular park behind the supermarket and the surrounding area also is a popular place as people walk too and fro. These people dont give a shit abt lockdown btw, I'm only going shopping once out of months in quarantine with a mask, hand sanitizer and social distancing either  limited shopping list.

2019,SerDulac,1613475009,"This has been a problem plaguing me for years, and its only recently that I accepted that I have a problem with anxiety. Whenever I see a deadline looming, even though I've got plenty of time to accomplish whatever it is, be it work, school, etc. I always feel a gripping sense of dread. I usually do finish them in time and perform adequately. I do feel a sense of relief when I've finished them or when my performance gets a great reception. However, afterwards I feel just as anxious because there's another task that needs doing. It sometimes feels like life is a never-ending cycle of work to do and anxiety in between. Even when I immerse myself in doing things on my downtime, I still feel it gripping me and can't get it out of my head.   


This type of anxiety has gone to the point where I have a hard time enjoying the things I love and spending time with loved ones because work is always at the back of my mind. It's also stopped me from reaching my full potential because I'm just so afraid of the pressure of doing more tasks. It's gotten to the point where thought of doing simple errands makes me dread the day I have to do them. Sometimes, I even keep myself up late at night just so I won't have to do them. It's some sort of sleep procrastination. I acknowledge I have a problem and I would love to seek help once I am financially able, and independent enough (my parents don't believe I need help and I still live and rely on them). However, I'm not at that point yet.

My mother passed away really traumatically almost 4 years ago now and at the time I was on top of my career, had a great relationship and a brilliant support circle around me, I was fit and healthy and was coping with everything pretty well. I went travelling to 'find myself' as you do after events like that, came home, got a job a dream job but then started suffering from PTSD from not only the trauma of losing my mum but I went though multiple horrific events which I won't detail here. My 'dream job' turned out to be the worst job I've ever had and so I left my job for as it was causing me incredible amounts of anxiety and haven't been able to work full time since (it's been a year and a half). I went through a bit of a mental breakdown and was signed off work for a while and with a lot of therapy, I have slowly have been getting back on track as much as I can but there is one thing holding me back. My 'child brain'. 

Since the trauma, I have this constant voice in my head that I like to call the 'child me' who is constantly not wanting to do certain things. I can't complete projects or tasks, I'm terrified of restarting my career, I can't seem to keep up my fitness, etc etc. It yo-yos so much and I got into an okay place in lockdown and managed to kickstart my fitness again but it's taken a massive nose dive again and this seems to be a pattern that I really can't break. I really want to get back to the motivated and outgoing person I was. I write lists and make plans for my weeks and feel like my old self but it gets to Monday and my anxiety child creeps back in.

One of the most interesting things to come from the chat was the fact that even though they were really dying and truly fighting for their life the cancer wasn't their life. This person said they often felt completely normal and was able to think clearly (when the meds would allow). 

Seemed to me that cancer wasn't their life just apart of it that they were battling with.

I was comparing it to my anxiety and the effects of anxiety has on my day. This left me even more confused than ever. I was speaking to someone who could of very easily died for real and they were expressing that they could relax on the good days and just be themselves, then there was me who had nothing ""wrong"" with them who can be consumed by this non stop feeling of dreed and confusion.

This may sound a little strange to people reading this and I can completely understand why you may be a little confused by what I'm trying to say. I'm not sure I'm wording it correctly but it is something I wanted to share with you.

I believe that the brain is extremely powerful and controls EVERYTHING within the body so when anxiety takes control of the brain it in turn takes control of everything with it. 

Anxiety controls your sense of reality and that ""anxiety reality"" becomes your reality because that is all you now know.

In a strange way I wish I was battling a ""real"" illness, something you can really fight unlike your own mind which you will never win.

2044,Looking_for_help4,1613463653,"Hi all, I'm looking for some help and guidance! I'm currently on 40mg prozac trying to combat an anxiety and panic disorder and depression which comes due to feeling so defeated from the panic and anxiety. I'll summarize the last 6 months and where I am today as short as i can. 

Last September I had been on Prozac 20mg for 2 years and was feeling great. I was previously on 10mg Lexapro for 6 years which worked great until one day it didn't hence the change. 

The Prozac took a good 8 - 12 weeks to really kick in until i felt back to normal but once it did I was able to again live my life with minimal anxiety, panic and depression which is enough for me. I don't need the feelings completely gone, although that would be a dream but i just need the levels low enough that i can function as a Father, Husband and be successful in my career.

So back to September 2020 I was feeling good and when going in to see my doctor for my new set of scripts for Prozac the doctor suggested i cut down to 10mg and to see if i could tolerate the lower dose with the hope of one day being off the prozac all together. I agreed.

All was well for four weeks until i started feeling the anxiety starting to creep back in to my life. I stuck with the 10mg for another four weeks trying to get through with exercise, meditation and healthy eating. By the middle of November the anxiety had heightened so I went back on 20mg of Prozac as it had worked before.

I gave this 20mg prozac 10 weeks to start working in the hope of getting back to where i was in September 2020. I could never get there anxiety was high, panic attacks were coming back and so was the depression.

I went back to my doctor and was given the option of changing to Zoloft or increasing the Prozac to 40mg a day. Knowing how awful it was to change medications last time i hoped in my head there would be less side effects staying on the Prozac and increasing my dose.

I'm still clinging to this hope but the last 3 weeks since I've upped the Prozac to 40mg have been a struggle.

Week 1 on 40mg my heightened anxiety increased when i thought it couldnt get much higher.

Week 2 i had some moments on some days where i felt calm and thought maybe it's slowly beginning to work. The constant anxiety was a little lower this week as well.

Week 3 I've started having panic attacks again and the anxiety is high in the mornings and lowers towards the end of the day.

I'm about to enter week 4 and I'm hoping with every inch of my body that one day this week I'll start to get some improvement. 

I guess my question is has anyone else been in this same situation with Prozac or when increasing it? Will it get better? Should i persist or go back to the doctor and swap over to Zoloft? If i swap over to Zoloft how many more weeks of my life will i lose to being riddled with panic, anxiety and depression before i feel some relief?

Sorry.. mind detailed there.. ANYWAY I decided I would just watch a movie. Why not I can’t sleep anyway?!? (Hello anxiety insomnia!) so I watched Greenland! Why?!? Because I like kicking myself!!! 


I usually try to avoid doomsday movies for this very reason. I always end up having the worst anxiety after. But it also seemed like the only good new thing to watch at the moment so I thought I could do it. 

I also didn’t do enough research and once I started I was invested in seeing the end!! Well got to the end and while it tried to take a positive spin the scientific portion of my brain started playing out how it would go.. that lead me down the rabbit hole of thoughts! 

That lead to me realizing “I’m not prepared for anything!” I’ve done all I can just to stay on top of a pandemic but these kind of scenarios where the literal sky is falling or the ground is breaking or god forbid war! I’m just not prepared in the least.

The whole concept scares the crud out of me and I’m stuck here obsessing over it. Last month I started panicking about what would happen if I lost my husband! I started stressing about that. I just can’t catch a break right now.

i apologized to them and had the courage to tell them about my worsening anxiety. my only intentions were to prevent any misunderstandings they had about me and to avoid them from hating me. one of them already sort of knew i had social anxiety so she was super understanding about it. the other friend however, he doesn't know me that well. when i told them that my anxiety was getting worse it sounded like i was making up an excuse, and that i was attention seeking. i didn't know what other ways i could prevent them from hating and having misunderstandings of me. i'm scared of being hated by others. especially when they're the people you cherish a lot. i feel pretty shit now.

She is super pretty, dress elegant, act classy, super sweet, and act super confident in a good way by her body language. I am girl who has insecurities, anxiety, and some ocd and whenever I see someone who's pretty and confident who I wish to be, I panic. So whenever I walk pass by her in the hallway or see her, my body and mind freezes with panic attacks, body starts to shake/tremble in fear, which happened many times. I also admire her confidence and hijab, which is one reason that causes this whole thing, it's because I wish I could wear one since it looks classy although i'm not muslim. Whenever she see me, she probably wonders to herself why is this random person so afraid of me. I tried to put myself in her situation and realized that she is human too, but that didn't work.

It gets worse.

When I went on insta I randomly found her account through suggestions, so I clicked on her public account. Now we probably all done this before; so I went through some of her highlighted stories and accidentally went through one that was currently posted on her insta story, which is a problem because she would then see who viewed her story. Somehow although she doesn't know me, she recognized that girl who is scared of her (me) and blocked me!!!! Which to her is super creepy. Now i'm even more afraid of her and I no longer see her since she is gone.

Now I need advice on how to stop having panic attacks around people who are confident and wish to be. Also I would like to hear your guys opinion on this situation if you don't mind sharing. I also need help on analyzing this situation.

I emailed a few places a few days ago, but tomorrow I’m making myself call a mental health agency and express my interest in doing practicum there and seeing if I could talk to someone. I’ve done a load of rational and positive self talk, but my anxiety is still lodged firmly in my chest! It’s so frustrating. I know I can get through it, and I am determined to do it tomorrow because I see my therapist on Wednesday and I would like to process this experience with her, but at the same time it’s so scary and distressing.

Sometimes I look at my life and could just break down and cry. It’s difficult because the people in my life I love so much. My children are the best part of my entire life. And I love them more than words could ever express. But I’m deeply struggling every day. I’m trying so hard to see purpose. And I see that they need me, and I often wonder what their lives would be like if I wasn’t around. I wonder if it’d be better for them. Sometimes I think it may be better for everyone.  I have intrusive thoughts of letting go. It often scares me and I shake it off. But I’m hurting and I don’t know why. I have everything I could need. I’m a stay at home mom. I’m overwhelmed and I feel very very alone. I can’t even express it to anyone and I feel like if I try I’m afraid they won’t understand the severity of my depression. And if they did I’m more afraid of how they would try to help. I often think of what I need to do to help myself with my constant anxiety. I go through days of excessive worry. Every night I feel sick. My anxiety causes physical symptoms and I feel ill a lot. This has been worse lately. I used to never have any issue, I never had anxiety. But now it’s so severe that I often think I’m dying of an illness. A part of me doesn’t want to do it anymore. I keep trying to think of the future and see how this eventually will get better. But I feel like I’m trapped in a circle of pain. Where this is a loop that will never end. I’ll never get better. I’ll always go through these bouts of sickness that leave me too sick to get up, too sick to enjoy life. I don’t want to do it anymore. I’m so incredibly tired I dread the next day before it even starts. I don’t feel good ever. I’ve learned to hide it because I don’t want to be a burden to my husband. I don’t want to make my husband or children suffer because of me. Sometimes I want to crawl in a hole and never come out. I want to be better, I want to stop feeling the way I do.

2081,Sweet-Chocolate4993,1613449156,"So at my school, there is a girl who I don't know and never spoke to, just see her passing by in the hall. She is super pretty, dress elegant, act classy, super sweet, and act super confident in a good way by her body language. I am girl who has insecurities, anxiety, and some ocd and whenever I see someone who's pretty and confident who I wish to be, I panic. So whenever I walk pass by her in the hallway or see her, my body and mind freezes with panic attacks, body starts to shake/tremble in fear, which happened many times. I also admire her confidence and hijab, which is one reason that causes this whole thing, it's because I wish I could wear one since it looks classy although i'm not muslim. Whenever she see me, she probably wonders to herself why is this random person so afraid of me. I tried to put myself in her situation and realized that she is human too, but that didn't work.

It gets worse.

When I went on insta I randomly found her account through suggestions, so I clicked on her public account. Now we probably all done this before; so I went through some of her highlighted stories and accidentally went through one that was currently posted on her insta story, which is a problem because she would then see who viewed her story. Somehow although she doesn't know me, she recognized that girl who is scared of her (me) and blocked me!!!! Which to her is super creepy. Now i'm even more afraid of her and I no longer see her since she is gone.

Now I need advice on how to stop having panic attacks around people who are confident and wish to be. Also I would like to hear your guys opinion on this situation if you don't mind sharing. I also need help on analyzing this situation.

I’m so sick of being invited places or events that I can’t go to because of anxiety but my anxiety isn’t a “good enough” excuse not to go so I have to make something up. It happens to me whenever I’m invited somewhere that I can’t deal with. I’m at the point where I always give a lie as an excuse because so many people have mocked and invalidated my anxiety. 
A prime example of this is movie theaters— I cannot do them. It’s not going to happen. I don’t need to change it, it’s not a big deal to me. However, whenever I was invited to the movies I’d explain my anxiety and people are like nah like it’s no big deal just come and would keep going over and over until I just lied about why I couldn’t go. 

I’m just sick and tired of anxiety not being a valid reason for not wanting to do something. I’m sick of being laughed at and mocked for it. Don’t know if others experience the same thing I’m just really mad about it right now.

We didn't go to the same school and didn't visit that often in person, but we texted almost every day and always had these deep, thoughtful and emotional conversations.

This past year she's been replying a lot slower to my texts (from hours to multiple days... meanwhile she posts on social media and is clearly active) and then, in September... completely ghosted me in the middle of a simple conversation. Our friendship didn't end on a fight or disagreement, I don't think we've ever even disagreed on anything I can think of... I'm just so confused and honestly heartbroken why she stopped talking to me. I think about this almost everyday, but on some days it really hurts and damages how I feel about myself. I've always been super introverted, awkward, quiet and I've never really had luck with friendships. She knew this and I think that makes me feel even worse.

Lately, I've been exercising and eating much healthier in an attempt to help with my mental health and low self worth, but I'm not sure how to get rid of this specific, icky feeling towards this friend. A part of me wants to unfollow/soft block her on instagram (I already unfriended her on facebook but she doesn't use that), but I'm not sure if that would make things worse. Even seeing her name on social media gives me this ache in my chest and sometimes ruins my day (same with other ex-friends). I think something that scares me is that I might have classes with her in University and just that it's not unlikely I'll run into her sometime.

Maybe i went outside like once or twice a month. 6 Months later i had my first panic attack ever. And i have had them ever since. Sometimes more, sometimes less. The panic attacks also pretty much come out of nowhere.

She has pretty severe anxiety, particularly social anxiety (and goes to therapy for it). Last Wednesday she started texting less and taking longer to respond, didn't respond at all on Friday, and has a bit more each day since then but still not much. When I asked her about it she said that she just didn't feel like talking and that she was responding late to everyone. But on Tuesday she was talking to me at night about how she feels like her friends don't actually like her and that they just talk to her because they feel like they have to or something. I obviously did my best to reassure her, but I didn't say anything about myself specifically because it didn't really register with me that she could be talking about me as well. Is it weird to ask her if that is in any way the reason why she doesn't feel like talking? I just want to make sure she doesn't think that I don't want to talk to her or that I feel forced to be her friend or something like that.

Edit: Or would it be better to ask if she minds if I still send her things? Or maybe a combination of both?

i had always had problems with anxiety but they were quite minor, and didn’t massively effect me day to day. i think after lockdown (here in new zealand, so about may-ish) is when things became unbearable, and i had started taking fluoxetine. for months i was having panic attacks almost every day, and i always felt constantly on edge and fatigued. every day was just so draining, and it was embarrassing to have to constantly ask to take breathers at work (luckily my manager has been super supportive and i am so grateful for her, i know some people don’t have the privilege of having managers that understanding) 
i stopped taking my medication after i had accidentally left them at my boyfriends house and sort of fell out of the routine of taking them. of course i suffered a couple side effects like headaches and (for me at least) irregular BM, but it was nothing a little panadol couldn’t fix. then i realised about a week later, “hey, i haven’t had a panic attack in a couple days” and was half expecting one to come along later on. but it’s been about 3 weeks and i haven’t had one!!! (knock on wood lol) sure i still get a bit cloudy sometimes but i’m so proud of myself for the progress i’ve made. i’ve been trying to keep my head up and push back any negative thoughts that intrude. 

i know a lot of people have it much worse than i do, but i just wanted to make this post to say that even when you feel like you’re in the dark and there’s no way out, you will get there eventually. it might not be tomorrow, next week or even next year. even if you feel like it’s not, the hardest you try is always the best, way way way better than nothing! remember that you need to have bad days to truely appreciate the good ones. you have support all around you if you need it, wether it be the closest people to you, or random strangers on the internet. you got this, we believe in you!! :) &lt;3",Anxiety,anxiety progress,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lksvr6/anxiety_progress/,1613411490.0

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all. I just picked up my first prescription for propanolol 10mg today, but I'm having a hard time getting myself to take it. Long story short I was prescribed this for debilitating health anxiety that began manifesting some very nasty and unwelcome physical reactions. The physical reactions create a vicious cycle of hyperfocusing on said physical symptoms, specifically my heart rate, which causes me to be more anxious, then I have a panic attack, then I worry about my heart rate rising during my panic attack, then my anxiety rises, then I have a panic attack again, and so on and so forth, you know the drill. The problem is.... my health anxiety heavily revolves around my heart and fear of dying. I've had multiple EKGs, cardiologist appointments, and a Holter monitor as recently as December, all of which have told me my heart is healthy, but I'm constantly in fear that my heart is going to stop at any moment. When my heart rate became a constant resting rate of over 100, my doctor offered this prescription to help with the physical conditions of my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited at first, it felt like a huge step in the right direction,  but the fear has dug its claws in again once more and I fell into Web MD hell, which promptly erased any shred of confidence I had in taking this drug. I know I'm physically healthy. I know for a fact I have no heart problems. But I can't get past the thought that as soon as I take this medication, I'm going to drop dead of cardiac arrest, the second it hits my tongue. I'm terrified. I shoved the medication bag under my pillow so I don't have to think about it oe look at it. It is now the pillows problem to deal with. I'm trying my best to stop looking up ""propanolol deaths"" and doomscrolling pubmed articles but I just can't shake the feeling that it's going to kill me, as much as I want to be rid of these physical symptoms, I want more to not die. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess in conclusion, what I'm looking for is reassurance. Any and all. Tell me how your medication changed your life for the better. I would love if someone who has had a similar situation, whether it's the same medication or not, can tell me how taking the dreaded instadeath pill went for them, and how very much alive they are today. I'd like knowledge from people who understand the risks (or lack of) of this medication to inform me that it's benign and remind me that my doctor (bless her heart, she is a liter angel) isn't out to kill me. I want to hear from people who have also taken this medication, and are here to type to me today.

I used to be able to leave the house, go to the pub with friends and have a laugh!

Over the past 5 years, I've tried about 8 different SSRI's (currently on mirtazapine), I've had an amazing CBT therapist that's managed to get me from not being able to leave my own room, to occasionally managing to push myself out to the pub with a few friends, which I did in small steps to reach that point over 5 years.

Unfortunately lately I've regressed back to my worse state, in a vicious cycle of being stuck in my room, consistently suffering with panic attacks and feeling sick (which causes my panic attacks to cycle over and over).

Trying to pull myself back for another 5 years is an absolutely unbearable thought and I know to beat all this, I need to restructure my life so once I've beat this, I can stay that way!

At the moment, I've started incorporating progressive muscle relaxation videos once a day and I've dived back into headspace (mobile app) for meditation twice a day.

Now I'm looking for guidance from those of you who are managing to stay on top of your anxieties, what did you incorporate into your day that really helped? Are there any books you found were really helpful? Did meditation work for you and what other techniques did you use that you swear by?

I've suffered from depression,  major abandonment issues and trust issues that i kinda dragged up until this day. i got with my girlfriend since june 2019, she always helped me and was understanding with me and my situation, helped me with my breathing exercises and relaxation methods. we do everything together, and i genuinely love her and have the time of my life when I'm with her.

we've had some arguments over our time together that we resolved by discussing and dialogue. however, since january of this year, we had a major fight over my situation; since november, my issues started resurfacing again, I can't control most of my thoughts and my breathing exercises don't seem to work anymore. I've had major panic attacks eversince and I can't seem to breathe well, let alone my arms that get super tense. 

 after that fight, we decided to take things slow as a way to heal my issues and hers, however, yesterday at 3 am i had a major panic attack, felt paranoid, i couldn't sleep well, and i messaged her telling her that i feel like I'm not enough for her and that i can't control my anxiety anymore. she told me that i always say the same as a way of manipulating her, and then i realized that the very thing i least wanted to take a toll on my life just did some time ago. i let all of my weight onto her and i feel horrible for that.

we decided to take some time, some months to resolve everything within ourselves, she said she's confused now and she doesn't want to be with me but her feeling say otherwise. I can't get that phrase out of my head and i just don't know what to do and what to think, my overthinking just went from 0 to 60 in a second. 

i agreed to take counseling again and fix myself for the better, i want to love myself and stop being lip service ridden. i want to act but i honestly don't know how. i want to take the next step into my life and be the best version of me and keep my way straight, but I'm honestly blocked now. what now? any advice? thanks for the understanding in advance.",Anxiety,"anxiety finally took the heaviest toll, what now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lkpiqy/anxiety_finally_took_the_heaviest_toll_what_now/,1613401044.0

About 3 months ago I had what seemed to be a panic attack. All the tests that were ran (blood work, MRI, EKG, 2 week heart monitor, urine test) came back normal. I was having pretty bad dizziness and vision problems coupled with extreme anxiety. Since then the anxiety and dizziness have settled. Dizziness is basically gone. Anxiety has always been a part of my life, but it’s a little more so now. My main concern is my vision. It is sooo hard to explain to people who can’t see it (as you all know). This is where I’m having a hard time deciding if I even have visual snow or if this is something different. It’s not a static per say (like a tv), but more of speckled colored dots. Very faint but noticeable. I’m super sensitive to light, especially outside. It’s hard to concentrate. This is a constant thing, not episodic. I will say that I am leagues better than when this first started, but the vision is worrying. CTA and EEG also came back normal from the neurologist. Another thing is my brain feels like it’s being squeezed almost? I just need some good news. It’s taking a toll on me. Does anyone have any kind of advice, or recovery stories?

2179,Kiwi_Grey,1613426583,"This is mostly a rant but I also wanted to see if there is anyone else like this because the people I talk to about anxiety problems seem to always have something different (of course because no person is the same). And there is also a tldr at the bottom because I know this is long lol. 

I wouldn’t say I have social anxiety per say, but I don’t like asking for help. My biggest example would be at work. So some background - I am an order puller at Home Depot so I am basically going around shopping for other people when they make orders online. Sometimes we don’t have the product on the shelves where they’re supposed to be so I have to look up on the top shelves for things on pallets to see if the item I need is up there. If it is and I can’t just go on a ladder to get it and I need a machine, I have to ask a coworker who can operate whatever machine I need to get the product. The problem is, I HATE having to ask someone and pull them away from their own stuff because I know they are busy too. I get so nervous trying to ask someone (especially certain people in some departments) I actually have to rehearse what I want to say as I’m trying to find someone and work up the nerve to ask. 

But I also get anxiety about the dumbest things that I can’t really explain to people because they’ll think I’m absolutely insane. Like I can’t go alone into a new store that I’ve never been to because it causes so much anxiety. Because I don’t know what the parking situation is, I don’t know how the store is laid out, how big it is, where things will be, etc. and parking brings me to going over to new peoples houses, where can I park? What if someone parks behind me and I can’t get out? 

Or when I go to someone’s house and I have to use their bathroom. What if the door doesn’t lock and someone walks in on me? What if I clog the toilet and there’s no plunger? And there are so many other thoughts. 

Another example of really small things - at work we had a party like maybe 4 months ago and someone handed me this ticket and we could go to the back to turn it in and you go to pop a balloon and you win a prize. Well me and another coworker had way to much anxiety to go back there and get it, so we went together for emotional support for each other. And yesterday, my supervisor got us these flower crowns and this type of like “coupon card” (they had things like a free extra 15 minute break on there). She wasn’t there yesterday but her husband (who also works there) was and he told me about it. I was too scared to grab one. However I was able to work through it by myself and I ended up getting one because I also didn’t want to miss out on it because they were really cool, but it took me like a good 2 hours to work myself up to it. 

Also at work when one of my bosses asks me to go do something, I always feel like they don’t give enough instructions on HOW they want me to do it and then I worry I’m going to do it wrong. And I get too nervous to ask them for clarification because I worry they’ll get defensive and just tell me to do it. 

All of these little things make it so hard to do most things, especially at work and it makes life so much harder. And this is just the tip of the iceberg I just can’t think of a lot of other examples right now and there’s so many I might as well write a novel. I don’t get to talk about this a lot to many people because people who don’t feel like that probably think I’m crazy and they don’t understand, they just say it’ll be fine just go do it.

I’m not really posting this for advice, but any advice will be gladly taken and greatly appreciated. And I also apologize for this being all over the place it’s just the order I was thinking of it in lol.

For example, I went out for lunch with family at Christmas and to my left I could hear a girl talking to her friend about her college/thesis and to my right was 2 guys talking about the homeless crisis and behind me was some guys that must’ve worked together bitching about some employees. Then I’m listening to the waitresses conversations at the same time. I just hear everything at once and can’t block it out, while trying to maintain conversation with my own family. It’s really draining and it’s not just sounds, I have to look at everyone/their clothes/motions, the walls and the ground - even when walking somewhere and my eyes get tired.

I suffer from different types of anxieties, most people don't notice it, as i keep it bottled up like most people. But recently it really began taking its toll in bed. In general anxiety makes me nauseous, but sexually I was not able to perform. It got worse and worse, to the point where i thought I needed to see a doctor for ED and take pills or something. But I also realized that would be a Band-Aid. I knew the reason was anxiety, but I've been trying to battle it myself whiteout the help of pills or therapy (not the route i would recommend but you all know how that goes). It was getting worse and worse to the point i was dreading sex with my SO. When we would i would be in my head, and not in the moment and it would usually end terribly or i would somehow hold it together long enough to ""finish the task"" for the sake of being done, and not enjoying the process. As a male, this really puts things in my mind of not being able to be a ""man"", cant satisfy my SO, etc.  


I normally steer clear of medication, aside from ibuprofen and vitamins. I don't smoke weed hardly ever. When i drink its because i love whiskey and wine for the taste and the experience, but i could count on one hand how many times I've been drunk over the last few years. I had the bright idea to smoke a little right before we initiated. The few times i do smoke its a very small amount, and i sit there and try and analyze and see how it makes me feel different, or if I feel like I'm less anxious. I never really noticed much of a difference. But this time i did 2 hits instead of one, and was able to let everything naturally happen. It was amazing, and I haven't felt like that with my SO in a long time. I was able to perform fully, and then some. Didn't have to worry about ""losing it"", and mentally I didn't feel that much different. Somehow it worked, and took the edge off of the anxiety . I have always been standoffish to weed growing up in Oklahoma. I live in Washington now where its legal, and even then i feel weird about it. But if it can give me this little glimpse of light, and life with less anxiety, well ill put all my reservations aside.

2192,Deep_Lab_6290,1613423161,"Hi guys.

Me and my partner (27) have been together for 3 years and we get the keys to the house we bought next week which is exciting, but as an anxious person Ive started overthinking about things such as ""what if it's too soon?"" ""What if people think we're crazy because we haven't lived together before?""  

As an anxious person Im not spontaneous or impulsive. I have thought and overthought buying a house together and imagined every possible scenario of things that could go wrong lol so it's not  decision we took lightly. My partner is aware of my anxiety and we have been a great team throughout this process. He's a great support and super laid back which is a good balance! He's excited and obviously I share that, but I'm nervous and a bit anxious too.

I worry about judgement from others, even though nobody has said anything negative and just seem to be happy and excited for us. Nobody seems to think it's too soon or that we have relationship doomed to fail due to us not living together before. I know that in reality nobody is batting an eyelid, but I just worry that they think we're rushing into it. I know it's silly to care about what others think. 

I'm also worried about being overwhelmed at the start which I know is natural, but we'll be so busy that I worry we won't have much down time. Like what if our families want to help and are overbearing and I get anxious cos of social distancing etc. It's a never ending saga lol! 

Up until now I've been so calm and taking things one day at a time, and I'm so proud of that as usually I find the negatives in everything and think of all possible ways things could go wrong. I think I mentally prepared myself by telling myself it's a stressful process for pretty much anyone buying a property, so I worked hard to take things in my stride.

It's frustrating that the week we get the keys that ny head is starting to fill with worry and catastrophic thoughts and the worst case scenarios. We've worked hard to get to this point as weve both been living with our parents since the pandemic began. I know we deserve this and I should be excited to get our own space after saving hard. I hate that anxiety is getting in the way of me feeling proud and excited.

2200,ItzDanDan,1613421594,"I used to have a very outgoing and extroverted life with tons of friends that I could always come to and depend on. But, after I moved countries I had trouble finding new friends at school. Hence, I slowly became introverted and depressed for the first year of my move. After this, I just sorta moved on and adapted to having no friends irl anymore. Sure I could talk to my old friends online but it just wasn't the same. To make things even worse, lockdown hit and I hit the bottom of the barrel. Not only did I have no friends, now I couldn't even go out to see new people. Trust me, I've tried to make new friends but I just can't click with anyone.  


Having to then spend basically a whole year in confinement at home I started to notice severe itching whenever I'm nervous. Whether it be a serious conversation or public spaces, I itch. It also gets worse depending on the situation. When just a little bit shaky, I get subtle itches here and there. But when I'm full on having an anxiety attack, I just can't stop itching. I asked my mother if I could go see a doctor about this, because it has never happened before and only started to happen after the move. However with mental illness being seen as taboo in my culture, she quickly said no stating that the doctor would just prescribe me drugs, or that it was just my ""allergies acting up"" when it quite obviously is not.  


I'm seriously at a loss here. I now this isn't normal and that I need to get help, but  what else can I do? Does anyone have advice or anything to help? It's tiring getting nervous at the tiniest things and having to itch like crazy above it all.

I wasn't screaming or shouting, I just became sterner with him. It was a 30 minute phone call and we kept going around in circles and if I didn't put my foot down, the conversation would have gone on a lot longer. After I took control of the call and put him in his place, his tone changed and the call finally ended. 

I have to raise a complaint on his behalf because he wasn't happy that we couldn't do what he wanted us to do. If they listen back to the call, I am worried that they are going to think I was rude to the customer because I was really stern with him. Looking back, I should have asked more questions to get more information to put in the complaint even though I know it will not change the outcome. Even if our complaints team thinks I was rude to the customer, the worst thing that can happen is that my manager pulls me to one side and tells me that I was rude and that we had to compensate the customer. I have worked in this job for a while and have had customers raise complaints against me before because I messed up and we had to compensate them and that hasn't bothered me.

I have lived in an upstairs apartment with my girlfriend and our cat for about 9 months when we started having issues. The guy below us moved in about the same time as we did, almost a year ago in April. We have never met each other, and he remains the only person in our apartment building that we don't know/can't at least say hello to!

So starting about around Christmas time, we notice that from about 4pm to 7pm, he is very particular about noises, and lets us know he is unhappy by either pounding his wall or ceiling, yelling, cursing at us, or all three. This went on for all of January until just a few days ago when I realized how much It had been bothering me, and called our landlord. The landlord called the man, who he said apologized and promised to not act in such a way anymore. (It has been only about 3 or 4 days since that phone call, so I will update this post if he starts up again).

Even though he has been reprimanded and swore to stop such intrusive behavior, I can't shake this anxious feeling I have of upsetting him, a guy I dont even know! It has gotten to the point where I am having trouble feeling comfortable and safe in my own home... 

If anyone has any advice about my situation to help me out, that would be amazing, because like I said, anxiety is very new to me, and it has quickly caused me to shut down and think of little else but this issue.

2210,Under_score2338,1613419448,"Hi. For several years I have had this thing where I apologise inside my head, sometimes hundreds of times a day, though mostly less than that. It's like a reflexive ""I'm sorry"" that's happened almost before I know it's coming. The triggers are so minor, sometimes they're so fleeting I can't even catch them, but they're all around interactions with people. Like if the postal worker delivers a package to me, the memory of that event will trigger ""I'm sorry"" probably another ten times that day. Sometimes the trigger is years ago, like the memory of forgetting my jacket at work and having to go back for it is still a frequent trigger which occurred I guess 7or 8 years ago. It's accompanied by a feeling in my chest, a sort of sharp feeling.

In many areas of life I can be really bold, I'm introverted but not socially anxious. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? Nobody I've ever spoken to about it (including therapists) has been able to suggest anything that shifts it. I can't make any sense of it.

1. Who is the best provider to get a diagnosis from (General practitioner, specialized APRN, psychologist, psychiatrist)?

2. Is there a standard procedure to follow for diagnosing mental illness/disorders? If a provider does not have you fill out a questionnaire, but asks you their own questions is that still a valid diagnosis?

3. How do I know if my diagnosis is true/valid? 

More individual question: 
I just had an appointment with a PMH-APRN as suggested my therapist. I really liked her, she asked me many questions and I feel was very thorough. She suggested that I start medication to treat my symptoms. But she didn’t specifically tell me a diagnosis, so I asked her about the diagnosis. She said that treating the symptoms is more important than the specific diagnosis, but that she thinks I have mild/moderate depression, social anxiety, and mild ocd.

Ive struggled with anxiety and depression for about half of my life.  
I always functioned in society, untill a few years ago when I suddenly one day got my first panick-attack so sewere I havent even managed to find someone experiencing something similar.  
I wont go into details ofc, since it may trigger someone, but it was like I gave birth to panick and it stuck with me.  


Since that time, I finally got some help, and ive been constantly working on myself and challenging myself.  
I have a job, a wife and a child on its way.  


However! Im struggling with theese weird flashes of anxiety that comes out of NOWHERE.  
I feel happy, im content, and im not affraid at all. But still its like my body experience the physical symptoms. And the situations I experience them are totally random.  
For example: I can speak in front of 100 people and not feel a thing.   
But I may start to shivver or get dizzy, or feel like I cant breath when im in a lovely dinner with close friends while we laugh and have fun.  


I even got major panick once because I ate some cheese, lol  
Or when getting adrenaline from a good movie  
Or even when im looking forward to something great  
You get my point  


In the start of my journey it was kinda easy, because I knew what situations triggered me: But now it just shows up randomly from totally mundane tasks. Sometimes with a month between (And then sticking for a few days).  
Sometimes I just have a bad month and I swear I can FEEL when anxiety leaves my body and I know I wont see it for a while  


How do I work with this? When its totally random? My biggest problem is the good ol ""I forgot how to breath,"" wich suddenly tunes in  
I know I most likely will prone to anxiety for the rest of my life, but it feels like Ive hit a wall.  Like I can see the sun, but the window is foggy and I cant get it off

2231,looshee,1613412452,"I have anxiety and overthinking is one of my worst vices. But recently I’ve become a little paranoid that the universe is trying to tell me something through ‘signs’ in my life. For example, I was thinking about something out of the blue and that following day at work, I saw the thing I was worrying about at least twice. Then, while reading the news I saw an article on the something I was worrying about again. So then I pushed it out of my head, I did go into anxiety mode and freak out that the universe was telling me this something i was thinking about was going to happen to me because i had seen it so often that week but after speaking to a friend I was able to forget about it temporarily. 

Fast forward another couple weeks, I see that something A LOT again. This time through the news on TV, a mobile ad and in two separate books I was reading. I'm starting to grow more paranoid at this point - “Is this the universe telling me regardless of where I go this thing is going to happen to me?” Now I’m overthinking it like hell. I feel exhausted and know its most likely my brain going into overdrive, but I have a lot of “mind traps” where I’ll quickly find a solution to my overthinking then get pulled back to square one again.  

To explain further, I have a lot of weird quirks about my worries. I'm a firm believer that everything in the Universe happens for a reason. So when something like a recurring topic comes up in my life, I’m sure its a sign of the future that this is something I’m going to deal with later in life. Even when I stop worrying, I go into this “but what if?” moment that it will still happen and I have this crazy premonition of events and that I was right all along. I know that sounds crazy, but as a kid I remember reading about a woman who was murdered by her fiancée and how she painted pictures of her death as a teenager before she even had a clue it would happen in her 30s. So when I worry about the future, just out of the blue, I'm convinced it’s the human body’s sixth sense at work. Like a predetermined destiny the universe is giving me signs of.  I also have this thing about prophetic dreams, and while I've not experienced this phenomenon I had a dream linked heavily to this 'something' I have been worrying about and now I'm doubly convinced it will occur because of this phenomenon. 

Please help me reason with my overthinking brain, my thought patterns are completely crazy and at this point I am too embarrassed to tell a friend because they’ll just find it stupid.",Anxiety,Please help!

I’m not exaggerating when I say banging. It woke up my flat mate and he came out to see what was going on. It was like a police knock.  And I was so startled and disorientated and panicking wondering what the help was happening, I thought there was an earthquake or the building was falling down (my brain can jump to some really irrational conclusions when I’m not fully with it).

This is typical of me, I find something medical to freak out about. Four years ago I thought I had a brain tumor. Two years ago I thought I had a hernia. This past year it's been anxiety about covid.

I probably don't have Parkinson's. I'm fairly young for it (35). My hands don't shake at rest, my balance is okay. I probably just have an essentially tremor.

Most often those who’ve never attempted suicide have a difficult time understanding those who have. Some believe that suicide is cowardliness or the ultimate expression of self-hate.  However, in many cases it was just the opposite. People can love themselves too much to see them suffer any longer. Imagine a desperate man hanging onto a branch above a deep crevasse. His friends watch helplessly from above encouraging him to hold on. He holds on for as long as he can ― and then longer yet. His strength eventually gives out so he falls. Afterwards, some people fault him for killing himself. In effect, what they are accusing him of is voluntarily opening his fingers to let himself fall. But what actually happened was that he just didn’t have the strength to keep his fingers closed around the branch any longer. No matter how much he wanted to live or how much his friends encouraged him he simply was not able to keep his grasp. 
By the time some people reach the point of suicide they are simply out of strength.

Based on my readings, and discussions with therapists, personal experience, and the progress i’ve been making over the years i decided to try managing anxiety without meds . 
Been off meds for almost two months now, been more anxious than with meds, and some days have been bad, but i’m trying to soldier on in attempt to tame my body. 
Would like some input from people who maybe have managed to deal with anxiety without meds. 

If you would like more details on what i’m trying to do to manage without anxiety you may read this article which greatly sums it up:

https://www.psycom.net/ease-anxiety-tips

If you’re wondering why I wish to stop meds when they were helping: 
1. Even while on meds I would sometimes get bad anxiety for a relatively short while (week or two) 
2. I would like to feel strong. I would like to feel like i’m not dependent on meds to manage anxiety. 
3. I feel that my situation is not so severe that warrants taking meds for the rest of my life. 
4. Most of the progress I have been making *I believe* was due to better understanding of what anxiety is and better responses to it when it arises and not meds. 

I’m not against meds, and u do believe they help a lot, just felt it was worth it to attempt to stop them at least once in my life.

2279,Fluid-Department-,1613402419,"I am not sure whether to post this or what sort of response I’m hoping for honestly. The other night I watched the movie I Kill Giants with my partner. (Spoilers ahead possibly?) I sobbed. The whole movie really just ended up bringing up a lot of childhood feelings that I had forgotten. Once the movie was over I thought that was it, I had cried and the movie was over, my partner and I watched something else and ate dinner. Things moved on. 

The next morning I had therapy. Near the end of my appointment my therapist asked if me and my partner were watching anything during our weekend together since we were iced inside during that time. I told her about the movie and mentioned how much I could relate to the main character, Barbara, because I was 9-10 when my mom had cancer and was going through multiple surgeries, chemo, and radiation. The main character was bullied and outcast at her school for her interests, and I went through both at the same time as well though at a little bit younger of an age. I recommended it to my therapist (as I would to most people now). She said I hadn’t talked about my childhood at all and that if I was more comfortable next week that she would love to hear more about it since I had brought up the movie.

Again. I thought that was it. The day moved on and my partner and I played Majoras Mask. We watched some more tv. Eventually we went to bed, it was late and I was exhausted. 

And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. I’m laying in bed with my partner holding me, and suddenly I’m like a broken dam and I’m just sobbing. He did what he usually does and asked if I wanted him to keep holding me or if I needed space. (I’ve had anxiety attacks that start like that too and I just can’t be touched when those happen or else I just shut down) He told me I needed to talk to him about what was going on, and I struggled to get words out. All I was focused on was calming down as a priority, not whatever had made me cry. 

Once I calmed down a bit. I talked to him. It was hard. All I could really get out was -
“Have you ever just seen or heard something that reminded you of something painful, and then after that pain has come and gone- you think it’s over... but it’s not. Because the next time you get really tired or you go to bed when the things from the day have settled. All those emotions and memories and hurt come flooding back in? Because that’s where I’m at right now.”

And he said he didn’t understand because he had never had that happen before. But he said he was there for me. He expressed that I was safe now, and that everything was okay. He just held me for the rest of the night, and occasionally offered comforting words to me and little snugs and hugs. 

As I was still calming down after having said that though I managed to get out the part that hurt the most, and that was that I didn’t have a whole lot of memories from when I was a kid. So when memories did come back, like when something triggers the memory (something I see, hear or smell are the most common for me), I just feel a lot. It was just especially distressing because they weren’t pleasant childhood memories that came back. They weren’t pleasant feelings that I was remembering. 

I just felt like a small helpless child in my partner’s arms. I felt helpless. He made sure I felt safe. He made sure I was comfortable before instinctively going to physically comforting me. He talked to me and held me until I was calm enough to talk to him. The purpose of this isn’t necessarily to point out how great and loving my partner is, but I also don’t want it to go to the wayside because I appreciate him dearly. 

Anyway. I have plans with an old friend next weekend because I wanted to talk to her about the childhood pain and what I was feeling. I know we both grew up in somewhat similar households so I wanted her perspective on some things. 

I don’t know if I want advice. I don’t know if I just wanted to get this off my chest. All I know is I still hurt a lot. And I feel absolutely ridiculous that a movie was what brought all these feelings up. I don’t know what to do besides share this and maybe someone who was also been through something similar will know what to say or will appreciate the movie.",Anxiety,On the movie I Kill Giants and dealing with childhood grief and triggers as an adult (TW),https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lkfpne/on_the_movie_i_kill_giants_and_dealing_with/,1613373619.0

2281,jphillips672,1613402077," How can you reach a level of discomfort that in the end leads to comfort?  


For  me at the beginning I started with things that would trigger my  anxiety. There were so many things in my life that I was scared of  because I knew my anxiety would take over and keep me from living a life  that was actually worth living. Anxiety kept me from traveling, working  out, going on dates, school, certain jobs, meeting new people, and even  driving my own car to the grocery store. I lived a sheltered life  because the fear that was placed inside me. I lost jobs, dropped out of  school, lost friends, built up debt, and continuously made bad eating  and health choices because it’s all I knew. There was a point in my life  where I had had enough and the thought of giving up or even suicide was  the only way out.  


Was I ever wrong!  


I am still so far  from where I want to be, but where I am now is a 180 turn from where I  was 6 years ago. I found that bringing discomfort into my life was the  strongest medicine for my brain to heal and overcome the doubts I had in  my life. The first time I had ever left the country was going to India  alone for a month. Talk about discomfort. I slowly drove my car farther  and farther each day to the point where I can now sit in California  traffic with very little anxiety. I am now a yoga instructor when years  ago I would have a panic attack in every class I went to, but I kept  going back because each time I became closer to overcoming the fear. I  continuously push through hard workouts even when I feel I’m going to  die because I know it’s only my brain showing me my weaknesses.  


It’s  a slow and steady pace to overcome fears and insecurities, but I can  tell you that sitting your ass on the couch watching bullshit CNN isn’t  going to do it for you. The only way is hard work. Whether you start by  walking one mile each day, getting through a 2 hour flight, hiring a  personal trainer, playing chess, meditation, or whatever brings hardship  into your life so you can get to the point of YOUR success.

2284,helpneededtemp123,1613401463,"Repost from r/therapy idk if this is allowed I just generally need help and this is somewhat related to anxiety (only thing I know for sure I have a problem with)

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much that I want to vent into the void so here I am on a temporary account.

I am 14 (m) and so much just feels wrong. For as long as I can remember, I have had this huge aversion to trying foods. I have dismissed it saying that I'm just a picky eater and I'll grow out of it, but it is really affecting me. I get a huge amount of anxiety when I am asked to try a new food, and often that just ruins the food. I have a small diet which is ok at home because my parents generally help me but combine that with my celiac (no gluten) and it is hell for me to go out with friends. I have wanted to go out with friends so much and I just can't because they are like, ""wanna go out for lunch/dinner"" and I know I won't eat anything and I'll just feel bad. Anyways onto the other stuff.

I saw some stupid urban legend when I was 8 and it scared me, and now I literally cannot sleep without my bathroom door closed. Whenever I try to, I just can't. It's not that I prefer it, it is that if I see the open bathroom door I \*need\* to close it before turning off the lights. Another sleep related thing is if I go to sleep too early and have too much energy, I will start spiraling and thinking about how I will probably be killed in my sleep (I am in a very safe country and there is no risk), and part of that is being shot through the window (no guns) so I \*need\* to have my blinds fully closed so no potential sniper assasain (idek) can see me \[insert eye roll emoji here\].

Now onto the social anxiety/general social issues. I am unable to ask for things. Any time I ask my parents for something of value, I am so immensely afraid they will say no or they will be mad or something that I have to send it over WhatsApp. I draft it in the messages I have with myself (quite useful for quick notes tbh) and then copy it into the message box and press send and quickly close the window and do something else so the stress goes away. Also, I find it hard to say no. My parents asked me where I wanted to go, and they said places I wouldn't ever want to go for fun and I kept shrugging my shoulders. I found it hard to say no. I just couldn't say no, but I was able to affirm that my shrugs meant a no when they asked so yay? Now to the weird behavioral things. I (can't control this) overanalyze things to the point where I annoy people. I was watching The Martian with my dad and had to interject every few minutes about something I found interesting or wondered about. I realized it was annoying him so I tried to stop but I couldn't. There have also been times where my sister (we don't have a good relationship because idk but it's getting better) has gotten annoyed with me for doing things like this.

Just a misc mental thing here: whenever one of my issues comes up in my head, I immediately dismiss it as me faking it and just doing it intentionally subconciously. I also think a lot that my friends hate me. I have gotten ok at saying no to this voice but a constant doubt is really annoying and I hate it. An example of when this happens is sometimes I will be lying in bed and randomly tense up a muscle and jerk, and this got really bad to the point that chatting with people would be filled with typos because of this, but I always assume I am doing it myself deliberately.

Emotions. I do have a therapist (who is bad for reasons that will be mentioned later, also, now that I think of it, if I forget to put in any to be mentioned laters, tell me because things are slipping out of my mind rn), but we never get anything done. Whenever he asks me about an emotion or how I feel, I often just sit there, not knowing what to say. I don't often know my emotions especially when I'm in therapy. Sometimes I will say something felt good but he is always like ""elaborate"" when I really can't. I don't know anything beyond good and it is really annoying because he pesters me about it.

Therapist. He is terrible. He gave me some anxiety test thing in June, hasn't mentioned it, though this isn't that bad. But the minor gas lighting is where it is bad. Once he gave me this ball that had a chunk taken out of and I played with it for a week, and a couple weeks later, he blames me for it and doesn't act like he was just joking. He jokingly says that everything that breaks is my fault, and he even said something completely false that I unknitted a knitted thing (if it happened and I forgot about it that's a different issue). It's really annoying and it isn't joking because I keep telling him the truth that HE HIMSELF TOLD ME when he gave me the ball, but he doesn't believe me. I can't get rid of him because see social anxiety paragraph and also because me and my sister have useful joint sessions together and if I switch it would require her to switch to someone else at the new place I go to and I don't want to inconvenience her too much. Another thing that happened is one time when I was staring at the ceiling, I saw something weird on the AC. Basically there were these lines (kinda dark idk) that were coming out of the AC, and they curved slightly down to the exact place where a box of kleenex was blowing in the exact direction the lines were facing. It was as if I could see air and it was so weird. I tell him about it and he says that ""you're going bonkers"" and jokes it off. I felt like I was going crazy that day because it went away immediately and I still don't know what happened.

I also eat slow, and the therapist says I do it so I can have more attention and more time with my family which I just see as.... wrong. I want to eat faster and to say I do it so I can have more attention from my family just seems wrong to say but idk.

Anyways this was an off my chest kinda vent and I am not looking for anything in particular, I just \*needed\* to put this all somewhere.",Anxiety,I just.... need help. Am I crazy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lkfeid/i_just_need_help_am_i_crazy/,1613372663.0

My anxiety issues should've been handled ages ago but they didn't due to circumstances. When I did try to seek help it got brushed off or it simply got overlooked. At this point my anxiety has fully taken over my life and enabled me on every aspect possible. I get occasional terrifying panic attacks and when I don't get panic attacks, I'm stuck dealing with muscle tremors due to my racing thoughts. My stress levels are so high and out of the ordinary that I tend to get daily nose bleeds because I tend to get so worked up inside of my head. I have a bunch of other vague symptoms as well and it's honestly driving me to the brink of insanity. It's hell and it makes me feel like a hopeless case.

2289,misscharliebond,1613399828,"Hi Reddit,  
So, for background, I am not generally an anxious person. I do have misophonia and hyperacusis, which means sharp sounds for me can really set me on edge. I have quite a bit of background traumas, but I've gotten on with my life and I don't believe they are related to my current situation:  
I live in a very small open plan flat with my boyfriend, which is basically one small room, and a \*tiny\* separate bedroom and tiny toilet. We cannot afford to move somewhere bigger right now.  
Myself and my partner own a business together, where we used to go to work, however due to the pandemic and current UK lockdown, we have digitised and now must operate from home. It's going great, and we have a really healthy personal relationship alongside our working relationship. It's pretty good, and I count myself so lucky to be here. Generally I can sit and work quietly in peace whilst he works too, but then sometimes when we are discussing an idea for the business, or if he gets a phone call, he stands up, and paces the room, which can throw me from being zen and happy and feeling productive, into on the cusp of a full-blown panic attack.   
I don't know why I'm like this. But I feel everything in my body tense up, I feel nausea, I get twitchy legs and my whole calm, productive mood is completely ruined. My heart pounds. I immediately need the toilet. I want to cry. I start picking at wounds, spots, dry skin - almost obsessively. Just because he is having a little walk around whilst he arranges his thoughts. I feel so silly.  


I know that the pandemic and lockdown situation has created a pressure-cooker environment for so many people, and I'm sure this is a symptom of that, but when I try to talk to him about it, I just freak out and babble and my mouth cannot find the words to say I feel like a stranger near to him and it makes me panic.   


I also really do not want him to feel uncomfortable, like he cannot do what he wants in his own home. I know he feels like he needs to pace to help think. I don't want him to do something which negatively affects his work.   


It's not a case of being able to move to a different room - the bedroom is so small that it literally only fits our bed and a wardrobe, and I can't really lie on the bed to work, otherwise I'd spend the whole day and night in there, I'm not sure it's healthy either.  


Is there a way I can explain this to him, or a solution to help make things easier whilst we're both working from home like this? I can't foresee that situation changing much soon, especially now we've digitised the business. I'd really appreciate any thoughts on how to at least have the conversation, which doesn't end in me flapping like a crazed chicken and ultimately crying because I can't express what I'm feeling exactly.

At first I enjoyed school because I was furloughed and classes were remote. Now I’m back at work, with student teaching, and remote classes at night. 
I’ve been having a hard time managing everything. I do every to try and help myself; if I’m not organized, I spiral. 
This weekend, I had another meltdown. I feel like everything is overwhelming me and I don’t know how to help myself. Hot yoga was my release before the pandemic. Now some studios are back open but I do not have the time or money to go (I tried yoga at home and it’s not the same to me).

2297,Thought-I-lost-it,1613394849,"While there's so much more to say about it, I will try to make it brief.
TL;DR - looking for new form of therapy. Something else than cognitive behavioural therapy. 

Tomorrow is my last appointment with my psychologist. And while I'm not there yet, and we both get along really well, it's sadly time to move on.
We started working together in may 2019, so almost two years ago. But he doesn't have the tools nor the (organisation's) support to help me. 
The intention was to get psycho diagnostic rapport about my whole situation and start with a multiple disciplines approach. But that didn't quite work out. Due to various reasons (sickness, change of diagnostic trainer) it took quite a long time to get that report. The result is that according to DSM5 my complaints are part of the autism spectrum instead of anxiety. I had a hard time accepting the fact that I'm autistic, and I don't know why. Plus, it really opened any doors. I got psycho education, but that was just like cognitive behavioural therapy.
The thing is, at the age of 26 I started at the organisation I'm at 'til tomorrow.
The idea was s multiple disciplined approach to get more things done. 

What I was hoping for was like some sort of timetable with different subjects so to say.
My whole life I've been suffering from my generalized anxiety disorder. Since the age of 9th various kinds of therapy started and over the years I sort of learned to cope with it at times. But there was always a fallback lurking in the dark. If I would commit to a exposure in vivo, but was tired, didn't sleep well and too worried chances were I failed to get through it, and that would make me so upset and make me lose the little self confidence I would have. 

I was thinking about CGT for an hour, then an hour meditation or yoga, then an hour sort of positive awareness drill, an hour talking sbout diet, sn hour of sports. Something like that. Such a multiple disciplines approach.
But we got stuck at CGT and system (family) therapy. And other forms that I wanted weren't supported at the organisation.

(Besides that, I know a lot about CGT, and I'm looking for something at the source, the root of sll negativity eithin me, while CGT is more like how to deal with your problem, what too rhink, what to ask yourself snd how to reduce your worrying) 

The anxiety, negativity is carved so deep in myself. I just can't take compliments, I just wave away positive feedback, or define another source for the success, always blame myself, I'm scared before I know it, I seem to have broken myself enough in not to enjoy life at all.
Still, there's a bit of strength left to keep fighting.
In my other posts I talked about the age of 27 obsession, right now im a few months shy for 29. So I failed that goal. Now I need to fix things,turn things around snd write a succes story. Crave new lines and paths. Commit to positive belief. 

I want to be the best version I can be of myself.
But I just don't know how to get there...
What could help me?
Acceptance &amp; Commitment -, schema-, contextual -, gestalt - or teansactional therapy?

Beside the cognitive part, I'm also taking antidepressants. 300mg venlafaxin, 450 bupropion, 3mg lorazepam, 1mg aripiprazol, thyroid medication, vitamin D.
But that's a thing I want to change later,when I'm a little bit more confident snd found a doctor that makes me feel acknowledged and trusted.",Anxiety,Where to go to now?

2311,Leonardo_Schoen,1613387509,"Hi there. Right now I am facing one of most difficult time in my life related to work anxiety. I have constant imposter syndrome and fear to loose my job. It all started when I got my promotion which I always wanted. I am working almost 4 years in franchise based company where my coworkers are working for 10-20+ years. Everyone knows each other and loyalty is very important here. It's difficult to get a job here without any inside recommendation, but I did. One of the problem here is communication, at the beginning I did try to fit in, but eventually I realized that we don't really have anything in common. So I did tried to look for our similarity instead of differences,but our communication became even more artificial. So I stopped trying, I did my job well till I become highly valueted employee. Got the respect from my colegues and first time in my life felt extremely safe in my workplace but burned out inside from a workload . The good thing was that i didint need to communicate with my colegues if I didint whant to, but in my new role we have to communicate on daily basis and it feels that worsens my imposter syndrome . I have to admit I got promotion because my close colleague and I decided that is a time to quit at the same time when our colegues from a better position did. And management had to decide witch one they whant to keep, they choose me, even though I saw my colegue as more quilified. So I tried to put as much effort as I can but at the same time my anxiety  become severe, eventually with a help of my wife I pushed myself to visit psichologist for a first time in my life. And we started to work on this issue, and I realised that   I had this anxiety as far as I can remember, but always thought that it was some kind of period of my life and eventually it will go away. My bigest fear at his point that right now I am in the middle of very important decision of my life, my wife and I decided to take loan on mortgage. I always wanted to have my own  home, but I always tried to delay the application process because I hoped to become more financially stable or start to feel more safe at the workplace. But eventually I did realise that there is nothing to wait or anithing to delay. This how its probably going to be up untill the rest of my life. This constant fear of loosing your job gives me extreme anxiety, so I have to push myself to do my job, but does anyone when something like this before?

2315,bakingtofu,1613386907,"Hi, hope everyone’s been doing good and treating themselves well. 

I’ve been feeling anxious lately, more than usual. In the past weeks i’ve been having dreams about being in high school again. I’m already 24 and don’t want to keep dreaming about my high school days. I don’t want to relieve high school again nor think about it, let alone dream about it 3 times a week. My high school dreams are so absurd, it usually deals with how I’ve changed and all my classmates have noticed and have noticed how different i am. Yet, i still somehow feel anxious in the dream, almost like I want approval from these people, who quite frankly, I don’t give a flying frick about.

I’m thinking it stems from the insecurity I felt back in high school. And even to this day, I’m still insecure about myself. It makes me feel anxious, and I can’t stop thinking about how people think of me. It sucks because I know deep down I don’t care what people think of me, yet I still do in a way.

Here’s a little backstory: i’ve never been the most confident person growing up. During high school, I really wanted to fit in, and of course i never felt pretty at all. I didn’t get bullied or anything, but i definitely was not considered popular and was treated less better than the “popular kids” by certain teachers and the other kids, because I wasn’t social or outgoing. And there were times when it was obvious the “popular kids” didn’t want to go as far as be friends with me, or even be friendly. 

I spent 4 years of high school wishing I could be friends with the “popular kids” if only I was “prettier” or more outgoing. But I was not, I was that shy and introverted girl in class. 

After high school, my confidence grew. I enjoyed college, and loved how nobody in college gave a shit about your status or whether you were popular or not. Everyone was there to get their bachelor’s, not form cliques. I made great friends and never felt left out in college. I also got more into makeup (falsies, eyeshadow &amp; lipstick, etc.) and was finding my style all throughout college. 

I did notice that caught people’s attention because I blossomed and became “pretty” due to makeup and a better fashion sense. I also realized during that time that I genuinely do enjoy makeup and trying new clothing styles, not because I want to impress anyone. Yet, I can’t help thinking that no one would treat me the way they do now if it wasn’t for all that makeup and the way I dress now. 

On Instagram, I only put the best version of myself on my page. I don’t like that at all. I don’t feel real. It’s just all makeup and curated styles. 
I can’t even post my bare face on instagram without feeling like my followers would judge me. This cycles back to my insecurity about how I look, and feeling like people will judge me for not looking the way I do with all the makeup. 
And most of all, I hate how I feel without makeup. Makeup is my safe space and I feel like I’m just hiding behind it. I also start to get anxious when I see people from my high school following my instagram. 

One of my old high school friends followed me the other day, and I followed her back. The first thing she messaged me saying was how different I looked from my high school days, and that she almost didn’t recognize me. 

Now all I think about when a former high school classmate follows my ig is how different I look. I no longer look like that quiet, introverted girl that they knew in high school. 

This also triggers certain thoughts when I see old hs classmates following me. Certain thoughts such as: Why do you even bother following me when we were never friends in high school? You were the same person who didn’t want to befriend me because I was too shy, and not “pretty” enough. When I think of these thoughts, I get anxious and annoyed. And I start to get disgusted with my high school classmates &amp; any thoughts of my high school days. 

I’m now wondering if this is why I keep having dreams about current me being back in high school. Sigh. I just want to stop having these dreams. 

Sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to vent this all out somewhere. :)

So I have Gastritis attacks for a few months now (though my health anxiety definitely says cancer), and  though I'm already used to these attacks since I've had them since I was in high school (abdominal pain, bloating, nausea), lately they got more frequent and a lot worse ever since I ate sweets for a week straight. But what annoys me about these attacks is that now I get super tense before eating and I get so hyper aware of my stomach that I already anticipate that I will bloat and get nauseous, making me panic even more (I'm also emetophobic btw). 

I can handle the stomach pain and heartburn just fine since I'm taking medications to make it go away but it's the bloating, nausea, and really the anxiety that's making this difficult for me. It's like even if my stomach is already fine and I can eat normally, just the slightest panic or even anticipation can escalate it into a full-blown panic attack. This already happened before, but now I get it all the time, most of it at home but the worst attacks I get is when I eat outside. Now I'm afraid I might get a fear of eating out or with other people (especially having a panic attack in front of my friends), and that this anxiety before and after eating will never go away :(

Any advice on how to get through this? I probably had these attacks more than twice a day for the past week, and I'm already at my wits end :(",Anxiety,Gastritis and Anxiety are ruining my life!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lkawgx/gastritis_and_anxiety_are_ruining_my_life/,1613355765.0

basically it has me feeling like a prisoner in my own mind. i’m terrified of sleep so eventually my body just crashes for 12+ hours. rinse, repeat. i have 0 energy. i’ve gained about 65 pounds since then and am now a 278 pound female who is turning 26 in a week. i’ve been in therapy and it definitely helps. but with everything going on in the world, barely working because of covid-restrictions (i’m a waitress) i feel like this is it. i know i am very young and possibly sound ridiculous to be this existential, but the intense fear of dying/thinking i’m dying every single day for almost 4 years has turned my life into a nightmare.

I was not comfortable around my father too. I used to sit inside the room and stopped socializing. I was so anxious even to say hi. I used to be the class lead, now struggled to speak or look in the eyes and speak. I had nothing to do so I started studying hard. Even got gold medal continuously for 5 years. I was very beautiful ( I'm not exaggerating, no one belives me if show my old pictures). I was the school topper. But I got chicken pox and had scars all the face. This was the end of my social life.

To scared to even walk outside your door, because anxiety puts stupid scenarios in your head. You had no sleep at all, your legs are twitching and your eyes are burning from staring at your phone the whole night. Your mental health is getting really bad, you skipped your meds, cause you were too depressed to even take them. Every time you hear a noise you pretend that you are sleeping to avoid any eye or social contact with anyone. 

You strive on impulsive decisions. You hide behind the curtains of substance abuse. You don’t have a vision for your life. You use to dream so big when you were young, but now you have nothing left - no motivation, no passion, no ideas, no heart and “comfortably” living your best broke life. 

Fuck I even felt sorry for people not having my ambition when i was young. It’s CRAZY how time will change you even if you don’t want to be changed. If you don’t have an image, the lack of image becomes the image. 

For anyone who’s feeling down, sick or suicidal.

2350,flossdraken,1613369428,"I've been paralysed by anxiety for the entire week since I received an offer for a data scientist traineeship role. I'm a fresh social science grad with no math background and only some programming experience from an introductory DS class. During the interview I got blind-sided by technical questions, answering all but one incorrectly. The interviewers seemed unimpressed so it was very awkward, though I felt relieved after flunking the interview as I always do. But the next morning HR called me saying I got the job. I had a panic attack upon receiving the news. Did they make a mistake? Did they have an inflated impression of my actual abilities? The lady sensed my lack of excitement but gave me some time to decide. I threw up not long after the call ended, and I haven't been myself ever since. Each day i've been obsessing over whether to accept it. Physically, I've been finding it difficult to move and to keep food down. Today is the deadline.

I get super anxious about anything job-related. It doesn't help that my past internship/part-time work experiences were rather unpleasant. I was isolated by coworkers and mistreated by my supervisors. But beyond the fears about the work environment, I feel extremely vulnerable in this role. I know none of the languages/software used, and was told by the lead that i'm expected to pick them up fast. Sounds like a lot of pressure and things could get ugly if I don't meet the mark.

Then there's the dicey-ness of having to ask for days off early in my traineeship without divulging the actual reason if my previous application for a government job moves to the next stage. The recruitment process is competitive and protracted, so it will be more than once if I make it through each round. 

On the positive side, I guess this is a rare opportunity for me to dip my toes into data science proper especially since I have some interest in it. Other similar openings require relevant qualifications. This organisation is also a reputable one. I'm also technically allowed to quit at any time, though I find it hard to internalise this fine print and it probably isn't nice.

The few people i've asked have given me simplistic yet opposing advice: just yolo and take it vs. don't risk it if you're not confident and hold out for a full-time job. There's only a few hours left so I will probably accept the offer right before the deadline, not knowing if it's out of fear/external pressures or intrinsic motivations. Nor do I know how i'm going to cope with everything that will unfold after I hit send. I can't stop thinking about the ways it could go wrong.

I feel quite alone with my anxiety. I guess I needed someone to hear me out and perhaps give me some advice on dealing with the psychological torment.

2354,dpena63,1613368771,"Hello,

I'm writing to ask if anyone has experienced anything similar..

I haven't really had anxiety for a few years now, until the past few weeks. I had a couple big panic attacks in 2014 and it took about 10 months before I felt relatively normal, though since then things like visual snow and a few other weird things remained. Something slight has just felt off since, I don't often pay attention to it and overall I'm quite well.

When I was younger (currently 25) I could down coffee all day and would barely even notice the caffeine. Since this anxiety episode in 2014 I can't tolerate coffee, maybe a sip or 2, otherwise my focus is trashed and after a few more sips anxiety spikes. 

I'm experiencing the same thing now with alcohol. I rarely drink (1-2x/month) but just lately I notice I'll have a beer or 2 and when the descent occurs I'll quickly feel 'off'. 

It's been awhile since I experienced anxiety, I forgot how weird it all is. I've been seeing a therapist for about 1 year (though I haven't experienced anxiety throughout). The anxiety is over nothing I can point to either, I'll just start to feel anxious and then things will feel suddenly a bit too bright, too loud, too stimulating and I'll feel anxious about the most random things and then I'll get particularly anxious that I'm going crazy or losing my mind.

Anyway. I realize this was a bit all over the place but I'm assuming all this time I probably didn't 'get rid of' my anxiety like I thought I had, I suspect these past years of 'something slight feels off' is quite associated with why caffeine throws me off.

Do I have a question? Yes. Has anyone else gotten out the other side and just felt generally more robust to things like caffeine, alcohol, stress? Any comments really would be appreciated, I forgot how terrible anxiety feels and mostly looking for reassurance.

Hey everyone, so I know this is a common topic/issue that a lot of people deal with. However, I haven't been able to find any solid info on Reddit or Google pertaining to how to help the situation. 

Long story short, I've dealt with anxiety and depression most of my life, starting around age 15-16. (I'm 27 now) Around age 23 I finally got things under control, graduated college and was able to afford therapy, etc. 

So I've been dating my current boyfriend for nearly 3 years and we have always had a great relationship. Over the last year or so I have been way more open with him about what I'm going through. I finally told him I'm in therapy and some of my issues, all that. 

We are both ICU respiratory therapists FYI, so obviously things have been really difficult for us, like everyone. I had been doing much better, but recently started to have panic attacks again, which I hadn't had one for over 6 months prior to the last two months. Then I had one last month, and then I had one yesterday. And suddenly he is very unsupportive and was almost angry. He was saying things like ""you know that's nothing to be worried about"" (true, it wasn't) ""just stop thinking about it"" and ""get over it, there's no reason to cry"" those things were all true. The panic attack was over something so ridiculous, and I know that. But anyone who has anxiety and panic attacks knows, sometimes the weirdest things will trigger you into oblivion. 

I tried explaining this to him. Telling him ""You don't deal with anxiety so I wouldn't expect you to understand, but I want you to be supportive and know that it's not just something I can turn on and off"" but that made him more angry. 

I'm really upset over this whole situation. He's always been so supportive and I don't know how to deal with making him realize it's not something I can just -poof! gone! All better now! I wish but that's not how it goes lol. 

So if anyone has any tips that would be great?

I’m currently laying in bed with my two kids and husband. Everyone is sleeping but me. Today was hard. I’ve had more rough days than not lately. 

I didn’t always have anxiety, at least I didn’t realize that I did. There were signs of course. I never experienced a panic attack until after my first born (who is now 2.5 almost). I remember I was cooking dinner and thought wow I’m really jittery. Then I sat down to eat and lost my vision in one eye which ended with me in a full blown panic attack on the floor, calling my brother and thinking I’m dying. After 20 minutes it passed and I was thankful. It happened again once or twice over the next month or two. Then it stopped for months. About 8 months later I started to have them again but this time it was different, it was 24/7 dizziness and my head felt weird, like I was in a dream state for 2 weeks. I would cry at dinner because I felt so out of sorts, I’d get in the car and my arms would go numb. It was like I was stuck in a panic attack all the time. The lighting in my house would constantly need to be adjusted so I could try to shake off how I felt. It was so weird. Then it vanished, I got pregnant again and my pregnancy went well, then my 2nd  was born and it started again. For weeks I was stuck in this fogged state where reality didn’t feel like reality. I would have panic attacks at night and I would have to lay down and suffer through them. The jitters, the numbness, the shaking and dizziness. Then I started having heart palpitations and weird things during the day. I feel like it’s insane that anxiety can cause me to experience all of this. Which of course causes me to experience health anxiety. I constantly think something is wrong with me. 

I’m struggling half of the time to get through the day. Every time I have a bout of this, my entire body feels bad, I feel ill, I get extremely nauseous and have to use the bathroom. I’ve puked a few times during these episodes. I’m so scared it’s more than anxiety and it’s something more. 

The longer that I deal with this I start to realize I’m struggling and what I’m dealing with isn’t normal. That  it’s not normal to feel the way I do. Sometimes I’m so tired I don’t want to get out of bed. I am up a lot with the babies in the night so I don’t get adequate and uninterrupted sleep ever. I constantly worry. Like all the time. It’s excessive and I don’t know how to stop constantly worrying about everything all day everyday.  I want to get my health checked and talk to a doctor. But I don’t want medication, I am nursing and I’m very adamant on not taking anything while I nurse. I probably sound like I’m all over the board. I just needed to vent.

My initial thought went to schizophrenia but I don’t display any symptoms of that. It has scared me and I feel so alone. My husband is mad and hasn’t checked on me but one time. I googled checking into a hospital, but now that I’ve calmed and am farther from the situation I don’t believe that to be the best option.

I like the way I look, my face and my body, love it even! I feel confident and attractive. But I’m insecure about anything that requires movement. Dancing, sports, even playing catch. 

I never played sports growing up at all. I didn’t even learn to swim until I was 12 or ride a bike until 13. It wasn’t by my own choice, my divorced parents used their children as a pawn and it’s a long story. I wasn’t allowed to join teams or anything like that. 

I want to say that’s why, and I’m sure it contributed, but I don’t think that’s the root of it. I have a really clear memory from when I was around 4-5 of my family all kicking a soccer ball around and asking me to join, and being totally resistant. I remember I wanted to but just absolutely could not. 

I want to do all these things, and always have, so it’s not like I just hate sports. I want to go skating with my friends even if I suck. I want to dance when we go out together. But last time we got together and had a few drinks, when people started dancing, I pretended I was tired and went home. 

I can’t describe the feeling. My muscles get tight and my body just curls in. I don’t like this and I want to feel confident doing these things. I have no idea why, I feel like I’ll look stupid somehow but that doesn’t feel like it even describes it right. When I see other people do it, even when they suck, I think nothing of the sort about them. My body just fights me and it always has. Gym class was my worst nightmare!

I love yoga but I can only do it in my room alone. When I’m home alone getting ready I dance to music regularly. I don’t feel restrained at all. But once I’m around people I shut down.

If its not depression, its anxiety and sometimes you wish you could switch them, cuz depression at least softens you and makes you enjoy a lot the dark side, but anxiety hypes you up - the story of my life, my yin and yang. 

Life became real, when 3 years ago my 10 year old sister was diagnosed with leukemia. To really make the story short, 2 years later she had a relapse and the diagnose was terminal. Me and my father, had to take care of her from the moment she was sent home from the hospital, to die. 

Dudes, when you're taking care of your dying sister one day is like 99 hours. And after 3 weeks I was able to say goodbye to my cutie. 

To make shit heavier, 5 days later I move to a new country to do some studies, and then COVID and panic hits. 

I returned to my country and my mom have had 5 mini-strokes who not only depressed her as fuckkkkkk but left her with eye damage and she is not able to walk alone, or without a chair. 

Then - this dude 30M, completely destroyed, breaks up with his gf, who I lived with - and thats like the only part of the story which is not sad, cuz she was very very very toxic and Im fully voided now. 

It's been a month since Im living again by myself, which Ive always loved, but anxiety and all of his rounds keep me daily at the verge of the I don't know what else. 

I feel completely voided and if I´,m filled with something is with anxiety and depression

But I stopped my 10mg Cipralex (lexapro) 3 months ago, and ever since then as the meds have made their way out of my system, I just feel more and more distant from everything.

But talking to my friends - that I've been close with and texting almost everyday for a the past year - has been hard, and I feel like I have nothing to say or am just very boring, I like have no humour like I once had before.

But I was like this - distant - before I started medications 3 years ago too. Just found it hard to relate, talk in general and carry on conversations because I felt so distant from everything. Sometimes I was ok, and at my best when I could be cheerful and energetic, but most times I struggled. I avoided a lot of social situations, kind of still do... But on medications I felt like that distance was removed and I was able to do things easier. I'll bring this up to my dr at my next appt, but she's a general physician and not a psychiatrist so I'm not sure if she'll know what to say.

2389,Raining-extinction,1613358095,"So I really need to vent but I’m also in need of some life/career advice. I’m 22 and my family have been giving me a really difficult time recently for not working. I finished uni in 2019 and I was in a very dark place throughout my studies. My GP told me at the time I should take a year out to work on my mental health. I’ve never been able to discuss my mental health issues properly with my family because every time I try they dismiss/minimise my feelings or essentially start saying I’ll never get anywhere in life if I don’t pull myself together. I did decide to tell them what my doctor had said because I thought I really needed a break at the time but they persuaded me not to take any time out. I ended up struggling through the rest of my course and scraping a 2:1. After finishing my course I desperately needed a break. I didn’t have many friends in the city I had moved to for uni so my plans were to push myself out of my comfort zone and join clubs/groups to try and make friends and also start seeing a doctor/therapist again to work on my mental health before I started looking for jobs. I did manage to achieve some things in this time however everything fell apart starting in late February 2020. I went on holiday abroad with 2 of my friends which was a massive thing for me. I’m visually impaired so new environments/travelling always make me nervous and I had never gone abroad without my family before. I was relying heavily on my friends throughout the trip to know where we were going and I was terrified of getting lost in a different country on my own and not being able to find my way back to the hotel. I also really struggle with social anxiety and generalised anxiety so I thought I had made good progress with pushing myself to go on this trip! 2 days into the trip I had all the money I had brought, my debit cards, my phone and my apartment keys for back in the UK stolen. At this point I had a complete breakdown and wanted to go home immediately, I no longer felt safe and felt like I was a massive walking target because I am visually impaired. As I couldn’t get into my apartment when I first arrived back in the UK because my keys had been stolen I went to stay with my family. It really affected me more than I expected so I stayed with my family longer than planned and then lockdown happened. At this point it made more sense to stay with my family rather than being stuck inside on my own 24/7. During lockdown my grandmother came to stay with us as she wasn’t able to live on her own anymore due to dementia. My mum still needed to work so I looked after her in the day. My mum also had 2 operations last year which meant she was off work for 6 weeks after each surgery, so for both of those 6 weeks I was helping care for her too! So I effectively spent last year caring for family members. It was very upsetting watching my grandmother become more confused. And it was very stressful having to care for my mum at times too as well as having to adapt to lockdown life like everyone else. Working was the last thing on my mind, my priority was just looking after my family and making sure we were all safe. Sadly my grandmother passed away last month so I’m no longer caring for any family. My wider family did question me last year about jobs however now I’m not caring their questioning has become a lot more intense. I’ve been in a really bad place this past month and haven’t thought about jobs at all, in fact I’m feeling worse day by day. I currently feel like the family failure/embarrassment. I’m aware it doesn’t look good that I finished uni in 2019 and still don’t have a job a year and a half later and I’m extremely anxious for the future and whether anyone will employ me and if they do, if I’ll even be capable of holding down a job. When it comes to jobs I have had some horrible experiences due to being visually impaired. I’ve been bullied and discriminated against in past workplaces which only worsened my anxiety. My mental health is still terrible and I really did want to try and improve it before applying for jobs so there’s a lower chance of me becoming overwhelmed/feeling worse and wanting to give up entirely, but with how much pressure my family is putting on me to find a job and how sarcastic and mean they can be when talking about it, I no longer think this is an option. It’s impossible to get a GP appointment in my area for mental health issues and in person therapy isn’t available at the moment with covid and I wouldn’t feel comfortable with my family hearing me talk to a therapist on the phone. Because of this I have no idea how long it will be until I can receive some professional help for my mental health so I feel like I can’t wait any longer. It’s getting to the point where I actively avoid talking or seeing my wider family because their constant questioning and mocking of me is making my social anxiety worse. It’s not a nice way to live, it’s one thing to be socially anxious around strangers but now I’m too socially anxious to even speak to my own family. It’s been such a terrible year and even though I’m still really struggling I think having something to focus on during the day might be helpful for me. So my current thoughts are this; If I was to get a job I would want a home based job where I can set up all my equipment in a way that is accessible for me without having to constantly explain/justify why I need to make certain adjustments. My social anxiety is also so severe at the moment that I rarely feel able to leave my house. So if I did get a home based job I’d want something where I have very very limited phone calls with people. I would want my main contact with people to be through email. I would also want something which is long term so not one off/freelance work and to be able to earn a liveable wage doing it. I do have other health conditions/disabilities but these are what I struggle with the most. So I guess I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions of job roles that would fit this criteria? And if anyone has any advice for explaining my year and a half gap in employment to potential employers that would be helpful! Also any tips or advice for dealing with social anxiety and trying to improve it (especially during lockdown when therapy isn’t accessible)/explaining it to family who don’t even try to understand would be very much appreciated!

2390,AstronomicalArtisan,1613357865,"I struggle to cope with generalized anxiety and am not medicated for it. My last doctor kept switching my medications due to my terrible sleep pattern, and he thought the medication was the problem, so he switched it without much verbal notice to me- had to learn about it from my former therapist that he discontinued its use and prescribed me with something different for SLEEPING. Not for anxiety, just for sleeping... The new medication gave bad side effects, but he urged me to keep taking it even after a month. Things felt worse. I just felt nonhuman and could barely function because of overwhelming anxiety, inability to sleep, etc., so I stopped bothering to see him, the therapist, and taking the medicine. I just felt that I could manage it on my own and use what I've already established to cope, even though it's difficult. It was working for a time, but lately it has just been worse for no particular reason. I'm managing myself fine, usually. I'm keeping up with my hygiene, my bedroom tidy, getting work assignments done on time, trying to fix my life, and more to stay on my feet. My boyfriend started back up with his studies in college, so I've been lonely and out of my usual routine where we hung out for hours nonstop. I'm learning to deal with it and find things to occupy myself. We had a talk about how being out of that routine was effecting me, but I support his prioritizing to study and encourage it. Things felt fine, although the feels of anxiety never subsided..

 I went to a store yesterday with my Nana.. It was a bit overcrowded. I felt hot and cold at the same time, unable to make decisions of what I wanted to buy because I felt rushed. People kept bumping into me in the narrow aisles, which I hate being touched by other people unless I'm close with them, so it really added. I kept putting things down in other spots in different aisles over because I couldn't make up my mind, would go back to the same aisle to look at similar things, pick different stuff up, etc. I just couldn't make up my mind for anything. I am pretty sure I was being watched because my behavior was really odd, and I felt hopeless and spacing out. I saw my Nana leaving the store after check out and still couldn't make up my mind of what I wanted to get for a snack for later or just buying anything at all, ended up dropping my basket on a shelf, and left the store immediately. The air was cold, so it felt a little nice, but I followed her back to the car and got in and just broke down in panic. I can't even explain why either.. it was the first time she witnessed my anxiety get that bad in public, but normally I'm fine in those similar circumstances. Ever since, I've just been feeling off, kind of dull, a bit on the depressed side, and like I just want to cry for no reason. 😪 I can't even keep up with an activity right now without wanting to break down and cry sporadically.

2391,jakeh2003,1613357750,"A bit of background: we've known each other our whole lives so we are very close friends, and she has pretty severe anxiety and goes to therapy every week. 

We live far apart so we usually text, sometimes FaceTime, and since covid started we've texted probably around 300-500 messages a day. So a lot, to say the least. But last Saturday she barely texted me at all, then we talked a decent amount on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday but ever since Wednesday she's been taking hours to respond to texts and leaving me on read frequently. So yesterday I asked her if she was doing okay and if she just didn't feel like talking and she said that she just didn't feel like talking and that she ""is responding late to everyone"". The weird thing about this though is that she is still sending snapchats to me and we're having conversations on there just like normal, and she is still sending me tiktoks in the morning as she usually does. So basically everything outside of actual texting has been perfectly normal which makes this more confusing to me. I am kinda worried about her because she also cancelled her therapy appointment this week (which she has done in the past, so not super unusual) and also because even though she's usually somewhat bad at responding, she's never been like this. Should I say anything to check in and make sure she's doing okay, or let it play out? I was going to send her a message tonight checking in but then she did text me something, and left me on read a couple messages later. Should I send her anything at all throughout the day?

2394,SnowBun9968,1613356628,"I(19F) have my first therapy appointment on wednesday, and I plan to send her a document detailing what I have been going through. She is not an OCD therapist, but she is currently my only option. But I am really scared she will react horribly, and think I am a pedophile  when I am NOT. I have not been diagnosed with OCD, and I hate to self diagnose, but alot of my symptoms align. Though, some of my symptoms are very different from those with POCD. Here is what I am going to put in the document:

1. I used to really struggle with intrusive images detailing children being abused by men. These thoughts have diminished, and now they are thoughts like ""I wonder if she is being abused by her father"", and ""what if he is a pedophile"". Though, I have been resilient, and these thoughts are also starting to diminish slowly (they are still very distressing and disturbing nontheless). I am haunted by the idea of child abuse though. Who could ever do this to a child? Why? It makes me cry. I remember watching this series ""Patrick Melrose"" last year. It is so haunting and devastating. I bawled my eyes out, and I will never be able to watch it again. It was so traumatizing, and I feel like I have PTSD. I felt such Immense sadness and fear for the child in the show. I just wanted to hold him tight, and give him the love and care he deserves. I wanted to protect him from that...thing. It doesn't deserve to be called a person. And to learn that it was based on a true person just broke me. Knowing the general idea of what child abuse is cannot be compared to seeing it happen to a real child. 



2. I experience alot of fear and anxiety, especially when I notice that there are children around. Number one, I fear that the children are being abused and just the fact that pedophiles and child abuse exists. Though, I have never feared that I would hurt them, ever. I also fear that the children would cause more intrusive thoughts. This fear and anxiety has built up over time (it might be diminishing though, but I dont know). Though, I dont feel anywhere near a panic attack or anything. My anxiety is constant, and neverending. And this brings me to my next point, rumination



3. I tend to ruminate on things CONSTANTLY. I will  be in a constant state of anxiety throught the day, and I will just switch my worries from one to the next. One minute, I worry about my past porn consumption. The next minute I worry about my intrusive thoughts. Then I worry about my school work... I tend to escape into books, manga, and tv. But It is hard to stop the rumination sometimes (I have gotten so much better though). Being inside all day probably doesn't help, but there is almost nothing else for me to do, and I go on at least 3-5 walks a day (In freezing snowy weather i might add!). 



4. Lastly, I have been worrying about the groinal response most recently. This makes me seem like a monster! I have NEVER gotten any groinal response or arousal to children OR my intrusive thoughts. But I find that I get aroused (or just a groinal response) whenever I get really anxious. Whether this is because I used to masturbate to work off my anxiety or stress, or because I tend to focus on my groin for arousal when I get anxious, I truly dont know. I do feel like this only started though, when I read about it happening to others on this forum. Hearing so many people talk about it probably made me start to worry about myself ever having (or have had) a groinal response. And now look at me. I can only be glad that it happens when I am just anxious, and not when I am specifically thinking about my intrusive thoughts. It doesn't make me feel like any less of a perverted monster though. This is defenitely my current theme of rumination. Ruminating on it just kind of makes it worse though...



5. As you can probably tell, I really worry about being some disgusting bad person. I feel so much shame and guilt about this part of my present, which will hopefully become part of my past. I have never really worried about being a pedophile, because I 100% know that I am not, and I dont see any indicators that I am.  But I really worry about others seeing me as one. Like, if I told people about this, what would they think? I know that this is just reassurance seeking. But I just wish I could imagine people opening up there arms to hug and embrace me, eve while knowing about this horrifying mental sickness that has consumed me. For now all I can see are disgusted and horrified faces of people who would reject me completely. 



**My biggest worry now is just telling my therapist. I recently read about someone's therapist thinking they were a pedophile, when all they had was POCD. Now I am so scared to write about this and tell her. What if she thinks I'm disgusting? What if she thinks I'm dangerous? I would never harm an innocent person or animal, let alone a child. Nor have I ever felt ANY want to do so. I have always been attracted to men FAR older than me (which is another thing I will talk to her about). Should I be so scared to tell her about all of this? What about the groinal response? Do you think she will think I am a pedophile because of it?**

2405,VinX1997,1613351541,"Hi everyone,

After countless doctors appointments and visits, and I really mean countless, no one has really been able to find anything wrong with me, but I’m still convinced there’s something off with me.

Let me explain, and I apologize in advance for the length of this post - but I need to be thorough.

It all started in the beginning of July 2019. My friends and I were celebrating graduating college and we were in my neighborhood. Most of them not being from the area, I wanted to show them a silly hangout spot in High School, which was by a train yard. To make a long story short, I ended up running and hopping on the ladder of a train cart, saw a light pole was coming, and had to jump off - taking a couple turns and rolls. The train was going pretty fast, I had to run hard to hop onto the train. And yes, I was drunk I did not know that I would feel different ever since.

Initially after the fall, I only felt the effects of being roughed up from a fall, cuts and sore. However, about 3-4 days later, I started getting super intense pain around my neck and my upper back, to the point it was hard to walk The pain never once radiated to my legs or arms. Eventually I scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician around mid July but I was too embarrassed to say I fell off a train, so I said I fell while running.

He only sent me in for an X-Ray Scan of my thoracic spine, which came back negative. Once the results came back negative, I was then scheduled for some Physical Therapy (PT). There was one issue however.

The PT only lasted for a couple weeks, and that’s because I had layover in insurance from college to a full-time job for the month of August 2019. 

During this month, I still had terrible pain and I really thought there was something else wrong with me, but because I lied to my doctor and didn’t have insurance I couldn’t seek any medical attention. This gave me terrible anxiety. My back/neck were constantly flaring up, I wasn’t sleeping, thought I was going to be paralyzed, etc. I had a couple visits close to arriving to the emergency room but felt better once I actually got in the car or close to the entrance.

I eventually paid an out of pocket fee around late August to see a specialist and after feeling up on my back and neck he said he didn’t see anything wrong besides sore muscles. This kept me in tact until September where I once had insurance again.

Having insurance, I completed PT all throughout the month of September but I was still having neck pain. Additionally, I started developing some neurological symptoms that I find frightening, symptoms that haven’t really subsided yet - and that’s depersonalization/derealization. I just feel like I’m not really there mentally, like my body is but my mind isn’t. It’s all so surreal. I started thinking my memory is off, feel dizzy, felt like my throat is closing and having throat muscle spasms, and feeling uneasy like I could have a seizure or some other big problem at any moment, and like my life before the fall was a different life. It just seems like I can’t remember anything from years ago. 

I had an MRI of my complete spine and my brain in October 2019, and that all came back negative besides minimal disc degeneration dissection from C5-C6. 

My PT ended in December, and my back is completely recovered but my neck still feels off. And I still have these damn neurological issues which are far worse than any neck stiffness/pain. 

I started reading into TBI’s, and how I could have sustained a mTBI. I decided to see a neuropsychologist, and go through about 6 hours of testing to see if cognitively anything is wrong. I tested fine and the neuropsychologist did not think I suffered a TBI.

Still thinking something was off with me, I decided to see many doctors and specialists, a ton. Functioning neurologists, neuro-optometrists, ENT’s, the list goes on.

None of them have been able to find something wrong with me besides the neuro-optometrist said my eyes were off, which I completed 20 weeks of eye therapy. They said that I improved drastically, and I did get more advanced in eye exercises, but the depersonalization/derealization did not ease up one bit. However, I continued to attend the eye therapy because I still think there’s something wrong with me and I’ll do anything to get rid of these feelings.

Fast forward to today, and one of my friend thinks I’ve triggered generalized anxiety or some sort of anxiety, but I still have some physical symptoms as well which lead me to believe there’s something I haven’t found yet.

The physical symptoms are: neck pain, and this VERY desensitized area near my Cervical-Thoracic Junction. If someone touches around the area or god forbid a chiropractor adjusted me, I would get super super depersonalized/derealized, and I think some serious damage would occur like my neck would snap or something. Additionally, I have what feels like a constant headache and facial pressure.

Mentally, I have several symptoms.

The most discomforting and most affected of my life symptom is the depersonalization/derealization. I don’t feel like myself, and I feel disconnected from reality. This is a huge difference from the person I was before my fall off a train, one of the most extroverted people around who never had anxiety, another reason why I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I didn’t deal with anxiety before the damn fall. Because I think there’s something wrong with my neck, I get this feeling that there’s a disconnect between my brain and the rest of my body, and of course the neck is responsible for sending signals from the brain to everywhere else

Other mental symptoms I have are: I believe I have memory issues, sometimes get dizzy, my head feels different - like there’s something wrong on the interior, maybe some sort of pressure. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts, and whether anyone has a similar story. I am sick of living this life I’ve lived ever since the train accident. I don’t go out anymore, and I’m constantly thinking if there’s something wrong with me and if I’m really in real life. Happens when driving, when walking, always. These thoughts make me think I’m going to pass out because there’s a problem with my head/neck. I NEVER had these thoughts before the fall.

I recently realized that my way of coping with anxiety is simply constantly consuming content (whether it be music or social media) so that any anxious thoughts don’t develop. Ever since this realization, I can’t focus on anything and I feel constantly anxious - to the point of losing sleep and feeling nauseous.

This might honestly be the worst my anxiety has ever gotten in my life and I seriously do not know how to deal with it. Going out with family and friends helps but it’s only a temporary fix, and when I’m left alone at the end of the day, it all comes back in these suffocating waves until I’m left to simply lay down in the dark and pray I fall asleep. 

So. What are your ways to cope? What are some activities or things or places that make you feel safe and relaxed if not for a tiny moment? I really just need to find something new that will grasp my attention or help me calm the anxious thoughts.

1) worried about going back to school, mainly cause of social anxiety, eating infront of others at lunch, the idea of being in a crowd and in class. The thought of talking to people again is genuinely scaring me. 

2) worried about going to town and something awful happening like a terrorist attack and me getting getting caught up in it and dying 

3) (relating to the last one) sometimes I fear getting out of bed because I feel like something awful if I get up and leave my room

4) worried about dying in sleep, I’ll be lying there and my brain will say “hey you are gonna die during tonight” and I’ll believe it every time 

5) (related to the last one) - panicing so much about my health recently and it’s because of covid which is just shitting on my mental health, I simply scratched my neck the other day and now I think I have a tumour under my neck metastasising. 

6) worried about learning to drive - my family have had multiple car crashes and have almost died in them, especially my dad, I really fear that he will get into a car crash that will kill him but he will never listen to any of us. I was so nervous that I had a full blown panic attack the first driving lesson I had. Which just embarrasses me to the core and I feel like a let down thinking about that

7) worried about my grades at school - I have failed every exam I have done this year, I really fear that I’m gonna get kicked out at this point

And I’m slowly losing motivation to do anything because life in general is draining me and I just want to stay in bed cause leaving bed seems like too much energy

In fact we should get the keys next week! :) I suffer with anxiety and although I haven't shown it much throughout the process and have worked hard on it and stayed calm, I'm starting to overthink things and the self doubt is sinking in.

""What if people think we're crazy? We haven't lived together before and we're now getting a mortgage - is everyone going to think we're mad? Is it too soon?"" 

I don't feel it was rushed as my bf was interested in buying before we even got together. Ive rented several times in the past, and rented a flat with a housemate for 2 years of my and bfs relationship, where he stayed with me often. 

We felt renting would slow the process down and the next step would be buying when we felt the time was right. The pandemic accelerated things as we could save up quicker due to spending less. Several of our friends have done and are doing this and it seems like a pretty normal next step for couples. 

Our parents/family/friends seem excited and didn't share any concerns about it being too soon for us or a bad idea. I just worry about what people think if we have never lived together before and if they think we are impulsive. Even though I am the least impulsive person and often overthink things so much I end up talking myself out of them. Moving in together goes feel like the natural and right thing for us though, and I think it'll be great to settle into a nice routine and do the place up ourselves. 

My bf and I talk about everything and he is aware of my anxiety. He says it's normal to feel a bit nervous about this but to try to focus on the positives and the excitement. I've been a bit unhappy living at home due to a lack of space and too many people/chaos and I feel in the way, though I've been grateful to have had the option to stay there.

2424,Ready_Woodpecker7741,1613345251,"Heyo! Throwaway acc here because I just need to speak about this once and for all. (if you want to skip my background story just skip to the last paragraph).

I am 19F, and I have been suffering from anxiety (some ADHD traits) , OCD and probably aspergers all my life. I have had a great childhood, amazing parents and a fantastic sister but it took a toll when i was like 10 and they fought, my dad became an alcoholic and my mom got anger issues. We also got other family issues but those are the focal points. I remember my first panic attack was when i was 6, at a vacation home. I had intrusive thoughts and I panicked, at the time it was news for me. I grew up with OCD and anxiety but never went to therapy because my parents thought I was just a bit anxious and never really cared much about that. (I went to therapy like two times and they diagnosed me with what i said at the top, but not aspergers, however im pretty sure i have it). Fast forward and I went to high school. I was still an anxious teenager and school was bad, many people hurt me and i became more and more socially awkward, but very gladly i also got one of my best friends in there! Things kept going horrible, and my anxiety was so bad. When I went out of this town to college, things got incredibly better; my anxiety dropped, my confidence and social skills went up the roof!! I also never let ocd bother me anymore, and my life got better; the intrusive thoughts calmed down, etc. I can say that I got a lot stronger and happier, I have had amazing panic free times. I now know that anxiety is a monster I can have full control over, and it is not stronger than me. I know it is a distortion of reality and a nonsensical mindset. I know that derealization is the product of a tired mind. Also my anxiety definitely worsens when i am around my mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

But one thing that still lingers to this day is relationship anxiety. It is **so, so bad.** It always goes like this: I start talking to someone, I start to catch feelings, and everything is cute and awesome. Until the realization comes again. I start getting panic symptoms, I doubt everything, I fear I will never have a normal relationship, I doubt my feelings and the other persons feelings... It is a nightmare. When Im with the person I feel cold and emotionless, but when I am far away I just want to be with them. When I talk to them in texts i get so excited but when im too much time alone i start panicking and feel cold flashes in my head. Basically I am afraid of feeling afraid of the relationship. And boy, it really controls me. Maybe because my ultimate goal is a good relationship and anxiety/OCD butchers it for that precise reason? I currently am interested in a guy, and I am so excited to meet him post covid madness but this lingering panic is in the background telling me I am going to fail and im going to lose feelings for him. It makes me want to cry, so bad. I feel so sensitive in these times. My anxiety comes in waves, and the only good thing is when I have the brief clarity moments where I feel this ""Everything is going to be alright"" and I feel this need to cry and hug him... Its like my true self is screaming, ""you're going to have so much fun, hes so lovely and you wanna smoosh him"" and then its followed by the cold, anxious me that only thinks of the worst. How can i get rid of this everytime a relationship comes in? It really is annoying since its the strongest symptom of anxiety i have ever had and that still is strong to this day. Why does this panic keep coming? Its been here in every romantic interaction ive ever had. And why does my anxiety immediately associate romance to sadness and panic? 

TL;DR: Severe anxiety and panic only comes when I am interested in someone

Endless emptiness, problems in relationship, recklessness, fear of abandonment, sadness. I don't even know where to start to get it all out. To give you some background, I am a 20 year old college student living in a foreign country away from my family. In the current state of pandemic, basically spending my days all alone either studying or abusing weed in the night, the only person I regularly visit is my girlfriend who also goes to her uni here.

I am slowly losing all my hopes in myself, and seriously considering visiting a psychologist. I get terrible mood swings ranging from a sort of happiness (rather an absence of all negative feelings) to unsustainable anger and depression like sadness (never been diagnosed, though). The thing I hate myself most for, is probably me reflecting all these negative emotions on my girlfriend. I love her, but in times when she needs me most to support her and be there for her, I cannot even cope with my anxiety.

I feel like all my life, which I have been building, is literally crumbling under my feet and I am the one destroying it, yet I am not able to do anything about it. Everyone seems so distant now, I do not even know how could anyone from my closest ones help me.

Many would consider me a decent looking, accomplished young man. But I would trade everything I have to have the inner feeling of accomplishment and happiness of myself, appreciation for what I have, what I have done. I don't believe in myself as I used to, and feeling like a piece of trash is nothing out of ordinary for me.

So Reddit is probably my last but one resort.

I’m not sure anyone will even see this. I’m frustrated and on edge today. I have pretty severe health anxiety and my biggest trigger is breathing issues. Rewind to December when I got Covid and triggered hard. Could barely function I was so depressed and anxious. 2 weeks later I was finally feeling a bit better. When symptoms leave, so did my daily anxiety symptoms. 

Present: Got a new upper respiratory virus 5 days ago and went into full panic mode because I had a lot of trouble breathing. Luckily it’s starting to clear up, but not before I went into full panic and anxiety. My throat is extremely tight 90% of the day. My chest feels tight as well, but only when heart rate goes up.

I’ve had doctors rule out covid (twice) and have a PCR out waiting for results. I’m honestly wondering if this virus is affecting me more because I’ve had covid recently. Regardless, between my life, work, and small business responsibilities I am drained.

For context, I'm a junior in college majoring double majoring in Physics and Math.  I'm also involved with a couple clubs and organizations that I devote my time to so I really have a lot going on contributing to my stress.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about a year and half ago and I've since gotten my depression under control for the most part.  My depression was so bad that I think it masked my anxiety for a long time, but now that I'm controlling my depression very well my anxiety has steadily gotten worse and worse.  I'll admit that I probably should have talked to a psychiatrist sooner, but the anxiety felt like it was still at a manageable level and I was putting it off until I wasn't so busy.  But the stress from school, the pandemic, thinking about my future, and a few person matters has been getting worse and worse and the last week was filled with a mental breakdowns (no thoughts of suicide) and wondering how I will make it through everything.  Then over the weekend, I guess it became too much and I started having panic attack after panic attack.  Even though I was previously diagnosed with anxiety, it has never been this bad and I don't know how to handle it.  The stress and anxiety is constantly in the back of my head and it's been a struggle to do anything.  I eat very small amounts of food at once so that I don't get too nauseous and I've basically been spending the last two days doing whatever I can to prevent another panic attack.  I can't focus on anything work or school related and I've also lost the motivation to even try to because I know that as soon as I think about the things causing me so much stress I'll have another panic attack.

Now I know that I need to see someone ASAP, but I was hoping someone could enlighten me about my options and maybe some ways to handle the stress and anxiety in the meantime.  I'm at school on an academic scholarship and I'm afraid that if I need to take time off or even go into a psychiatric hospital that I'll lose my scholarships that I worked so hard for.  At the same time though, if my grades continue to slip, I'll lose it anyway.  Even thinking about what I should do to help myself is triggering a panic attack and I'm not sure what to do.  I have so many great things going for me right now and I'm afraid of losing it all if I can't get a grip on the anxiety.  If anyone has been in a similar situation please let me know how you handled it and what you think I should do.

2445,Jade_Alex2606,1613339533,"Hi all, first post here but I'm struggling tonight 😩 not even sure what I want to ask or if I want advice so I guess it is more of a vent.

So basically, I've suffered with anxiety for my whole life as long as I can remember. But due to it being belittled and brushed off from childhood by my father and my ex partner (I lived with my father til age 16 then my ex from 16-27), I honestly never really recognised my feelings as anxiety until around 5 years ago (I'm 32 now). My whole life, all I've been told is ""just don't worry, you're fine, don't be silly, don't be daft, you're being ridiculous"". About EVERYTHING. And my father always made me feel like everything I do has to be PERFECT and asking for help is a weakness. For example, as a kid, I couldn't ask him to help with spelling, he'd tell me that I know where the dictionary is. So I've always been scared to ask for help, or felt like I shouldn't ask for help because I should be able to do everything myself.

On top of all this, I also had a miscarriage last month which really shook me, plus a scan found other health issues in that area which will require surgery. My mind is going crazy every single day after this past month, as well as general Covid life affecting everything for the past year.

I've been off sick from work for 3 weeks and am due to go back tomorrow and I'm shitting myself. I'm somehow very good at masking my anxiety when I need to and I feel like my work think very highly of me, not trying to toot my horn, but I know my manager likes me and thinks I'm a good worker (I'm an admin in a university clinical trials unit).

But I know that in the past couple of months, my performance has slipped a bit and I'm so scared I may have forgotten to do things or left a job too long by putting it off, and scared I'll get some sort of disciplinary tomorrow or something. I'm not sure anxiety is a reason to explain poor performance and slipping up.. it seems like a daft excuse and not good enough.",Anxiety,Stamped down anxiety since childhood starting to affect work performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ljyauv/stamped_down_anxiety_since_childhood_starting_to/,1613310733.0

I'm Alex, in my late thirties. Beside some worries about school performance, about other's perception of me, about this and that, i was always ok to good, and balanced, psychologically speaking.  


Nonetheless, some anxiety about the future started to pile up, as my parents grew older, my mom retired, many of my younger cousins started to have families while i was single. But the tippoint point was two years ago, when i took my first real job in the corporate world, and in a new industry, in a new city where i didn't want to live. I had a panic attack in the plane when i went for my interview. One month before my expatriation, i started to have extrasystoles, did exams, doc didn't see anything, and it went away after a few days. And during those two years, i had several physical manifestations of anxiety, and/or anxiety being created by physical problems: sore throat for 6 months, some kind of reflux, heartburn, etc. And every 6 months, a panick attack. Always the same routine, i go to E.R., do blood checks &amp; all, nothing to report.  


Now i came back to my home country, but still away from my family. Intense job. Lockdown, a bit alone. And in a downward spiral, my mind is focusing on some kind of heartburn/GERD that is becoming permanent, and every symptoms increase the anxiety, the fear boost the symptoms and prevent me to go see a doctor as i'm afraid of invasive exams.  


Every night, even if i elevate my head, i feel a discomfort, a weight in my chest/belly, even if i do stretching, yoga, eat well... and the mind is focusing on it, and have difficulties letting go, to sleep, afraid that this problem is something bad, that i won't wake up.  


In other words, this situation starts to be super annoying and a hindrance, preventing me to take the plane now, or the boat, or any situation that would make me self-aware of being stranded from civilization, from a doctor, etc.

It took me over a decade before I stepped foot into my doctor's office to ask for help. I grew up in a religion where medication and therapy were thought to be taboo and that you should be able to manage your mental health through prayer and god. I know... I left this religion 3 years ago and just last week finally sought help from my doctor for anxiety and depression after trying to do it on my own with exercise and different diets. 

I shared everything with my doctor about how it was affecting my life and my energy levels were at an all time low.  I cried, she listened, it was great.

I went in there with no particular medication in mind but I knew I needed something. My anxiety is most challenging for me when it hits me hard at work. It's nearly crippling. She prescribed me Strattera to start. I've been on it a week now and I'm not loving it. It has made me incredibly drowsy and I feel like I'm in a fog most of the day or a daze. It has definitely eliminated anxiety for me but I don't love the side effects. I also read up on it when I came home and I'm not loving the severe warnings attached to it regarding fatal liver damage. 

I've looked at other meds and their warnings are increased suicidal thoughts or weight gain. if weight gain is attached to any of these medicines for me I know I won't stay on them. There are so many anxiety and depression medications and I'm starting to feel severely overwhelmed because I know that I need something I just have no idea where to start.

I'm also on stimulants for ADHD, so it wouldn't be surprising. 

So, my logic: Cymbalta helps with serotonin and norepinephrine. I had too much serotonin (theoretically). So I want a med that doesn't affect serotonin but still affects norepinephrine.

Now I'm trying Wellbutrin (Bupropion). It affects norepinephrine and dopamine. By my logic, this should be the ideal solution.

I know this is all highly theoretical and the world of medication is rarely this simple, but is my logic at least somewhat sound here? Or am I missing an important point?

Usually the feelings go away by the end of the day, unless they're actually a cold or some kind of sickness, in which case they run their course.

Because I don't have a car at the moment and can't get food delivered, I'm usually going to my grocery store every other day to buy things. Sometimes I get take out (I never sit in) and stop by my deli to get coffee or tea.

Obviously the take out and deli aren't necessities, so I pop in and out quickly and if I don't feel well, I skip them. I always wash my hands, never take off my mask when I'm out, the few times I've met with friends it's a socially distanced walk at a nearby park (early in the morning or late at night, so no one else is around).

I have this worry in the back of my head that I am or have been an asymptomatic carrier, or I had a mild version of covid that I passed off as a cold. With my medical issues though, I doubt if I got it I wouldn't know it. 

Still, every time I feel less than perfect I'm anxious and guilty. I know it could be worse when I compare myself to neighbors on the block that throw gatherings or parties, hear about family bragging on going on vacation, etc. but still.

2473,Warm_Treat_8813,1613332205,"Hi, 

I’m looking for any kind of advice really. I have suffered with anxiety for years on and off but never with Panic attacks.

I had a period of severe anxiety around 12 years ago after the birth of my eldest son, I was eventually after a few months prescribed a high dose of Amitryptline which really helped me. I was on this for many years before it was changed to Fluoextine as the Amitriptyline had given me Tachycardia also due to PTSD.

I eventually got married and for the past 5 years had very little anxiety and managed to lead a normal life with no medication. Last year I started to suffer panic attacks when I was driving. This led to some avoidance behaviour and eventually was happening every time I drove so I have stopped driving altogether. 

Just before Christmas my anxiety and heart rate were at an all time high so the GP put me back on 20mg Fluoxetine and bisoprosol as well as Diazapam. A week in on Christmas Eve I had the worst panic attack I have ever experienced. I actually ended up passing out and having the paramedics out. When I was in hospital they said I had reacted to the Diazapam and told me not to take it. I spent the next three days in bed having panic attack after attack and the most horrific thoughts I have ever had in my life. I stopped all medication as I was not sure what had caused it I was not convinced it was the Diazapam alone and more a combination of all. 

I actually started to feel better but I then caught covid from likely being in A and E as I had been nowhere else. I was ill for around 4 weeks and during this time the drs prescribed me Flupentixol which again made the horrible thoughts return and a sense of no control so I stopped then came the Setraline, and the same thing. I was the prescribed propoponal which I’m yet to take as I’m too scared. 

My dr now has prescribed me Pregablin but everybody says it’s awful and not to take it. I’ve never had a fear of medications or their side effects but I’m
now finding myself in a position where each drug I take is having a real adverse affect on me and I’m now absolutely petrified.

Point is my anxiety and panic attacks are horrific I worry from the minute I wake up to the minute I sleep. I’m having around 8-10 attacks daily on a good day! I now have all the typical symptoms alongside such as dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus and fast heart. Most nights I go to sleep convinced I’m likely not to wake up because of how physically bad I feel.

My husband is still not back at work since Xmas eve as I am terrified to be alone. I have never been dependant on him or anyone like this and I know I need help to get better, I am having cbt currently, but I’m so scared of medication that I’m finding myself in this catch 22 position I literally feel like I’m going crazy and I have never felt so hopeless. 

I guess I’m just looking for any advice re the medication or self help techniques. I am doing meditation, deep breathing cbt and so far I’m just worse. 

Any help particularly with my fear of the meds would be great. I know my GP is the best person but I think they’re running out of things to try and I’m
Not helping by refusing to try them due to sheer fear of how they could adversely affect me after what happened Xmas eve.",Anxiety,Help with severe panic attacks and anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ljvt5f/help_with_severe_panic_attacks_and_anxiety/,1613303405.0

I’ve never been depressed but this is making me feel lonely and a little sad. I’m super anxious now because I’m terrified of getting depression for some reason.

2514,bahobay,1613321156,"Very long title, but I tried to sum up what's bothering me lately in as few words as possible. To explain my situation: I was working a 1-year contract at a research facility in 2020 and got a 1 year prolongation until January 2022, with the option get a permanent contract after that, although I was already told scientists rarely get those.

The job is okay, payment is good, but it feels like more or less doing research for the file cabinet, as the results are pretty much meaningless and just useful to apply for the next round of funding. It's a system that keeps itself alive, without having  impact on anything. It doesn't really hurt, but also doesn't really help anybody. 

In December I was told by a friend to apply at the company he is currently working at because they are hiring. I sent out my application without giving it much thought and two video-interviews later I get the offer to join the company.  It is basically what I was looking for since I left university: A position in the industry to work on something that is acutally needed. Half a year trial period and a permanent contract afterwards.

It just doesn't feel real to me. I was struggling so much in 2019 to find a position somewhere and sent out hundreds of applications. I cannot grasp the fact that one application was sufficient now. I accepted the offer, but it still feels like some elaborate prank. I am imagining that I am going to show up there on my first day and people will just laugh at me for thinking they would be serious. I am also not sure why they actually hired me, as I have no prior experience in the field I am going to work in.

I'm  anxious to give up my current position (that I just began to accept and that I think I am good at) and start new in a different city again. Additionally, I have to find a new flat and have to move across the country within March, which puts more pressure on me, as I still have to work at my current job until the end of March and have to organize everything else during my brakes or after work.  

I am fucking exhausted already, although the new job hasn't even started yet. I'm not even sure why I wrote all of this. I am aware that I just have to get through this now and that things will eventually get better again, but at the moment I just feel overwhelmed. Guess I just needed to write it down somewhere. If you are still here, reading this, Thank you :)",Anxiety,"I should be happy about landing a new job, but I just get more anxious every day.

2515,MoralAmbiguity_,1613320230,"I really just need to vent here. 

I am a man, early 20s, my girlfriend is also early 20s. We have been together for going on 5 years now. Last night we were taking about just like the nature of sexuality via text and I asked her if she had ever questioned her sexuality. So she didn’t respond for quite some time and immediately my anxiety went through the roof. I always get anxious when we hit a wall or it feels like she can’t talk to me about something. But so it was clear after I mentioned that that something was up when she finally did respond so I asked her if she was available to call her. 

So I am just literally shaking at this point as I had already been on a high anxiety day, coming off a high anxiety week. And so I just start asking some basic questions to help her get comfortable wnd told her point blank “I don’t want to make you share anything you’re not ready to, but the nature of our relationship makes me feel like I deserve some sort of answer about what’s going on”. Then finally she says to me “I want to preface this by saying my feelings towards you are still the same” and my heart fucking sank. “But I think I’m bi”. So immediately I just told her that I’m realy proud of her for being able to tell me as communication and emotional transparency are definitely stronger from my end than from her usually. And I just started telling her that this will definitely change how I look at her a bit, but it doesn’t change my love for her at all, it’s just sort of given me a better understanding of her as a person I hope can really benefit us in the future. 

So we talked for a good few hours about our relationship and how it’s been and things and how she got to this point. If I’m being entirely honest, this is something that I expected on some level, just with comments she would make or the way she would respond to certain things, but when she said it, it’s sort of like some pieces fell in to place. Addition I explained to her that I’ve had thoughts about this too with my own sexuality and realized I’m probably more opened to men sexually then she would think, but I’d never see myself in a relationship with one. But it’s absolutely something that will cross my mind. 

So I really just tried to show support to her because I know it’s something she’s never said out loud before and I just let her talk about it. But there is this insecure and likely vein part of me that is afraid she is realising she’s just it that attracted to men. Obviously she told me point blank she still is sexually attracted to me but my anxiety just won’t let go of the idea that she is just staying with me so she doesn’t hurt me. It’s been a long held complaint of mine that she never asks me to kiss her and she never initiates anything in bed and this fear has just really grown now. I know that often it’s a sort of regressive and rude comment men will make on bi women that they’re actually just becoming lesbian or something but I really don’t mean for it to come off that way. She always tells me that just trying to initiate interaction makes her nervous. She really does seem to enjoy things when I make moves though so I do think these are just fears my anxiety is perpetuated, but I just can’t shake them. 

I am really the only long term relationship she has had so I asked her like you know if we got married and I am the last person you’re ever in a relationship with, do you think you’d have regrets with not letting yourself explore with other people? And she told me she doesn’t feel like it would bother her at all and that was a major relief for me. I am preparing to start graduate school this fall in another city so it’s something that’s been on my mind about if perhaps it would be best to let her make the decision about how she wants to proceed with our relationship. I am all for trying it even semi-long distance and we do seem like we are in a strong place currently. It just felt like an opportunity to speak candidly about some feelings we may have been pushing down. We had a really nice sort of bonding conversation talking about what women she’s had crushes on and sort of revealing the celebrities we both find attractive. Which maybe this comes off as odd to some but I think it was a really nice relief for both of us to have the moved this wall and open you talk about something that she felt maybe she had been hiding from me. 

I am seeing her tonight and I’m hoping it will be a big relief and things will feel normal but I’m just been eaten with stomach pain and lack of focus all morning because I feel so anxious. 

I really don’t mean to offend anyone who is part of the LGBT+ community with anything I’ve said, and I really don’t feel my personal beliefs in general are represented by these feelings of doubt, I just needed an anonymous way to get this off my chest as I really can’t share this information with anyone, being such a private part of my girlfriend and I wouldn’t feel right just talking to any of the usual people about it.",Anxiety,My girlfriend came out to me last night,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ljrlhd/my_girlfriend_came_out_to_me_last_night/,1613291430.0

2520,Sugmao,1613318315,"Hello,

I'm new to posting so please mind any mistakes that may be made. At this point in my life, I feel like I need advise from others who may have went through the same ordeals or have experienced an EXTREME anxiety disorder.

A little backstory: I am currently 25 and work at a finance firm about 20 minutes away. I have lived by myself for about a year now(no pets) and do enjoy the alone time of when I get a panic attack and can suppress out everyone. This can get a little contradicting, though. Around Freshman year of college I developed an anxiety disorder that made it hard for me to socialize at times but managed to fight around it and get through many presentations, social interactions, trips, etc.. Fast Forward to today and I am stuck on what I NEED to do today in order to become healthy for myself. A few years ago I started to get paranoid while driving or riding in a car. My head would feel rushed and I tried to concentrate on my breathing but it seemed to only make it worse.  I developed a side effect of getting tingly fingers which then escalated to my whole hand which then caused my hand to clamp in hard and I couldn't feel anything in it. This got so bad one time that after a work out, me and my friend were driving back to my place and less than 30 seconds away from my house I made him stop the car and I stumbled out of the car.. I couldn't walk for some reason and then my whole left side of my body went numb. It felt like a stroke. about a few minutes later after freaking out and telling him to call the ambulance, I threw up and felt better. Ambulance came and asked me if I was ok and I told them ""yes, it was just a bad panic attack."" Fast forward 3 years and that has never happened to me again like that. I've had bad situations but never to that extent. However, it gave me PTSD from the incident. It made me always think of the ""what-ifs"". Thats the problem I am having to face today. My anxiety is at an all time high from constant fear of ""what-ifs"". 

Recently, at work, I have to give one-on-one presentations to clients on loans that they are approved for. About two weeks ago, I was doing a presentation and I felt like I was going to pass out for some reason. I told the client, ""Im sorry give me a second"" and took a drink of water and proceeded. during the rest of the signing process I constantly got crazy head rushes and thinking I was going to pass out. Now every time I try to meet with a client or someone I always think about the ""what-if"" and get to the point of feeling like i'm going to pass out. I now have developed a tremendous fear of passing out.  I have never once passed out in my life but I do have a twin sister who passed out a lot when we were younger at doctor offices and dentists. But all I can think about constantly at work now is passing out at any point or needing someone to get me help. I told my manager about this and she was very understanding on the situation and told me if I felt like I was going to then she can step in and finish the signings for me. That did make me feel better but also made me feel like I'm relying on someone too much. 

Now looking at the current situation with all other factors, the pandemic has made me really never go out and now when a friend asks me to go out or go somewhere I usually say no because I'm terrified of fainting or having a bad attack and needing someone to help me. Driving has also become a huge issue. When I'm stopped in the middle of congested traffic or a stop light I get so anxious and always think that if I do have to stop right here then what will others think or do? Stopping in the middle of traffic or a stop light? people would hate you and wouldn't give two shits whats going on. So I tend to always think of an exit strategy now when I drive just in case I have to pull over and freak out for a sec. I always tend to text me mom or call her when I'm stuck too, to help cope and calm me down. My mother has always been there for me through this. She constantly tells me to breathe and i'll be ok. She also gives me a hard time for not always taking my medication but I've told her(honestly) I've tried for months and nothing has helped. I've been off-and-on a number of medications for it and also have a small dose prescription of xanax but don't tend to take often. Even those don't seem to help either. Just today I went to the grocery store 5 minutes from me and had a panic attack on the way their and in the store.. Everything is freaking me out.  **I am at the point right now of being too anxious to drive to/from work, actually performing my job/daily activities, and constantly overthinking about my anxiety and breathing.**    

I am sorry for the long read but at this point I don't know if I should take a leave of absence to better myself and/or find a new job that I can work remote in the process or to just preserver though it like I have been trying to do. I am worried about bills stacking up though if I quit but do have some money saved. Being 25 makes me feel like I'm missing all these opportunities with life as well, since I'm constantly too anxious to do anything. I really don't know what to do at this point.",Anxiety,What should I do? Extreme Panic Disorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ljqy1l/what_should_i_do_extreme_panic_disorder/,1613289515.0

For the brain
- YouTube playlist of beats to reduce activity in the amygdala 
- YouTube playlist of beats to increase parasympathetic activity

For the heart
- Go on a walk up to the mountains every morning for an hour, I try to empty my mind and enjoy my surroundings
- Do 10 minutes of HIIT as soon as I wake up, dunno if that’s beneficial tbh

For blood pressure
- do 10 minutes of meditation every day 3 times, spaced between morning, midday and late evening
- do 10 minutes of tai chi or yoga, 3 times, before or after meditation 
- cut bread out, have a strict diet of fruit, salad, yogurt, nuts, legumes and fish

I also practice the “IDGAF” technique although now it is proving difficult

Things I have to fix
- abandon the phone
- start doing crosswords and sudoku
- be more sociable and friendly (I actually say hello to everyone I see when I walk outside and try to keep eye contact without bumping into a tree)


Things I would like to add
- deep massage (I hear it is miraculous)

2524,TroLLageK,1613317236,"Holy smokes. So I'm usually someone who is very particular about things, I need to make sure I have enough time in the day to do the things I need to do. The latest dilemma is the fact that this week from Tues-Fri I start work at 7am, rather than the 9am I usually do, which I usually wake up at 6am every day. 

This means I need to leave around 6:30-6:40am to get there on time/early so that I have enough time to part and get settled. So then I have to calculate, how much time do I need in the morning? I need to eat, get coffee, use the washroom, brush my teeth and everything, get changed, and if it snows I need enough time to clean the snow on my car.

So what time do I want to wake up? 5:30 I have an hour to do everything which seems like a lot but I know I might just freak out, or 5 so I have the extra 30 minutes as a safety net? But then I need to be asleep by 9pm the previous day so I have to factor in, when will I shower? When will I meal prep? How will I make sure I am actually asleep by 9pm because I usually have a very hard time falling asleep?

Do I meal prep today so tomorrow it's less things I need to do? Do I just not do it all and eat out on Tuesday and then Tuesday evening I meal prep for the rest of the week when I get home? But then what if I don't have enough time at lunch to drive to get food and drive back and eat and use the washroom before my lunch is done?

2540,ThrowRA_Squirrel,1613309218,"I’ve [26F] suffered from anxiety since I was a child. But over the years it went from something annoying but manageable to it controlling all parts of my life.

I noticed it began to take over when I started college which is also when I began dating my ex. Over time it got worse and worse, to the point I passed out from it and wouldn’t know what to do with my built up energy resulting in me hitting/punching myself.

I’ve had a lot of past trauma, so it’s unclear for me what triggers it most of the time.

Once my ex and I split, it became better and manageable. But I’m not sure if that was also my coping with the loss of the relationship as it was very messy.

I stopped dating for a bit and the anxiety went away. I loved myself. There were still days it would control me though and I would pass out do to stress and anxiousness.

I started started dating my current boyfriend about a year ago, a week or two before lockdown. Obviously COVID has been really hard for a lot of people, me included, working at a grocery store.

My anxiety has once again reached an uncontrollable level and I’m not sure what to do at this point.

Medical background:
I took Prozac in college for 3 months and felt like I was being stabbed every moment of the day.

Early last year, I tried taking Lexapro for a bit. It seemed like it worked at first but quickly my body would adapt, so they kept having to bump the doses to keep it working.

I’m awful at taking pills at the same time each day so I accidentally would mess up a lot and feel wonky. When moving I stopped taking it all together due to me forgetting then not knowing where the pills even were.

I don’t want to be on medication forever to feel “normal” so I feel like that was a factor for me going off of it as well.

Are there others out there that have felt similarly about medication? Or people that have been able to get off of it and be ok after a bit?

I started off in a very bad mental place and I have made so much improvement. I have so many more good days or atleast good moments in between the bad days and spirals. However whenever I have a good day I panic. 

• I am scared my therapist will tell me I don't need to go to her anymore because I am doing better. I am extremely attached to her and miss her so much in between sessions. It is very painful. 

• I am scared when I go to my psychiatrist they will think I am wasting their time because I am doing so much better already so why do I need to go to them. I really do want the evaluation so I know for sure why I think and act the way I do sometimes. 

• I am also scared that my T will get in trouble if I am too well to have been reffered to the psychiatrist. 

This panic and overthinking makes me not enjoy my good days and moments and sometimes pulls me back into that dark place.

2543,songster16,1613307941,"Sometimes I watch the squirrels in my yard, eating an acorn, ever vigilant about their surroundings.  It keeps them alive of course, that anxious awareness of what's *possibly* out there.

My mental *default* is the same.  Any time my mind isn't occupied on something, any time there's a quietness, anxiety swooshes in, the way cold air swooshes into my room when I open my bedroom door in the morning.  *""What's wrong; something's wrong.""*   It's an electric buzz, like when a 'normal' person suddenly remembers there's a big test tomorrow that he/she/they forgot to study for.

What CBT therapists don't understand, because they've never had anxiety like this, is that the negative thoughts come *after* the *feeling.*   We're not anxious because we think stupid, irrational, negative thoughts, we think those things *because* we *feel* 'something's wrong' and we're trying to fill in the abyss that comes along with the feeling.

It's a state of being, that *feeling.*  Free-floating anxiety.  The way air freely floats.

Some things have cures (like an appendectomy), and some things just *are*.

Medication helps...to a degree....depending on the person....

Mindfulness helps....to a degree.  Who wakes up in the morning and *immediately* is mindful of something external to their inner default?  Not me.  Though I have every trick in the book to get out of inner absorption, the anxiety that sucks one inward.

A lot of things help...to a degree.

At the end of the day, like so many unpleasant things that people just have to live with and cope with, one does the best one can.

2544,CalTheSpy,1613307264,"Hello all! So I'm having my wisdom teeth removed on March 2nd. I'll be going to the hospital to get them out and I'll be getting General Anaesthetic, so I'll be asleep the whole time. But funnily enough, it's not the sleep or the surgery I'm worried about. It's actually the before and the after that worry me.

I'm worried I'll be so unbelievably anxious before the surgery, I'll end up violently gagging or having a panic attack that'll make my Mum (who will be with me on the day) really ashamed of me and give the doctors a really rough time trying to deal with me, who as a grown adult, should behave better.

I have a terrible gag reflex and a big phobia of vomiting, and the very thought of having the numbing agent injected into my mouth before I get put under and / or the gauze pads being or going to be placed way in the back of my mouth after I wake up make me really scared. 

And I gotta keep them in there and replace them every few minutes or so until the bleeding stops. And I know with my gag reflex, I won't last two seconds before I violently gag and have to get them out. I have told my Mum and the hospital about my anxiety and gag problems, but I'm afraid whatever the hospital will do for me to keep me from gagging and being anxious won't be enough. .

I just want this procedure to be over and done with so I can get these flippin' teeth out of my mouth. Because as anxious as I am right now about this procedure, I know deep down that I have to get this over and done with now or suffer even worse teeth problems later down the line by leaving them for too long.

2551,purplecatuniverse,1613304772,"“Have you ever had an anxiety attack before? Do you understand what that’s like?” No, I don’t but that shouldn’t minimize my anxiety. Very honestly, I wish I had anxiety attacks because at least that’s clear cut. An anxiety attack is a thing that doctors and the general populace recognize --- Instead, I’m a person that says they have anxiety without any experiences that are tangible to friends, psychiatrists, therapists, teachers, and employers.


My last psychiatrist began implying that I was no longer suffering from anxiety. I suppose that’s because I can’t articulate much about the experience. I struggle to be able to tell when I’m anxious. I don’t understand my anxiety and therefore no body can understand my anxiety. I can’t describe how it affects me day to day. I know the consequences of it. I can barely function and I’m not the same person I was like 6 years ago. But why? How? What am I feeling? 


It’s pretty different from depression.


It’s like living in a world where my space/my life is full of fuzzy fibers.  I imagine it looks like a cloud of steel [steel wool](https://survivaltek.com/?p=5926). But these fibers are sharp/uncomfortable when touched. So whenever I move or think or breathe I come into contact with these fibers.


Or maybe it’s like having the worst stomach virus you’ve ever had. Stomach cramps. Vomiting. Diarrhea. You’re balled up on the floor writhing in pain because you’re so uncomfortable.  It’s that extreme pain and discomfort but not physically. It’s mentally. That’s how I feel in my head 24-7.


Tonight I’ve been thinking about how I am so incapable of distinguishing my anxiety from my other states and I’ve come to the conclusion that might be because no other states exist to draw that distinction. I wonder if I’ve truly been anxious constantly for 6 years. All I know is the way I exist now isn’t right or normal or healthy.

Idk if any of you have experience this in any way.
I'm suffering from anxiety for a while, but it's been a year since it became worse. I'm in a long time relationship (10y by now). My partner (30M) and I (29F) have had a good sexual life, although I've never been very active since I had some trauma while I was a child related to sex, so does he. However and although he's been on an of depression for many years, he's super active and requesting sex very often. I like it and he's super inventive, caring and always thinks of new things to do in bed. But since my anxiety is kicking hard I've been less and less active, I seem to have forgotten how to engage him into sex, and how to enjoy the play before. I feel very frustrated because he's disappointed because he thinks I'm no longer interested in him, and that's not the case. Simply I'm not so interested in sex because of my anxiety, and feels difficult to me to be turned on. He, on the other way, the more depressed he is, the more sex he demands, and cannot understand why this doesn't happen to me.
I've been trying to push the negative thinking away, but whenever I think of start playing and trying to turn him on, the negative thinking cames again (I think I'm being childish, I feel embarrassed, I feel that I'm not sexy at all...) And I end messing it out and he usually rejects me, because I'm acting weird and I seem forced to do it.
I've tried to explain this to him, but he doesn't understand it or either thinks I'm not trying hard enough to be better.
(I'm on therapy btw, and he doesn't want to go to couple therapy or anything alike)

After years of struggling with (undiagnosed) anxiety and depression, which made our 9 year old son miss almost all of the first and second grade, we have finally decided to get evaluated by a psychiatrist which immediately prescribed Prozac. We did not realize how bad the situation was and we we're just hoping that he would grow out of it. He is in 3rd grade now, and can barely read or write. The medicine worked almost immediately - he is active, seems happy, playing outside with friends, rollerblading and even not opposing school so much.

I started having issues with acid reflux on Jan 1. Woke me up out of my sleep. Started Pepcid 40mg twice a day. Still sort of feeling it but it’s hard to tell at this point. 

I’ve had anxiety since high school but with the acid issues, it became impossible to control on my own. 
I began buspirone 5mg x2 a day about a month ago. It helped with the anxiety (did give me appetite loss), and I don’t know if it was the buspirone, everything I have going on in my life or a combination of the two but I suddenly got very depressed and could not stop obsessively worrying about anything and everything. I didn’t want to kill myself, but I just didn’t want to be around anymore. 

My GP started me on Setraline 25mg. I have been on it for 6 days. Holy. Shit. 

I am SO sick. Appetite is non existent I’ve lost about 15 pounds in a month, I’m barely sleeping. My chest feels weird/excited-y. Sort of tight. Dry mouth. Nausea like a mf. Some excessive sweating from my feet. I’ve mostly just been in bed because I’m so miserable. 

Tonight I got really cold. Socks on, heat on 71, two blankets and I couldn’t get my feet warm. And they were sweating. I finally warm up, feel really hot and cold for a while and now I feel somewhat normal as far as temperature goes. Feet are still hot/cold and sweaty. 

I went to my doc a few days ago asking if all this was normal and if I should be concerned with seratonin syndrome (after some research). She said no because buspirone doesn’t really effect seratonin and that it’s normal to have all these side effects during the ramp up period. 

Called the pharmacy to ask about taking these two together and they said with my dosages being so low, I don’t need to worry. 

The hypochondriac in me is trying to remain calm. Someone please tell me that these symptoms are normal and that I’m going to feel better soon.

My boyfriend of two years is having a “minor” surgery next Friday and I’m terrified. It’s a fairly safe operation and he’s gonna be 100% okay. Or that’s what doctors say. My anxiety says something COMPLETELY different. I’m so scared and I can’t stop thinking about it.

So I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder about a month ago and I’ve started lexapro, which has been helping a lot. I’ve always dealt with anxiety but over the quarantine I had a traumatic experience and it got a lot worse. After this event, I’ve had these sort of Self-Hatred attacks where something may happen and I can beat myself up so bad I start crying and think that I’m the worst person of all time. I just bully myself so bad and make myself feel so terrible about something. I really don’t know what this is. They are a lot different from panic attacks and I was having them before I was having panic attacks. I was just wondering if anyone has these as well or if someone can help me put a name on them because all I call them is outbursts to my therapist and psychiatrist.

*To the mind that is still,* 

*the whole universe surrenders. – Lao Tzu*

In Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), King Arthur severs the arm of a Black Knight but the Knight is rather unfazed:

“Tis but a scratch!” 

And when Arthur chops off the other one, The Knight still remains calm:

“It’s only a flesh wound!”

So Arthur proceeds to chop his both legs off.

“We’ll call it a draw, then!”

The Knight keeps his composure whatever happens. His mind rules over his reality, albeit a sarcastically grim one…

Our reactions define our mental states. As Buddha taught, change itself is never painful. It is the resistance to change that causes suffering. A river may go on flowing even if it gets muddy. A mind may take its course even if it is agitated. A black knight may guard his trail even when all his limbs are f\*cking chopped off!

So, one is free who tames his mind to “not mind” the troubles of life. Who simply lets things come and go, without getting attached to their reflections. 

Now, everybody can remain all patient and holy in a Zen monastery. The question is, can you keep your composure in the chaos of a modern life. Can you remain calm, working as a fast food server at rush hour?

This is why patience lies at the core of all spiritual teachings. Many wounds can be tended simply with the passing of time. 

Attar of Nishapur recounts the story of a powerful king. The king assembles his circle of wise elders to create a ring that will make him happy whenever he is upset. The sages take a long time and finally bring him a ring as he asked. The king takes a look but he is perplexed by its commonness. He asks “What the bloody hell is so magical about this ring?” The sages tell him to look inside. The king does as told and sees some words engraved on it: 

**It reads, “This too shall pass.”**

The break up you are suffering from? This too shall pass.

That toe that you broke? This too shall pass.

The rush hour working at your fast food counter? Yes, believe it or not, this too shall pass!

Nothing is ever permanent. Whatever is pervasive for now, shall be scattered later. Whatever is absent today, may be found tomorrow. Good things come to those who wait. Bad things leave patient ones behind. As Churchill once said, “If you are going through hell, keep going.” Because chances are, you will arrive at a better place…

***To all that were hurt by love and may feel they may never find it again, Happy Valentine’s Day.***

The next one will always be different from the last. Whether you were hurt by family, friends, or your significant other. The abuse, the trauma, the breakup, the divorce. It will never change who you are. You are never too difficult to love. There will always be someone to hold you, caress you, and whisper the sweetest of words to you. There will be that someone that will make you feel like you are the universe. And it’s true, you are the embodiment of the universe, you are the universe personified. You are never too old nor too young to find the one, and it’s fine if it takes time. Love will find you and fate will make its decision. And it’s okay to feel. Cry, Laugh, love. I’m here for you, and we’re okay. You’re okay. I love you! stay Safe. You’re worthy and loved.

***To all that have a family, a lover, someone. Happy Valentine’s Day.***

I wish you nothing but blessings in your life. I wish you stay with your someone. Life is not always a smooth road, it’s bumpy and curved. But that’s is why we call it life, no? I send you love and light and hope you have the best Valentine’s ever. I love you!

***To all, that ache for someone, love in their life, or perhaps may have never experienced love. Happy Valentine’s Day.***

It’s okay, I understand. It hurts. But we’ll find someone. 

We’ll find that someone that will make us a roller coaster of emotions, we’ll find that someone that’ll stay with us through the darkest and the brightest of times. I’m impatient, but I’m also excited! Who’s this person that’s going to make me feel like I’m on top of the world? Time and fate will only tell! Until then, it’s okay, I’m here, and I love you.

TW: brief mentions of past self harm &amp; past suicidal feelings/ attempts. 

I’ve been talking to many of you about your anxieties and frustrations. I invite people to come vent to me, and I listen/ offer advice. 

I have received quite a few questions, most of which similar to “Why?”

I figured I would create a post to explain myself a little bit. 

For backstory:

I haven’t opened up or vented to anybody in about 3 years. I had a friend who swore to “always be there for me” constantly. Out of the blue, they told me that they despised me and I’m apparently quite a burden. It wasn’t traumatic or anything, but I just don’t find myself wanting/ capable to open up to anybody. 

I also have struggles with extreme panic attacks, in which I become severely suicidal and impulsive. I don’t yet know how to control these, if I’m being honest. 

Now, onto my current experience:

I’ve been having a lot of trouble keeping my head up these past few months. I’m two years clean from self harm, and my last attempt was six months ago. Things have really started getting bad again, and so I’ve been struggling not to do anything permanent. 

A few days ago, I had a big panic attack.

I got a notification from one of my favorite twitch streamers. 

In the middle of a panic attack, I still joined his stream.

I joined, and as soon as he saw me in chat, he got excited.

He knows me by name &amp; nickname. His cousins and brothers do, too. He told me how happy he was, just to know I was there. He was so, so pleased to see me. It’s hard for me to believe somebody could really feel that way.

He asked me about my work, and told me he was... proud of me. 

He waits for my messages to pop up in chat, before moving on. He asks me questions by name. He laughs at my jokes. He asks for my opinion. He treats me with the same kindness and patience that I have. And it makes me feel loved. 

I know that my girlfriend loves me, obviously. But I barely get to text her every two weeks. She’s also very quiet &amp; reserved.

But he made me stop crying. I didn’t have to make myself vulnerable and open up, for him to help me. He has no idea I was even having a bad day. But he showed me warmth that I’m not used to. 

I want to do that for others. I’m diagnosed ND, though possibly autistic. I get nervous and freak tf out around anybody in person. But I can talk to others online with little to no issue. 

I just want you guys to feel heard and so badly— so, so badly, I want you guys to feel loved.

2590,maddhew9,1613285594,"I am seeing a Psych and have been diagnosed with ADHD. The diagnosis came off the back of a tough time last year where I was struggling with working from home and I used Alcohol to self medicate for too many days in a row. I needed some valium in order to counter withdrawals and stop drinking, I was able to do this in a couple of days. I have been on Vyvanse since which has been amazing at keeping me motivated and not looking to drink to counter understimulation and restlessness. I have been able to limit drinking to weekends only and mostly not binge.

Last week I had a (now uncommon) big night out and was awful the next day. The Vyvanse helped with focus, but the anxiety, restlessness and sleeplessness were back. I managed to hold out until a reasonable hour to have a few hair of the dog beers, and drank a bottle of wine before bed. The next day things were far worse and the cravings for Alcohol were back. The last thing I wanted was a drink but I was craving instant relief, and the cravings were enough to sip wine before noon. 

I have managed to get back on the straight and narrow, but did need a few drinks for a couple of days. Obviously the best thing to do would be to stop drinking or avoid binges altogether. I do have poor self control in social situations and despite best intentions, I get carried away. I don't have a constant dependence and can go days without drinking. I feel like if I had some valium on hand, I could easily get over the next day withdrawls and 1 big night wouldn't turn into 3-5 days of drinking.

I understand my Psych may be reluctant to prescribe me Valium as they can lead to addiction. I do not have a history of substance abuse outside that small period of boozing last year. I don't believe I am a risk as the anxiety is gone a day or 2 after not drinking. The initial alcohol consumption isn't to self medicate anxiety, but the subsequent consumption is. I found Valium in 5mg doses to be calming without having an over the top effect, again not something I think I would crave.

I also understand there is a risk that removing some of the consequence of drinking may lead to drinking more. I don't drink mid-week by choice and on weekends unless I am at a party etc.. I don't feel the need to drink anymore than 2-3 drinks (at which point I am fine the next day). I don't think this would lead to more drinking.

Do you think there is any chance my Psych would prescribe these for me to have in the cupboard for a rainy day? Not ideal, but they could break the potentially vicious cycle.

Hey everyone I thought I’d share some issues I am currently having/feeling.

Firstly I just want to say they are probably not as bad or interesting as most posts here and I know I am lucky in many ways.

The main thing I am anxious about is my job. It’s a fairly demanding, high paced professional IT job. I have been finding it hard to cope with and the pressure from clients and management really get to me. We are also severely understaffed and I have spoken to my manager but feel like there is not much they can do. They have tried to be supportive. I feel like I am not good enough at times even though I’ve been told they are happy with me and the pressure has really gotten to me. I get anxiety when Sunday hits or the mornings before I log in, sometimes I start to feel physically sick. I also realised that I don’t have any passion for the job.

The problem is with covid and having a large mortgage (need the stability)and family it’s hard to find a job and honestly I barely have any time I’m that busy in my job. Also I have no passion I feel so changing jobs in the same field might not help. I am in my early thirties and feel like a career change will be too hard.

2593,winnyroe,1613285333,"Hello everyone :)
I just left home and went back to my room at uni for exams a couple of days ago and already my homesickness is taking a toll on me.
I started studying about a year ago but only was at uni about three times for a week or two because all classes were held online... 
The rest of the time I spent back home with my parents, about 600km (6-7 hrs by train) away. Now I'll have to stay atleast six weeks, which I know doesn’t seem like a long time but there’s just nothing for me to do distract myself from my terrible homesickness.
Covid measures are very strict, everything’s closed down, there’s a curfew in place and your only allowed to meet one person. I'm trying to build a routine (which kinda works now that I have a lot of studying to do but all exams but one are over in 10 days and then I still have a month here).
I wake up every morning with this unexplainable panic and in tears because I feel so alone and really miss home and it’s kind of distracting me from my studies too. I'm also really anxious about the trivial things to do, like doing laundry in the public washing machine in the building, going grocery shopping, which only makes matters worse.
I try to go for lots of walks and when I'm out or go to an in person exam, like yesterday I'm okay because I'm busy but back in my room I always feel like a panic attack is coming and my mind constantly worries about the days ahead.
Like, when I go back home in six weeks, I may only be able to stay for a short time because my uni is thinking about at least offering one class in person which is terrible because then I’d have to spent the rest of the time with all the online clssses in my tiny room...
I guess I just really miss home. Being able to go out into nature, spend time with my dog, feel comfortable in my surroundings (my room at uni is very poorly soundproofed: no music or tv on speaker, my neighbors hearing every word I say on the phone...), and I miss my parents too because I have a close relationship with them and it’s just so nice during lockdown to not be alone.
Well, I'm sorry for this reallyyy long text, but I thought maybe some of you have any experiences/tips/ideas to share? I'm really hanging on by thread here...

2597,FamiliarDiscussion8,1613280594,"When I was diagnosed with anxiety, I was having an extreme case— I was having loads of panic attacks along with the regular everyday anxiety that was preventing me from living my life. My doctor had prescribed me Zoloft and clonazepam (.5mg) for the panic attacks. I wasn’t a huge fan of taking the Zoloft(or any medication) — it made me feel “off”— like a zombie— so i stopped doing it. I took the clonazepam for the panic attacks when they occurred,  but I really wasn’t a fan of consistently taking any of it. So I just stopped altogether and  tried to hack the anxiety on my own. 

Flash forward a few years, and it comes out that my brother— who had never struggled with anxiety— was abusing Xanax in college. I don’t believe it was ever prescribed to him, but I honestly to this day don’t know the full details, other than that he was in deep and got into a major accident over it. 

At this point I fully gave up any and all anxiety medications so they wouldn’t be in the house when he came home. 

Recently though (years later), I feel like I’m struggling significantly again,  and I feel I’m in a difficult spot as my anxiety has worsened even further despite my efforts to cope with it naturally. My close friends are worried about me. I’ve been having panic attacks again more frequently and they are becoming more severe.
However, Because things got so bad with my brother, and because I wasn’t a fan of the Zoloft— (or of taking anything really if I can find a way to avoid it) im wary to reach out to someone/to get back on medication. 

I’m afraid that if I’m family knew I was getting on medication they would be triggered/ worried because of the things that happened with my brother. 

I just don’t know what to do because I think I need to take steps towards getting back on medication again, but I don’t want to hurt my family or make them worry (even though it wasn’t me with the problem— I believe they would worry after seeing what happened with my brother because it was a really bad situation) obviously I’m wary because I’m not sure how I feel about getting on meds again— and I know my family would over analyze—but I am trying very hard to cope with the anxiety and I think it is too overwhelming to handle on my own.

Recently I’ve had a lot of motivation to improve myself and this resulted in me making some more money than usual and stepping up my fitness level (I’m a senior in college). I worked hard and I’m proud but I’ve definitely noticed some changes in how I’m treated now. 

For example, my family members and close friends are usually my biggest supporters but as of recently, they’ve all been very bitter towards me (I assume due to the money and fitness). It just bothers me so much because I personally look up to people who make more money and are more fit than me. I’ve noticed a lot of “underhand” comments and overall passive aggressiveness. 

The worst part about all this though in my opinion is that I immediately notice the change. For example, let’s say I have a week where I don’t make as much money as usual. I notice that the bitterness goes away temporarily until I start earning again. I just can’t stand people like this. It’s always the ones who don’t work hard and are lazy.

I've gone to the doctor so many times because of this and they always tell me it's anxiety/stress. 

I'm experiencing like all of them right now and am of course freaking out.

I cant even be comfortable in a room alone because I feel like I'm judging myself. I'm so embarrassed and uncomfortable all the time and any time I try self improvement I get this voice telling me how embarrassing I am and how it's not going to work anyways.

I hate myself, and it's hard to admit that. I have so much internal shame. i cant tell anyone because that feels like its too much. 

maybe nobody even thinks those things about me anymore. I'm just so paranoid about it constantly. I think those things about myself so maybe I'm just projecting.

I'm trying but ultimately I'm suffering and I dont know if I'm being too hard on myself or if I'm not being hard enough and i just cant escape.

One day, me and a second student teacher were chatting with each other about a child in the class. The main teacher had  left the classroom with the children for snack time. I ended up not going to accompany her because I wanted to use this opportunity to work on an assignment related to the classroom. The second teacher was marking children’s work. 

When she came back with the children, I remember the main teacher solemnly stated these 3 aforementioned words to me before continuing to teach the class. I don’t know what came to me or how I got triggered, but I left the classroom to cry in the washroom. I eventually left the washroom and hid in an empty hall curled in a ball for another hour before the other student teacher found me.

I ended up going home for the day not even 2 hours into the school day. Although the main teacher apologized to me, I felt really bad because it unexpectedly ended up being my last day in the classroom due to the sudden lockdown in my city. I didn’t get to formally say goodbye to anyone.

I still think about this moment to this day. Because of this incident, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to become a teacher with my anxiety disorder.

So I’m 20 years old, I live in the U.K. and I’m studying at university. I started university in September and my emotions seem to have got more and more out of control since. I don’t have any friends and I really mean that. I feel lonely and isolated a lot of the time, and like a bit of a failure that I haven’t made one decent friend by the age of 20. I honestly question why I own a phone a lot of the time because I know no one will be trying to contact me. I think it’s just been made worse this year because I’ve been in an environment where I’m surrounded by people my own age, but also because I’ve had a lot of time to think.

I’m also transgender, which is relevant to some of this. I was born a girl but identify as a guy. Going to university was the first opportunity I’ve had to be myself, which has been great, but it’s also made me really self conscious. I look about half the age of most guys my age and I can tell some people don’t know whether to refer to me as a boy or a girl. No one has ever been nasty about it, but I just have zero confidence in myself because I know I stick out. I just get anxious when I have to speak to people, even if I know them well, because my voice is higher than what you’d think for a guy. I definitely am quiet, which obviously wasn’t great when I started uni because I didn’t say much and then I sort of got lost in the background. It’s definitely part of the reason I didn’t make any friends. I just have this internal battle where I know no one has been horrible to me about it, yet I’m still constantly scared people won’t like me because of it.

I’m also struggling to concentrate doing any form of work and I keep handing things in late. I know I picked the right course, but whenever we have a lesson I just can’t seem to focus or take an interest. This really is a case of me needing to get my act together, but I know a lot of it is linked to my current uni situation. I start thinking about my course, but then get stressed at the fact that everyone on my course seems to have made friends, and then I start dreading going back, and the cycle repeats. The course itself is definitely a positive, but it always seems to turn into something negative.

Today everything just felt like it was getting on top of me when I heard they may be easing lockdown restrictions, because I really don’t want to go back to university. I keep having these moments where I just panic or overthink something and just burst into tears. I spent most of my time there alone where I could go days without anyone speaking to me. That’s why I’m much happier being at home because at least I have my family to talk to. The idea of going back to that room and just being alone again fills me with dread. Seeing other people who had made friends hanging out together just made me feel worse. It’s been hard enough to meet people with the covid rules in place, although I obviously understand why they’re necessary, but now most people have made friends, it’s even harder to make some, because there doesn’t seem to be anyone who is the same situation as me. Trying to find people to live with in second year is also an issue because I can’t seem to meet anyone. I feel I’m just constantly on the outside, and I’ll just have the odd conversation with someone, but there’s nobody really to talk to or who understands you. It would just be cool to have someone to hang out with or even just someone who wanted to talk to me.

I know my situation is pretty unique, but I’ve not really found anyone else who seems to be feeling something similar, even if it’s just feeling isolated. I guess the main reasons I wanted to post this were to vent, see if anyone is in a similar situation, and just to say I’m up for making friends if anyone wants to.

As far back as I can think (since I was young), I was afraid of dying, but, as I got older, those thoughts completely left my head. I guess that at times over the years, I have had a couple of small panic attacks about aging and dying, but, nothing that consumed me.

Over the last few weeks, I've had a rough patch in my personal life - my grandfather is in the ICU and my best friend was critically injured in a terrible car accident and barely survived.

Both situations have been hard on me, but, it's only been the last week or two where I have just been completely and irrationally consumed by thoughts of aging and dying. I just can't get it out of my head and I have not been able to be productive and focus on anything. It's not just severe anxiety about myself growing old and dying, but, about my friends and family as well, especially those that are older.

I have no idea what to do at all. This death anxiety has absolutely taken over my life and I'm miserable - I literally can't focus on anything. I feel this pain inside and it has completely consumed my life. Has anyone ever dealt with this? Is it because this is the first time in my life that I've had to deal with life or death tragedy involving people close to me?

Especially my dad, even though he is not the brightest I took a lot of his energy for granted. He loves telling stories and just talking in general and as a teen I thought it was annoying but now I love it when he talks. He is 64 and honestly that is getting old. I always tell him to be healthy and how he is feeling everyday because I want him to live a long time. At night is when my anxiety hits hard, maybe it has to do with the fact that I am alone in my room and its dark outside but damn every night for the past month all I think about is the end of life. Each ticking time is a countdown to death. I guess this is more of a rant to get things off my chest but I was also wondering if anyone had similar experiences as me. Honestly I have thought about suicide because these thoughts about life and death and just my pure existence is driving me insane. I am honestly crying as I type this because I just want to live the life I am facing right now, with my parents in the same house and where I can relax and not worry. But all I do nowadays is worry.

I want to protect my parents who are still too skeptical to get it, and I qualified so I decided to get it. It didn’t hurt at all, less than even a flu shot. My arm is getting sore but that’s normal with anything.

2638,Amygct,1613267198,"So, this is quite a piece of info I’m about to write. Hopefully it all some how makes sense. I’m also not English so forgive me for any typing mistakes.

Recently I made a timeline with my therapist and we came to the conclusion I have felt unsafe ever since I turned 5 years old. I had a unsafe home where I struggled with mental and physical abuse. When I turned 13 this changed and me and my mom escaped. Starting a whole new life was hard for someone who went through difficult stuff. Somehow I managed finishing school whatsoever. My confidence was rock bottom and I struggled with social anxiety heavily. I did manage to make a few friends. Not that I really found the correct group of people for me at that time though. I started smoking marijuana quite often and I usually didn’t felt good with. There are 2 situation that really sticks in my memory. 1 was a very bad anxiety attack at school in my classroom. Keep in mind my social anxiety already was pretty bad at the time, so that was kinda traumatic. The other 1 was with magic mushrooms (the first and only harddrug I used) and that didn’t work out great either. A few months later after these experience on the age of 17 I started to get panic attacks often and this is where things really went out of control for me. Slowly I became to lose everything I was able to do in the past. Going to school, taking busrides, doing groceries, visiting family, visiting friends became all things of the past. I went to therapy for 2 years, but I didn’t made any improvement, so they decided it was time to go for me. Looking back at it, I wish I went looking for a different psychologist way sooner, because the help I did get wasn’t very professional. After that I needed to wait 10 months before I had a new appointment with a therapist (yeah the waiting lists are horrible where I live). In that time I became more and more stuck at home. Even simple walks became hard till the point I couldn’t manage it anymore. I also development new fears in another category (although these fears in public already had something to do with losing control). I was/am basically afraid someone sees something is wrong with me, so everything I feel I tend to put away which results in some kind of freezing mechanism. I basically feel paralyzed by the anxiety. I’m not really aware of everything around me, although I am, but it’s hard to explain. It’s like I’m on constant base busy fighting of the anxiety. Anyway, back to that period of time without help and where I developed fears from another category. The thought of me being a psychopath became a lot more of a issue. I started to get stuck in fearful thoughts like hurting people. I started to believe I was the worse person on planet earth. This resulted in me fearing a lot more then I already did. Certain colors, numbers and food types didn’t felt good anymore. I started to lose more and more the feeling of feeling connected with other people and my social anxiety even increased. (where I thought I already was on the max) I started to avoid watching tv and movies, because every time I had this feeling of weirdness and not feeling connected which is a hard feeling to explain. And I also had these negative thoughts about people which are maybe the worst. It feels like it goes automatically. And that I constantly have to battle it. As you might understand, this drowns your energy entirely. In general I started the world started to feel weird and fearful which is also another thing which is hard to explain. It’s more of a constant feeling. I also became to fear having schizophrenia, paranoia and more mental diseases. Or I was just the worst person ever. The last fear I want to mention is the fear of darkness. I’ve tried to find other people who also had this specific fears, but I couldn’t find anyone. Darkness for me are stuff like demons and such. I know, it probably sounds very weird to you, but I can’t help myself with it. Well, I probably forgot a few things to mention, but after some time I finally went to therapy. And unfortunately, this also didn’t made a difference. I started to feel more and more depressed. I regularly have the thoughts of giving up, but some how I also know I can’t do it. So here I am, a 21 year old male on the absolutely lowest point I couldn’t even imagine. Life feels like a nightmare I can’t escape from. I can’t see a single sparkle of light at the moment. I’m still living with my mom, which I am grateful for, but I’m afraid I can’t ever take care of myself. Finding a partner, which is a whole other story feels like something I have to put out of my mind as well. I just don’t want to hurt someone and I try everything I can not to make that ever happen. I’m afraid at some point I’ll lose that mindset. I already feel so not connected to anyone. Just looking at people gives me anxiety. I do have some kind of therapy at the moment, but it’s in early stages, so I can’t tell if it will help me. But if fear it’s not, because nothing I did made a positive change yet. I’m also on antidepressants (which was a huge step to take), but I don’t experience a positive change from that either. 


So, diagnose wise it’s very vague for me. I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety, depression and add. The types of fears I created later on I think I can place them the best under ocd, although I don’t want to diagnose myself from the internet. I’ve did a ton of googling and I started thinking of having tons of mental diseases, which only makes me more hopeless. PTSD is something I haven’t mentioned before, but might also be a option. But again, my mind also thinks I might be a psychopath so I don’t know.

So, I’ve been on 10 mg Lexapro for years. I’m also on a PPI for reflux, and Vitamin D3 for a deficiency. 

About a month ago, I made the stupid decision to throw an OTC probiotic into the mix and also was going heavy on protein shakes and energy boosting teas. Last week, I went to the ER for severe adominal pain. I was also experiencing extreme gas and bloating. ER couldn’t find anything wrong with me, gave me cocktail of anti nausea meds and a shot of Hydromophone. I stopped the probiotics immediately. Been off the shakes and teas for two weeks. While the stomach issues have resolved (ironically I’m currently on Flagyl due to an unrelated infection, possible SIBO flare), the brain fog/depersonalization/anxiety is still there. I even cut my Lexapro down today 5mg today but no noticeable changes. 

I honestly think I have Serotonin Syndrome. If I do, would the Lexapro need to be stopped for the symptoms to diminish? From my understanding, you need to remove serotonin completely from your system before you can recover from SS.

Within an hour I felt very dizzy and giggly -- very similar to being drunk or stoned. Today I feel exhausted and my brain is very foggy (I only took the one dose at night). I think my psychiatrist downplayed the side effects, because she said they're pretty minor and most people just feel a bit sleepy. I did a bit of searching online today and found that many people experience side effects like exhaustion, brain fog, and dizziness intensely *and* long-term (i.e. they don't subside after a couple of weeks). I also read that tapering off the medication can be pretty hellish.

I have chronic pain and was really hoping Pregabalin would help with a couple of different issues, but I don't want to feel like a zombie as I try to push through these first couple of weeks only to find that it doesn't get better.

Hearing: spent more time at home and became extremely focused/anoyed/stressed by the sounds my neighbours were making. Their loud speaking voices, random thumps, doors slamming shut, subwoofer.. You name it. It got so bad I'd find myself muting the tv and putting my ear to the (shared) wall only to get more aggravated when I learnt they were making the music. All this seriously changed my hearing and now I pick up low frequency noises EVERYWHERE. They're all traceable (dryer, car driving up the street, doors slamming shut, subwoofer, even my own subwoofer seems to hit my ears diffetent). Anyway, my brain/ears pick this up everywhere now and it triggers physical issues. I become short of breath, my heart starts pumping and its almost like I forget how to breath. I can't control that reaction anymore. Went to en ENT specialist he send me home saying there's nothing wrong and it's probably just stress. I've lived here for 5 years. How the hell can my ears suddenly pick up sounds I've never heard before? 

Vague symptoms: I'm at a point where I'm feeling these palpitations, shortness of breath, change in hearing EVERY day now.. Even while relaxing. I think I've overloaded my sensory system or whatever that my body literally doesn't know how to relax anymore. I barely sleep at night..

I still do it when I need to, but I always need to catch my breath when I finally made it back to my car. Almost like having small panic attacks.

We’ve been speaking to each other for quite a few months but we’ve only been properly seeing each other for 6-7 weeks, things went as far as to say we were in a relationship, throughout this all there been a performance anxiety issue in the bedroom on my part. This has been especially hard for her since her previous relationship ending due the same reason. Things between us had stopped and started a few times due to this until last week when she understandably couldn’t take it anymore and we put a hopefully temporary hold on things. 

This isn’t my issue as I complete understand why she’s done so and I’m actually quite proud of her for doing so as I know it would have been very difficult for her to do. 
My issue is last week just before things stopped we added each other on Facebook, neither of us use it much so it hadn’t been a big deal till then. She had told me however that up until recently hers still said she was in a relationship with her ex despite them having broken up months ago, the reasons for this she made clear and are too personal for me to say on here but I was comfortable and accepted her reasoning. But a few days after we agreed to cool things off I went to go on her profile and found out she had removed me. I kinda of understood this as her ex and a family member of hers showed up in my ‘people you may know’ so I assumed I showed like that in a similar way, plus I didn’t really want to bring up her removing me as my mental health has not been great recently so didn’t have the strength to. 

I’ll admit I’ve been a bit upset about the whole thing so I have been periodically checking her profile wondering if I should bring it and today when I did this I noticed that her relationship status had changed, and then later in the day it said she was in a relationship with her ex again. This upset me obviously as a chronic over thinker I assumed the worst despite being okay with what she had told me about this happening before, and then even worse a few hours later she blocked me on Facebook. I’m honestly so confused as we are still speaking to each other and following each other on other socials, and if she had changed her relationship status back for the same reason she told me then I’d be okay with it, I’m very understanding and empathetic so would understand especially when we are no longer together in that way. 

Basically I don’t know if I’m being taking for a mug and being far too understanding, or that my abandonment issues are preventing me from seeing what she’s done is not a nice thing to do.

2661,Many_Statistician830,1613258579,"I've been in this situation for over 25 hours. I can't sleep. It's a chain of bad events. Every thought has negative feedback, with every passing second it amplifies. I feel like maybe telling, and thinking about all this would make me feel better and ground me in the reality.

It started with my friends calling me 29.40 hours ago. They were having a little party (5 people including me) and wanted me to come too. I didn't want to go because there was gonna be a curfew in a few hours and I was afraid of getting caught. Also I was afraid of them having corona and making me ill. They told no one was feeling strange. I refused the offer feeling sad. Then curfew began and another friend of ours went to the party with his car, and they called me again to tell me that they could pick me up by car, I thought since going to their house with the car would be faster than walking, it would reduce the time spent outside and the chance of getting caught would decrease, even though a car is very easy to spot. I was feeling sad so I decided to go. That was a mistake. How could I have made such a stupid mistake?

A bit of time passed. One friend had made a homemade whiskey with ethyl alcohol. 3 of them tasted it with the same glass, I didn't drink from it because I'm afraid of contagious diseases, those that are transmitted by saliva.

After some time has passed, we accidently saw a message coming to this friend's phone, it was read ""get well soon"". So I began to get paranoid if he had corona but he explained he might have syphilis but he wasn't professionally diagnosed. I felt good about my call on not drinking with the same glass and I positioned myself even further away from him.

I didn't want to drink the homemade alcohol at first, but then everyone wanted to drink so I drunk as well. The guy that made it is a bit of an alcoholic, he said he was drinking it all the time, and I felt better since everyone drunk it. It wasn't even that much, we didn't get even a bit drunk and we drunk already ""normal"" alcohol before that.

Some time has passed and everyone went to sleep. I couldn't sleep because I got very anxious if it had methanol in it, methanol poisoning makes you blind at best and kills you at worst. I researched methanol poisoning until the morning, and at one point I read that ethanol that is being sold might have methanol in it, even if it's a %10 chance. I think I got the hardest anxiety attack of my life, I started hyperventilating, my heart rate got faster, I felt like passing out and puking. It took some time to calm myself. I started to plan how I would go to hospital to ask for a blood test or anything. That was also scary because as far as I know selling ethanol is illegal. He had some friends. 

Since I read about all the symptoms of methanol poisoning and I started to get very paranoid, I started to check myself every two seconds, If I had blurry vision, trouble walking, trouble thinking, If I was feeling light headed or I was wanting to puke. Since the anxiety made me wanna puke I started to mix the two symptoms together and I just drove myself into this endless pit even more. Heart rate getting faster. Do I have blurry vision? Can I walk well? It was hell until morning, I fell asleep at the couch reading articles on the subject. Woke up 3 hours later, told everyone about the symptoms, told them to call every one of us instantly if they have it and then go to hospital. 

I went home. Home always feels better. I was feeling good for a bit. Currently I'm staying with my old man, so I explained my anxious thoughts and he said it's okay don't worry. I felt good for a while. Throughout the day I couldn't sleep at all, felt anxious all the time, it's read that symptoms begin in 12-30 hours, I got more paranoid at every second passing by.

It's been 15 hours since I got home. 2 hours ago I masturbated to take my mind off this. After I started to hate myself for it, smoked a cigarette and started feeling those symptoms again, the classic. 

I didn't want to wake up my father because I don't want to and I don't want to be judged and I don't want these thoughts to become reality, going to hospital etc. It's another bumpy road of anxiety.

I can't even describe it, every thought makes it worse, It's like I'm digging my own grave because every thought is negative feedback and it all loops back. I was almost gonna go to the ER for psychiatry, now that 22 hours has passed since drinking, poisoning seems unlikely but my mental health seemed to be standing on a very thin rope. I couldn't stop my thoughts. I thought I was sure losing it. I tried to ground myself to reality because I have this problem from time to time, I can't watch movies or play games for too long because it feels like I'm losing my grasp with reality, so I have to take a break and watch, listen, feel familiar things. I tried to listen to happy music literally and I fucking broke down crying and writing and listening to all this. I got bad so I wanted to watch something. It's just actually so fucking absurd, crying because of a panic attack while trying to watch Family Guy.

I'm feeling better right now. I didn't have to go the ER. Writing all this made me feel better. I still can't sleep, I still get the anxiety surges but it's managable. I don't want to make stupid decisions again.

I live in an apartment where you can hear almost everything. My neighbors have been really loud for over half a year with music and shouting and it ended with me and my SO filing a complaint (they did not open then door when we buzzed). I haven't lived in a place with quietness for 10 years (since I moved out from home). It has mostly been very loud music. I've finally moved in a family complex expecting children and normal noises (which is still annoying), not the loud music here as well.


I can't do more about the noise and I'm able to move in another apartment in two years. Now it's mostly during the day with the music, and most nights it's just loud talking. I have noise cancelling headphones which does the trick 2 out of 3 times and special made earplugs for sleep. But I now get anxiety just thinking about being home and imagining the music and noises, ""small"" noises like talking and normal volume music from the neighbors gives me full-blown panic attacks. I've never experienced the noise anxiety like this. I don't know what to do. Lockdown does not make it better. I try to be outside and away from home as much as possible. But this should have been my safe space. I'm currently not depressed but damn, this is not making it easier staying above water.

2682,foggyblades,1613251066,"Hey everyone. I need to just rant for a bit and I feel as if you all will understand me better than anyone in my real life. 

I should preface this by saying that I’m a 22 year old woman who has been forced back home after years studying. I have GAD but, in my years of being independent, was able to seek out therapists and learn to manage my anxiety until it became almost a non-issue. Until the last few weeks. 

So this year has been bad for my family. We’ve lost family members from old age (thankfully nobody has had the virus). My parents have been out of work due to the nature of their businesses. Happy things have been made stressful: my sister is heading off to university this year - in a couple months. But my mom is so worried about her - she believes she will not survive on her own. Or will be alone and depressed. See, my family all have troubles with anxiety. But this year and the circumstances we are in have clearly made things worse. My mom has developed some kind of panic disorder, often crying and collapsing on the floor in a fit of hallucinations. My father is equally as anxious, except he expresses his worries through violent statements and outbursts, like shouting “ I want to put a bullet in my head” or “fuck this life”. My sisters anxiety is purely triggered by these above mentioned scenarios so she will lock herself in her room whenever anyone else is anxious and avoid any conversation. 

This evening things hit the worst point ever. My mom had a panic attack due to me having to leave the home. I managed to contact a friend of hers to come and visit to calm her down. It was successful. My dad in this time decided to contact the person I will be living with in the future and told my mom about this conversation. My mom freaked out - I assume she felt like my father was bothersome and annoyed said person. She was in a fragile state, I assume. My father gradually blew up due to her disapproval, causing my mother to relapse in her panic attack. My father thus got angry and started his usual “fuck this life” shouting. He stomped off to bed, threatening to end his life tonight. My mother then came to me and told me how she wants to leave him but can’t because she doesn’t have a job nor is she independent. She is also worried about my sister who won’t have a home to come back to during her university holidays. 

And now I’m awake and alone in my room after having all of this forced into me.

I don’t know what to do. My family is falling apart. 

The anxiety that I had so long ago learned how to manage has resurfaced with a new face. 

And I’m terrified and so incredibly sad.

2685,strwrs12,1613250580,"  

I started dating my gf a few months ago in the summer. We chatted online and decided to go through with it and it was great for a bit but then her mental illnesses started showing themselves. They didn’t scare me away because I’ve dealt with my own things but no where near the level she has. The past couple months it has gotten really bad and being out of work I’m staying with her to help her out. Half the days she is fine, the other half she spends curled up in a ball, not speaking, either numb to her emotions feeling nothing or feeling everything at once and she can’t take it. I need help. I made a post earlier in the week but that was rushed so this is my attempt at a more substantial one.

A little background: my girlfriend has depression, anxiety, and sexual trauma, all since she was around 15 (25 now), so she’s been dealing with them for ten years. She has been in therapy with several therapists and psychiatrists over the years and in the beginning they helped but the last few years it has done nothing and she feels stagnated by it. She’s always waiting for them to give her “the answer” to fix her. It doesn’t help that she herself is a therapist, so she knows all the mechanisms to try and cope with what’s she’s been through and has tried them all, or worse she thinks because so knows the trick that it won’t work which makes it not work. She has suicidal thoughts and has cut herself in the past where her parents had her admitted to a psych hospital for a week after her boyfriend at the time told them. It was a horrible experience for her which has left her with feelings of abandonment both from being thrown into it and the ultimatum her boyfriend gave when she got out of leaving if she ever did that again.

She has been put on a dozen different meds and they either don’t do anything or make her feel like a zombie which does not help at all so she’s sworn those off. Her parents are no help because they just stress her out more when she goes to them and she has no siblings or friends, which makes me the only person she has. In fact, I’m the only thing she has. She’s said that when I’m not around, all she does it go to work, do chores, and sleep. She barely even eats half the time.

In terms of what she experiences, it’s a lot of feelings but it’s focused on three key ones. 

First, she gets overwhelmed and panicked about things, especially work. She can go into work one day with a list of what she has to do and feel good, but when the days starts she regrets ever going; maybe she had a larger work load than expected, a coworker is being rude, or something. This regularly gets compounded with her depression, her second key struggle. She either has a lot to do and panics, thinking she can’t do everything when she needs to and figures there’s no point, or is just lacking any energy to do anything at all. She doesn’t lack motivation or knowledge to do something, she just lacks energy. She feels incapable of moving and completely numb. Strangely enough, work helps because it’s something to keep her mind busy when she’s able to do it. She then feels compelled to always work and when she isn’t, then she has nothing to occupy herself and she gets depressed. The third issue is caused by her sexual trauma in that she doesn’t feel safe anywhere, especially by herself. Even when in her own apartment, she doesn’t feel safe. I help her feel a bit safer if we cuddle, but that doesn’t always work because sometimes I don’t feel safe. Because she has a history of cutting herself and has suicidal thoughts, she never feels safe, especially by herself, but she doesn’t trust herself.

One thing that really makes the whole thing difficult is when she randomly gets depressed at home. We’ll get up on Saturday and everything is good; we have coffee, chat, and play some games together, but after a bit, for no obvious reason either one of us can spot, she gets depressed and completely shuts down. At first, she stares blankly with a frown and doesn’t say anything. That lasts for a half hour or so, then she curls up in a ball on the couch to try and feel safe and says, “I ruin everything”, which seems to be her depression catch phrase. She stays like that either for a few hours or the entire rest of the day, usually retreating to the bedroom to sleep. Now her new thing is she’ll want to just leave the apartment without a coat or anything (dead of winter here) because she “needs to go”. I then stop her and she just leans against the door depressed for an hour or two before going back to her room.

So, she gets a bit depressed, but then being depressed gets her even more depressed as well as angry because she feels she’s ruined our time together. In fact, what I described happened just today even. However, when she went to try and leave she said she wasn’t depressed but angry at both herself and me; with herself because, like I’ve said, she think she’s ruined everything, but also with me because she thinks I’m lying about caring about her and I’m going to leave like everyone else. She think’s I’m only helping because I’m obligated to. That part really hurt me. Of course, I know she doesn’t mean it, but it still hurts. I want to help her with her laundry, with dinner, with groceries, especially when she’s not able to. Though, when I do, she feels bad about it because I’m taking too well care of her and she doesn’t do anything. I don’t need her to care for me though. I don’t need much, just someone to hug and whom I know will be there for me, but she thinks that’s not enough and so she get even more angry with herself.

So, me helping her hasn’t gotten anywhere. I’m not trying to be her therapist, but if I can I want to help. In my last post about this, some people suggested things like gaming friends online or to find a hobby or get outside some more. Unfortunately, the idea of friends does not track well with her because of her abandonment. Hobbies are but a fleeting fancy for her so she quickly tires of them and then feels depressed because she can’t find happiness in anything. In the past she’s like art and knitting and music, but those don’t bring her any joy anymore and nothing new does. As for outside, she does enjoy it when she’s in a good mood, but when she is depressed it does nothing. Nothing does anything when she is depressed.

I wish I could say I’ve been perfectly alright throughout this, but it’s starting to get to me. At the moment I’m looking for work so I’m able to stay with her and help out whenever she needs it, but I worry of what will happen when I get a job and can’t spend at much time helping. I also worry about how long I can keep doing this. Like I said, her saying I don’t care about her hurt but I can take it for now. What if we are together for several years and she’s saying things like that every week, even if she doesn’t mean it? Will my time with her be half her being alright and the other half she’s depressed, angry, anxious, and to angry to do anything that she hides in her room? I also worry if she is even ready for a relationship. She’s been in ones since she was 15 but maybe that’s the problem. Maybe she never learned to be by herself and that’s why she’s struggling. Whichever it is, I’m wondering how much longer I can keep this up. But even if I do decide I take do it any more and we break up, then I’m just going to be proving her right that everyone leaves her and I worry about what she’ll do to herself if that happens. 

So how do I help her? Has anyone else ever had depression, anxiety, etc. so bad that you’ve gone through what she is? So bad that therapist and meds do nothing and you only have one person in your life? What can she do? But also, if I can’t help her, what do I do? Like I said, I worry that if I leave she’ll harm or kill herself. How can I make a decision like that?

Obviously there is a lot and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read so if you need me to clarify anything, I’ll try my best.

TL/DR: She has depression, anxiety, sexual trauma, and abandonment issues. I’m all she has. Her only family is her parents who don’t help and she has no friends. She feels angry and unsafe with herself and so only works or sleeps and half the time can’t do anything. I want to find something to help her but the standard go out for a walk or learn to be thankful kind of stuff does nothing for her.

I do have a good job and I am good at it, it pays well too. Impartial observer would probably think that I am a successful man with that new car and all. But outside of work, there is nothing. I am undoubtedly affected by being dumped couple days ago, no question about that. It happens. If only I wasn't rejected a month ago by another woman and if only I hadn't broken up a long lasting relationship another month before that. It's just been too much to bear.

It would be amazing to have a good friend on two to lean on in a time like this. But, I have none left. Except for my sister and ex girlfriends, there wasn't anyone who would message or call me on their own in good 5 or 6 years. Maybe I haven't invested enough effort in those friendships, but I never felt like they were real, you know. Out of sight, out of mind. They never really deeply cared, so I stayed out of the way and it ticked away.

What will I do next? I don't know. I will probably finish tiling the bathroom for the day, go back to the other apartment, turn on YouTube to have at least the speaker taking to me, eat, go to bed... Wake up and just do it again for no reason but to stay alive. Maybe on Monday a colleague will call me and I will actually have a reason to speak after several days without saying a word to anyone. Probably not, they are used to mailing me anyway. I should drink before I head out though, there is snot everywhere and I must have cried out at least half a litre of water by now.

Part 1:

If Super Mario has 3 lifespans, I have infinite lifespans. Each Anxiety crisis I die and resurrect and Even if I overcome, I always dead tired after the crisis. 

I feel that I fight within myself in a way similar to the wars between countries or the civil war of the country, or I am like the debris that occurred after the earthquake. Civil war is a more accurate analogy, as it is a crisis I live in myself.

Everything is happening inside and in my head. During the crisis, I have great fear and delusions in my head due to the effect of my subconscious.

My brain is trying to shut itself down and creates a wall around itself. In addition to these, a wall is forming around my brain. The thought of not being able to overcome forces me to stay in the wall and it feels like I cannot get out. The wall suffocates me. It feels like I'm trapped inside the wall. With the state of uncertainty, it feels like electric currents are forming in my brain and these will short-circuit and turn off the switch. This electric current prevents me from thinking.

During the day, when my mood is on its way, suddenly everything turns upside down, chaos ensues. I cannot get involved in the conversation around me. During the crisis and after, There is no talkative me.

Part 2

During university, out of the blue, I often was furious and I felt angry. I couldn't understand it cause there was no reason. Okay, sometimes there was/were the reason(s). If then, It was okay because I knew reason(s). I always was an average student. I didn't have any ambition. Neither success nor failure student. If I were an ambitious person, I would understand angry and fury. If there was nothing, why did I feel angry? 

In 2012, I graduated from university with my GPA of 2.20 out of 4. I was unemployed until December 2013. Early in 2013, My brother offered a job in the family company. Actually, The offered job was ""come and help"". I refused after three workdays. From the beginning, I didn't want it. I knew I couldn't improve myself in the family company. I don't have any problems with him. My brother and my uncle are smart, responsible and example people. I love them. however, working family business is not fit in me.

Anyway, In November 2013, I got a job interview with the company which I've been working for since December 2013. The interviewer ask what did I want. I replied, ""I wasn't a tendency to economy, finance and money things, so I opted political science and public administration, I didn't choose the department of economics, that's why HR would be a good option for me if you considered it appropriate.""

Once orientation training started, I assumed I was HR personnel but when it was over and my first workday, I was told I began to work in the Finance department. I knew myself, I still know myself. There is no tend to the economy for me. Starting work in the finance department was a shock to me. That time, I hadn't had a vision. I did mistakes every week, every day. I couldn't fix it. I lost my feelings and self-trust, I was always worried about my future. According to me, I was a failure in the finance department.

I felt myself a ticking time bomb in May 2014. I couldn't overcome it myself. I needed to get help, so It was the right time I decided to see a therapist which I kept a secret from my family. From June, I went therapist regularly.  After a while, she advised going to a psychiatrist. I did. I guess, In autumn 2014 I was diagnosed with anxiety by the psychiatrist and he explained. I understood angry and furious which I felt out of blue in university.

I've been using antidepressant since 2019 summer and My Anxiety has been undulating, however, today, I can control it I'm better compared to the past. I was an utmost shy asocial person. Let me give example;

In high school, There was math exam in which we had to solve 10 out of 20 questions. I looked at the paper, I told myself, Okay My score would be 90 out of 100, Self-confidence was high and I knew myself. Before I hand over the paper to the teacher, I noticed some mistakes in a question but I couldn't erase my mistake answer because of a broken hand and I couldn't ask a favor for erasing it. Okay, 80 out of 100 was fine, I gave the paper. Yes, The Teacher gave me 80 for my paper.

In high school, I couldn't fittingly chat with ladies. Actually, ladies' students were a minority group. The ratio was 8 boys to 1.7 girls. Anyway, I was shy.  University wasn't superb, but a turning point. It was a turning point in my life. Because I noticed my shyness which I had to overcome in prep school and I've overcome it within a decade. Maybe, It is a long time but I did.

I graduated in 2012. I began to work in December 2013. I've been improving myself for I noticed my shyness. I can talk ladies, I have lobby such as Lego, Wikipedia, and recently animation. Between 2019 October and 2020 February, I went gym, four days a week. Almost every weekend, I went to see a movie or theatre, sometimes friends or cousins, sometimes all alone.

Most importantly, I've traveled alone abroad since 2017. I joined the tour company on my First second trip. On the third travel, I was completely alone, with no friends or anyone. I was free, I am still free. Every year, I did travel abroad two times. (except 2020, just one travel)

Today, I'm happy,  Everything is fine. I try to simple.

2693,Kimsys,1613248084,"Spending all this time at home made me realize that the root cause of my social anxiety is that my parents never let me socialize/have any after school activities in high school. It was mostly a mix of them being protective + not being home a lot to drive me anywhere (Uber wasnt a thing yet). So a lot of the times I was often left home alone and the only form of interaction I’d get would be from people on the internet (Tumblr, Twitter). 

As an adult, I know I’m responsible for this now, but I can’t help but think about all that wasted time and how I’d be a little bit less anxious around others now if I’d been allowed to go to camps and normal stuff like that.

2698,SleepRelaxationZen,1613246067,"Hi there ☺️

I am new to Reddit, and have never really done stuff like this before. I joined this forum to see how others deal/dealt with their anxiety and worries, and to see if I can relate and if anyone can relate with me! 

So I first noticed my anxiety a few years ago now when I was working one of my first proper office jobs for a big national corporation based in the heart of London. I didn’t see eye to eye with my manager as I felt as I was the young/inexperienced employee I found a lot of mistakes (even when I was following instructions or I wasn’t even involed) was blamed on me. When I’d bring this up to management I was told “not to worry it doesn’t concern you” even though it was my name which was being slandered. I would often hear from other colleagues that management had told them that I was “hanging by a thread” or “they want my head on a stick”. This was when my anxiety started. I often found it didn’t start until I went to bed though, and my thoughts would take over. I found myself getting 2/3 hours a night with the rest awake with worry that tomorrow was going to be my last day and I’d be let go, letting my family down and not being able to get another job. 

This was when I stumbled upon relaxing ambience videos on YouTube, whether it was watching the snow fall around a log cabin, or watching traffic pass on a highway. I found if I would relax, and watch these videos with no distractions it would take my mind off the daily struggles I was facing. I would often try sleep paralysis whilst watching these videos and try to imagine myself away from my current day to day, and in freedom in the middle of nowhere gazing up at the stars, or watching the burning log fire in the middle of the forest. Over time whenever I started to worry I would take a deep breath and imagine myself in that scenario, I guess it was a separate world for me where my thoughts didn’t take over?

I have told friends about this who I know also suffer from anxiety, and have since used these videos to meditate, relax, de-stress and often although very rarely now (I’m no longer in the the awful job) to help my anxiety. 

Being in this pandemic and lockdown has made me think about how I felt a few ago when this was happening, and I want to try and help others who also suffer from anxiety. I have also started my own YouTube channel and videos to try and help others. 

If you’re reading this and you’re going through a tough time, I want you to know that you’re not alone and not to sound cliche but their is a light at the end of the tunnel. The sun will come out when the rain passes so stay strong and know you’re not alone.

However, if an injection was all a vaccine was then I wouldn't really be so worried as injections themselves are very quick and then they're over. 

I'm more just scared about the side effects of vaccines. I have never gotten a flu shot but I remember as kid hearing that you get side effects as obviously a little bit of the flu is put inside you, which is again obviously the case with this COVID vaccine too. I was just reading on the NHS website that you can experience fatigue, aches, sickness, and a sore arm for a whole week after the injection.

Aches and a sore arm are the thing that's really giving me anxiety. That kind of stuff has always made me cringe ever since I was a kid. I'm very sensitive to touch, especially my arms which is probably part of what I have a phobia of needles, and I have always had anxiety about health and I'm just so scared of this happening.

I'm also kinda jealous of her beauty and her hijab since she is so pretty and I wish I could wear one although i'm not muslim. I am a girl who has lack self-confidence and had in the past other situations like this before.

It doesn't stop there.

So through insta, I somehow found her account which was public and clicked on it. Now we've all probably done this before of looking through people's insta accounts and that's what I did.

I've suffered from anxiety for most of my life. I didn't know what it was when I was younger and just thought I was too sensitive and worried. I lashed out a lot and was always scared that something was wrong with me health-wise.

I went on Lexapro a couple of years ago and that helped a lot. I was able to separate the ""bad"" thoughts (anxiety) from what was actually happening. For instance, if I'm feeling anxious I'll sometimes get chest pain. Before medication I thought I was having a heart attack. No one could convince me otherwise. After medication I could kind of take a step back and realize that I've had those feelings before and that it was most likely anxiety.

I've also felt like stuff isn't ""real"" since I was about 11-12, and I'm now in my early 30s. I know that I'm experiencing stuff but it's like I have to keep reminding myself that I am. It's almost like I'm seeing stuff but not really seeing it. It's so scary and I don't even remember what feeling normal is like. I saw a therapist for a couple of sessions and she said that some people with anxiety feel like me and that I could refer to it as feeling ""disconnected"".

After they split I stayed with my mom, and was very close with her. She took on the part of both parents, replacing my father who was ever evasive. The year I turned 30 she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and two years later she died a horrible death with me at her bedside. I was a mess, with guilt and fear.

Six+ years later I think I’m still struggling with the aftermath. I’ve had at least four major bouts with depression (likely more), and I’m now in my third period of anxiety. This last one started with my 2yo getting sick (infection, didn’t respond to antibiotics at first). Around the same time I had vague symptoms from last fall resurface in my body. Likely not entirely imagined, but objectively (I try) mild. This has turned into a now 2.5wk long period of visits to various doctors and specialists. Ultrasound, MR and meds (antibiotics, nsaids). Symptoms of the original condition come and go, but after the MR I foolishly opened the pics before getting professional feedback, and am now certain I see other issues in those. Symptoms have now moved to my spine (although some linger in the original spot). Nothing really indicates I’ve got cancer (to my knowledge, lacking professional review of MRI), but I can’t shake the feeling / fear.

Knowing I’m (in part) a mess, I realize some of this is in my head. And I’m fairly certain I’ve got illness anxiety, which isn’t much of a surprise, given my history. I have no idea how to deal with this though. I feel like I’m spending more and more of the mental shield I’ve built up since my last bout (through exercise and being outdoors).

2740,Immediate-Gur7036,1613235292,"Ok so at my school there is this girl who I don't know and never talked, just goes to my school and is really nice. She is really pretty, dress elegant, walk confidence, look and act highly confidence, she also wears the hijab which is the reason why i'm afraid of her and ik that sounds horrible, however, it's because she is so pretty and I admire her beauty and confidence. I'm also kinda jealous of her beauty and her hijab since she is so pretty and I wish I could wear one although i'm not muslim. I am a girl who has lack self-confidence and had in the past other situations like this before. Whenever I see her or walk pass her, my body freezes as well as my mind, my body tumbles/shakes with panic attack. Whenever this girl sees me, she notices my behaviour around her and probably thinks i'm strange. Now I had put myself in her shoes and pretend that I was her and she was me, and that she is human too and that were all equal, that still didn't help and I had worse panic attacks the more I think about her.

It doesn't stop there.

So through insta, I somehow found her account which was public and clicked on it. Now we've all probably done this before of looking through people's insta accounts and that's what I did. Something horrible happened while I was on her profile... I went through some of her highlights and accidently came across one that was on her story, which means she could she I view it. Somehow although she doesn't know me, just that weird girl who is scared of her, she end up blocking me!!!! bc because she thinks i'm a creep bc in her situation that would be so creepy. Right now i'm even more scared of her and I no longer see her anymore.

Right now guys I need a advice on how to stop being afraid of people who are confident and better then I am and obsessing over people. I also need help on psychology analyzing this situation so I can better understand myself and to see if I might have an anxiety disorder since I do have social anxiety",Anxiety,I Have Panic Attacks and Get Very Timid Around This Person,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lj473v/i_have_panic_attacks_and_get_very_timid_around/,1613206492.0

2743,narcissistickannibal,1613234509,"So I'm currently 23 years old, soon to be 24 years old, I'm female, and I suffer from anxiety, especially when it comes to socializing physically and over the internet, texts, etc. My social life now compared to when I was 11-12 really severely diminished after I got out of middle school, not by want, but by not having a choice at the time it felt like. People I'd considered friends just really began ignoring me for reasons I don't know to this day, but for years believed it was because I just wasn't that interesting. When I got to highschool they were out of nowhere just treating me like I wasn't there, didn't acknowledge my presence, even when around family members that also mutually knew each other. I tired my hardest to jump in, join the conversation no matter how painfully awkward it felt with their confused reactions sometimes, like confusion about why I was even talking to them. It was about two or three months into my freshman year when I practically begged my mom to please let me switch to school online, and thankfully she did allow me to. In that time I went through horrible depression, the feeling of not being wanted, and self isolation. Through it all however I managed to make a couple of friends, people who could make me smile and laugh, people who to this day still talk to me. After an extra year I did graduate highschool and got my diploma.
So fast forward to now, I have a Facebook and I rarely use it except for messenger to talk with family and my small group of friends. I don't post anything, don't really share anything, it's just an empty page with my profile picture and some likes. Out of nowhere earlier this week on Monday, someone I used to know adds me just randomly out of nowhere. I hesitated accepting, but felt rude not accepting. Not a single message they have tried sending me. Tuesday comes and once again, someone else added me that I used to know, again I accept and nothing. Friday hits and again out of nowhere, someone else.
I'm the type of person that I won't speak unless spoken to first, I'm not a huge talker, and so I really don't know how to deal with these people. They were the ones that decided I wasn't worth talking to anymore. Has anyone dealt with something similar before, how did you handle it?",Anxiety,Advice on Interacting With People I Haven't Spoken To In Years,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lj3xx3/advice_on_interacting_with_people_i_havent_spoken/,1613205709.0
