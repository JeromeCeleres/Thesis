(Editor’s Note: Below is an abridged version of the author’s story, “Lest We Forget,” which first appeared in a recent best-selling book on martial law, “Not On Our Watch.” After his martial law ordeal, Roberto S. Verzola went on to finish electrical engineering at UP, pioneered in the local computer industry and helped launch the green movement in the country. He currently promotes an ecologically benign method of farming and teaches math at UP.)
I graduated from Philippine Science High School in 1969 and entered the University of the Philippines (UP) the same year as a scholar of the National Science Development Board (now the Department of Science and Technology).
As a UP freshman on the Diliman campus, I was relatively unperturbed by the student activism that had begun to draw other members of my batch. Pampered as an honor student and government scholar, my future seemed secure.
The consecutive national elections of 1969, 1970 and 1971 were unique in Philippine political history. This string of highly political election years kept the nation in ferment, heightened the political awareness of the public, especially youth like us, and gradually brought the cauldron to a boil.
Things were coming to a head. As the specter of military rule started to become real, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) launched an ambitious effort to recruit from among radicalized activists. I was one of them.
On Aug. 21, 1971, the Liberal Party (LP) rally at Plaza Miranda was bombed, killing several people and almost decimating the LP leadership. Immediately, [President Ferdinand E.] Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus. The suspension basically allowed the military to detain anyone indefinitely. What seemed a theoretical possibility was now becoming real. Marcos was, indeed, hell-bent on extending his rule, regardless of constitutional prohibitions.
After the writ suspension, the movement, to me, became the Movement, and eventually the Revolution. My distaste for government corruption, my desire to do good for the poor, and my early commitment to stand by my country rather than adopt a new more prosperous one—values I had picked up at the family dinner table which led me to activism in the first place—were giving way to class consciousness, revolutionary fervor and communist ideology.
Life in the underground
The declaration of martial law on Sept. 21, 1972, swept my niggling questions under the rug. As we entered this dark period of recent Philippine history, my life in the underground began. I turned 20 in November 1972.
I was part of a group that consisted mostly of journalists and writers. I was assigned to a team that worked on an underground newspaper in Filipino, which we called Taliba ng Bayan. For almost two years, I was part of the group that published Taliba ng Bayan.
On Oct. 4, 1974, I was in a meeting with members of the [CPP] Manila-Rizal Committee in a UG house in Valenzuela, Bulacan, when armed men broke into the door and I found myself face to face with a gun.
Body blows
I felt myself freeze and blanch before the muzzles pointed at my face. Shouts of “Down! Down!” brought me to my senses and I lay face down on the floor, as the raiding team settled down to identify the captives. I was one month short of my 22nd birthday.
Of all the body blows, I found it hardest to deal with those to the solar plexus. Exhale all the air in your lungs. Then force more air out—twice, three times—until you can squeeze nothing more out of your lungs. Hold your breath as long as you can. Now try to breathe in. If you somehow cannot, that’s how it feels to get well-placed blows to the solar plexus.
It leaves you gasping for breath, for air that won’t come because of the cramp on your diaphragm. The physical pain of fists hitting skin, muscles and bones recedes to the background, until it’s just you and the air that won’t come. (I wonder if Sisa’s Basilio in Rizal’s Noli felt the same, hung upside down and dunked into a well?)
At one point, when I felt I was about give in (the bone of contention was my uncle’s home address), I told myself to last a little longer. A few seconds more, a few minutes more. No, not yet. Then they would pause for the questions. And we’d go one more round.
Subconsciously, I felt that giving away my uncle’s address would be giving away nothing at all. It would, on the other hand, inform my relatives and subsequently my parents that I was in military hands.
But then I didn’t want to impose on my uncle and my aunt the terror of getting raided in their home. My frustrated interrogators probably did not realize it, but they were testing not my loyalty to the Movement, but my filial love for Auntie Orang, a cousin of my father, and her husband Uncle Domeng, who gave me sanctuary in the earliest days of martial law when I had nowhere to go.
Electric shock
After my Isafp [Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines] ordeal, I was “borrowed” by another intelligence unit for further interrogation. Lieutenant Garcia of the Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group (MISG) took me to Camp Panopio along Edsa near the PC [Philippine Constabulary] headquarters.
I told them the same story. They didn’t believe me. So they brought in the machine. Two lengths of wire extended from it, both ending with bare wire, the insulation stripped. One end was tied around the handle of a spoon.
The machine is a field generator, with a wheel with a handle. It probably generates 40-60 volts and, if turned really fast, may give as high as ninety volts or even more.
My interrogators tied the end of one wire around my right index finger and inserted the spoon into my pants, on my right waist, until it rested where the leg meets the lower abdomen, near the crotch. My body would complete the circuit.
When I was young, I used to watch my uncles and older cousins as they slaughtered a pig. As soon as the pig realized something bad was going to happen, it would shriek for dear life.
Shriek of terror
It was a grating shriek of helplessness, desperation, and terror, one that rang in your mind long after the pig was dead.
It was that kind of scream that issued from my throat every time my torturers spun the wheel around. It was totally involuntary, the automatic response of a body invaded by an alien current of a thousand spikes snaking through one’s cells and nerves. I could stifle it no more than I could stop my hand from jerking away when shocked briefly by live house wiring.
Across the aisle were two civilian Metrocom employees. They were women, apparently on overtime. They went on with their work, as if they heard or saw nothing. Business as usual.
No sign of surprise or concern. Metrocom apparently used the electric shock treatment often enough to make its civilian employees inured to screams.
Soft drink bottle
After less than a week at the Ipil detention center, I was called to the office, told to pack my things, and taken to another intelligence unit, the dreaded 5th CSU [Constabulary Security Unit], for further interrogation.
Until then, I had no idea that a soft drink bottle could be used for torture. I was made to squat inside a room with the air conditioner fully turned on, and the session began.
What I got were not the hard body blows that I had endured in Isafp, but sharp taps on my limbs with a soft drink bottle.
These taps were unlike the jarring shock of a chest blow or the asphyxiating cramp of an upper cut to the solar plexus. They brought instead a gradually growing numbness that became an ache that grew sharper as muscle, tendon, ligament, and bone began to get sore and the nerves on the skin became even more sensitive to pain.
The taps weren’t done in a hurry. In fact, they came at a deliberate pace. Starting with the left upper arm, gradually going down to the elbow and the forearm. And then the right upper arm.
Then the legs, one at a time. The knees, and the shins, finally. Have you ever bumped your knee or shin into a hard object? Remember, that was a single bump.
When they finally gave up on me, I was so sore I could hardly move. Reddish blotches had started to erupt all over my limbs, which soon turned bluish-violet and then almost black. Parts of my arms and legs had literally turned black and blue from the beating.
Dark blotches would remain visible almost two months later. When the blotches became unnoticeable, I was allowed to have visitors.
Plaza Miranda bombing
It was in the 5th CSU where I first heard it told and confirmed that the Party chairman had secretly ordered the Plaza Miranda bombing.
This information was not forcibly extracted but freely volunteered to us by conscience-stricken Party leaders in prison who were in the midst of their own soul-searching, perhaps suffering from pangs of guilt that the confessions helped ease.
Kumander Dante (Bernabe Buscayno, then commander in chief of the New People’s Army), supposedly shed tears when he learned about the Party’s role. I did too.
The Plaza Miranda revelations were a watershed for me. So, the Party had been telling us lies. And I had echoed the lies too, recalling the pieces on the Plaza Miranda bombing I had written in the Philippine Collegian, Taliba ng Bayan, and elsewhere. I was wracked with questions and doubts.
I didn’t realize then how much worse it could get. But, in fact, it did. Purges had happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin, in China under Mao, in Cambodia under Pol Pot, and possibly elsewhere too, when communists were already in power.
In the late 1980s, before they had even won power, those who professed belief in national democracy and wanted a dictatorship of the proletariat in the Philippines prefaced their mission with an internal purge. This purge left nearly a thousand or so of their own members and followers dead—after a horrible ordeal of interrogation, torture, and eventually, execution in the hands of their own comrades.
Self-cleansing
Although I would not immediately renounce my commitment to the national democratic movement, fundamental questions would flood back and I would replay in my mind all the internal debates many times.
It would take not months but years of self-cleansing, guided by nothing but my own conscience, before I could again face the world with confidence in my own system of beliefs.
For our generation, the horrors of martial law were common knowledge, especially because the postdictatorship President, Cory Aquino, was herself the wife of one of its victims.
But when Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, following Marcos’ footsteps, was on the verge of imposing full military rule to cover up her own brand of corruption, yet not enough crowds formed to kick her out, I realized that subsequent generations never really knew what it meant to live under a dictatorship.
They have no memories of dictatorship. Unlike me, they don’t have marks on their bodies, bad dreams at night, or friends who died in the prime of youth to remind them.
When we of this generation go, our memories should not leave the world with us. No, we must never forget.

MANILA, Philippines – Victims of horrifying acts of torture during Martial Law recounted their painful experiences before Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno on Wednesday, August 31.
Etta Rosales, former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) who experienced the atrocities of the dictatorship, recounted: “They had a gun and they threatened me to answer the question, otherwise they [would] shoot [me].”
She was also raped, tortured, and went through electric shock and Russian roulette.
Rosales is among the petitioners asking the Supreme Court to stop the burial of the late dictator at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, which President Rodrigo Duterte had allowed supposedly for the country to be able to move on from that period of history.
Another petitioner in one of the cases, Trinidad Herrera, told the Chief Justice about her terrible experience under the dictatorship.
“‘Pinatanggal nila ang aking blusa at ‘nilagay ang linya ng kuryente sa suso ko. Pumasok pa ang kuryente sa katawan ko hanggang di ko na nakayanan,” Herrera tearfully recalled during oral arguments on the petition against a hero’s burial for the late president Ferdinand Marcos.
(They ordered me to remove my blouse and they applied electric shock on my breast. Electricity went through my body until I couldn’t take it anymore.)
“They even put water on the floor so that the electricity would enter my body,” she added in Filipino.
Another victim, Fe Mangahas, shared: “They would scare me again by touching me and breathing down my neck and then I felt something like naihi ako (I peed). I figured it was blood because at the time I did not realize I was two months pregnant.”
“When they found out I was pregnant I was released, but I was asked to report weekly about my whereabouts. I had to do this every Saturday for a year,” she added. Other victims also detailed what they went through when they were captured by uniformed men.
Maria Christina Rodriguez said her captors burned her skin with cigarette. Her fingers were swollen because of bullet-pressing.
Maria Christina Bawagan said her thighs were hit until they looked like rotten vegetables. She was sexually abused, with her captors inserting objects into her vagina and touching her breasts while blindfolded. She said she may never know who exactly tortured her, but she clearly remembered their voice.
Each of these women remembered the exact date they were captured and went through the life-scarring experience.
Sereno asked the petitioners, who are claimants for compensation under Republic Act 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparations Act, to speak before the court. She told them, “The Court is listening.”
Not about the money
During her interpellation of former Akbayan Representative Ibarra Gutierrez III, lawyer for one of the petitioning groups, Sereno asked if the monetary compensation for the victims was not sufficient.
Gutierrez responded: “No, your Honor, because the law explicitly acknowledges to recognize the [victims and their heroism and sacrifices].”
He also said that money is not equivalent to the restoration of dignity of the victims.
The late strongman’s state burial, he said, would “prolong and extend” the suffering of the victims.
Human Rights Victims Claims Board (HRVCB) Chairperson Lina Sarmiento, who was one of the resource persons invited, said that out of over 75,000 claims, they have only finished processing 17,000.
HCRVB can only start distributing the compensation after every case has been settled because the P10 billion funds allotted will be divided according to the intensity of human rights violations experienced by each victim.
Sarmiento said they are hoping to finish the work before May 12, 2018, when their office expires.
Non-repetition
Also appearing as a resource person, CHR Chairperson Chito Gascon said the state has an obligation for “non-repetition” of the trauma they experienced during Martial Law.
“There is a commitment on the part of the state [to] non-repetition, [that] the victims should not be exposed to re-traumatization,” he told Chief Justice Sereno.
Gascon stressed that local and international laws acknowledge reparations as a “positive act that the stake must undertake to [prevent] impunity.”

Pete Lacaba in the 70s
First published in Philippine Graphic, September 1995. Updated in the author’s blog in September 2008.
One week before the deadline for the submission of the depositions of torture victims, a friend called and asked why I hadn’t submitted mine. My friend said that if not enough depositions were submitted to the Hawaii court, the Marcoses would be proven right in their contention that they were not world-class torturers and executioners, and they would be justified in asking for a dismissal of the case.
What needed to be done, my friend pointed out, was not primarily to get financial reparation for the harm that had been done to us, but to prove to the world that the Marcos regime had indeed been guilty of widespread and systematic torture and extrajudicial executions. If the class suit said there were around 10,000 victims of human-rights violations under Marcos, then it needed to get as close to 10,000 depositions as it could.
My friend’s arguments persuaded me to write the following account, which was submitted along with the requisite forms just a few days before the deadline set by the court for the submission of depositions:
At dawn of April 25, 1974, on the second year of martial law, I was awakened by shouts of: “Open up! We are the authorities!” I looked out and saw that the house was surrounded by armed men taking cover behind jeeps and cars that had their headlights on.
As soon as I opened the door, the first man who came in shoved the barrel of his rifle into my stomach. Then somebody spun me around and forced me to lie face down on the floor. In that position, I was stepped on, kicked in the ribs, hit in the back and on the back of the head with rifle butts.
After the house had been searched and my two house companions were in custody, someone who acted as though he was in command (I would learn later that he was a first lieutenant, but not the head of the raiding party) dragged me into the bathroom and asked if there was a tunnel underneath us. I couldn’t help giving a short laugh, struck by the absurdity of the question. Angered by my response, he gave me a sudden blow in the chest with his closed fist. The lieutenant was an Arnold Schwarzenegger pumping-iron type, and at that time I was a 111-pound weakling. That single punch sent me reeling against the bathroom’s tiled wall.
The sun was up when we were taken in separate cars to Camp Crame in Quezon City, to the headquarters of the 5th Constabulary Security Unit (5CSU). After some routine questioning and filling up of forms in the office, I was taken to the back, the troops’ sleeping quarters. Constabulary officers and enlisted men--including a buck private who was himself under detention, for murder--took turns making me a punching bag.
Mostly I was pummeled with fists in the chest and the stomach. I was seated on the edge of a steel cot. My tormentors and interrogators sat in chairs or stood before me, hitting me each time a question was asked or an answer was unsatisfactory. Troopers passing by, on their way to their lockers or wherever, felt free to hit my nape or the back of my head with open palms or karate chops.
At one point I was made to half-squat with arms outstretched. One of my torturers then took a broom and slowly, methodically beat my shins with the broom’s wooden handle. Although he seemed to be hitting me with very little force, the cumulative effect of the beating caused my shins to swell and made it sore and sensitive for a few days.
At another point I was made to lie down with the back of my head resting on the edge of one steel cot, both my feet resting on the edge of another cot, my arms straight at my sides, and my stiffened body hanging in midair. This was the torture they called higa sa hangin (lying down in air), also known as the San Juanico Bridge, named after the country’s longest bridge, built during martial law and dedicated by Marcos to his wife, Imelda.
“Lying down in air” is difficult enough, since you have to contend with the pull of gravity. But even before gravity could take its toll, somebody standing close by would give me a kick in the stomach and bring my body down to the floor. The steel cot scraped skin off my nape as I slid down.
I was forced to “lie down in air” twice. The third time I simply refused to get up. I stayed crumpled on the floor and said, “You may as well just kill me. Go ahead and kill me.” That was when the torture stopped for the day.
I had been continuously tortured for about eight hours. Incredibly enough, we even had a lunch break. I forced myself to finish up the horrid prison food on the aluminum army tray that they placed before me, hoping that when they resumed hitting me in the stomach I would throw up in their faces. I never did.
I can no longer remember the exact sequence of events, but in the days that followed, during the fortnight when we were incommunicado and our families went desperately from camp to camp looking for us, I experienced various other forms of harassment and torture.
Once, while a deposition was being taken, the sergeant conducting the interrogation suddenly kicked me in the chest. We were both seated in one corner of the 5CSU office, face to face, and I insisted on answering only questions pertaining to myself, refusing to answer those that would implicate other people. After the nth “I prefer not to answer that question,” he raised his booted foot and gave me a kick in the chest that sent the chair on which I was seated skidding clear across the room. When the chair hit the wall, I fell to the floor.
On another occasion, a lieutenant reviewing my deposition made me stand in front of an air conditioner going full blast while he interrogated me. And he smiled when he saw that I was shivering uncontrollably.
On still another occasion, another lieutenant ordered me to close my eyes in the course of an interrogation. A hand that I assumed to be the lieutenant’s then slapped my closed eyes and my nape repeatedly, almost rhythmically.
Once, the detained soldier who had been one of my torturers on my first day took me out of the cramped prison cell that I shared with about 30 other political prisoners. He gave me a tongue-lashing for having poked fun at his rather unusual name. While he was spewing saliva in my face, his fellow soldiers gave me a few jabs in the ribs.
One day I was led out of the small prison cell, handcuffed, and made to board a jeep with three or four of the men who had tortured me on my first day. I thought for sure this was it, they were going to take me to wherever their killing fields were and blow my brains out. Instead, we went to a military hospital, the V. Luna in Quezon City. I recognized the place because it was there that my father, a war veteran, had died of cancer about a dozen years earlier.
It now seemed to me that my torturers were humane after all, that they would have me treated for the bruises on my nape and shins. But as soon as we were inside a doctor’s clinic in one of the wards, I was blindfolded with my own snot-splattered handkerchief, made to lie down on the examination table, and injected with what I would later surmise to be a “truth serum.” In a couple of minutes I felt like I had downed half a case of beer. My head swam, and my body seemed to float. Once again the third degree began. I can remember talking drunkenly and trying to give misleading answers that would still somehow sound credible to my interrogators.
I don’t know how long the interrogation took before I finally lost consciousness. It was dark when I was roused from sleep, taken to the jeep, and brought back to my prison cell. They had to half-carry me all the way. My legs felt like jelly, and I didn’t seem to have any control over any part of my body, although I kept mumbling my own mantra: “Mind over matter, mind over matter...” The mantra didn’t work.
About two weeks after my arrest, I was taken to the office of the lieutenant who had slapped my closed eyes. He said my wife and my mother were in the other room. They had finally found my place of detention. But the lieutenant said he would only allow me to see them if I would name one name and give one address of a person involved in the underground resistance. “Have pity on your wife and your mother,” he said. “They would very much like to see you.” After a few moments of agonizing, I said I couldn’t do it. He eventually let my wife and my mother come in and talk to me for about ten minutes, but not after subjecting them for a much longer time to the mental torture of knowing I was just in the other room and fearing they would not be allowed to see me.
I was detained without charges for close to two years. In the first six months of detention, I was made to wash cars and clean the enlisted men’s incredibly filthy latrines. Halfway through my detention I experienced a recurrence of the pulmonary tuberculosis of which I had already been cured before martial law. I had to be confined for about a month at the Quezon Institute, a hospital that specializes in tuberculosis cases. Three shifts of prison guards kept me company.
On the basis of close to 10,000 depositions similar, I suppose, to the one above, the Hawaii court declared the Marcoses guilty of human rights violations and ordered them to pay a billion plus, in dollars, as reparation to the claimants in the class suit.
It was, I thought, primarily a moral victory. I joked about what I would do with the loot, but I didn’t really believe there was any way the government or the Marcoses would give a billion plus, in dollars, to victims of human-rights violations, quite a number of whom remain not only nonconformist but also active, militant, even dissident.
Today the papers tell me that a deal is being worked out: if the Marcoses and the government agree to pay 100 million dollars, the claimants will drop all charges against the Marcoses. This is supposed to be a win-win-win solution.
I don’t know what to think. I have friends among both those who defend and those who denounce the deal, and I don’t know what to think. I could be a million dollars richer, but if the Marcoses are absolved of their crimes against humanity, then what I wrote about how I was tortured would turn out to be a lie, a figment of my overheated imagination.

As we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law on September 21, 1972, InterAksyon.com posts a series of testimonies from human rights victims of the Marcos regime. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered, tortured, or disappeared in the 14 years the country was under a dictatorship. 
After the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986, close to 10,000 human rights victims – the survivors themselves or their families – filed a class suit against the Marcos estate. A US district court in Hawaii ruled in January 1995 that the victims are entitled to a share of the ill-gotten wealth recovered from the Marcoses: a total of $2.7 billion for their torment and torture.   
However, the legal victory remains only on paper. The Hawaii ruling has to be enforced in the Philippines by a local court. The Makati Regional Trial Court is currently hearing the case but the Marcoses have so far been successful in blocking compensation to the plaintiffs.
So far, only $10 million, or $1,000 each, has been awarded to the victims and their kin. The money is not even part of the $2.7-billion compensatory and exemplary damages awarded by the Hawaii court but is from a settlement with Marcos crony, Jose Yao Campos, who has real estate properties in Texas and Colorado.
In college, Josephine “Jo” Dongail hated her anti-Marcos activist-schoolmates in U.P. Diliman. The then hippie, peace-loving Dongail denounced the protesters “because their rallies caused nothing but traffic congestion.”
Little did Dongail expect that she, too, would later become a victim of the Marcos regime. In 1978, while working as a technocrat at the government-run Development Academy of the Philippines, the then 25-year-old Dongail was arrested and interrogated by the military in Camp Crame for 24 hours due to her link to her DAP boss, Horacio “Boy” Morales Jr., who went underground.
Fear gripped Dongail during her weeklong incarceration. Thinking that it was already her time, Dongail didn’t feel any hunger.  “I was just thirsty but there was no toilet in the stockroom-like area where I stayed. I had no choice but to pee in an empty bottle of Coke.”

“Every night they took 10 men, made them dig their graves, then shot them dead. Every night they also took 10 women to the boat, and raped them.” — Abunawas Kali 
Abunawas Kali was a young government employee in Maguindanao province during Martial Law. His two uncles, Amay Sandalia and Usop Kabalu, had survived the Manili massacre in Carmen, North Cotabato in 1971. The two men lost their respective wives — Pakutao Gani and Maysalam Kabalu, each with three children seven years old and younger — in the carnage by soldiers who shot dead 70 Moros inside a mosque.
Kali asked his two uncles to stay at his house and work in his rice mill in Bulibud village, Sultan Kudarat, along with another uncle, Hajitahir Rasul. Kali was then working in the municipal office in Parang and went home only on weekends. Rasul’s wife, children and sister also lived in Kali’s place.
In 1974, Kali was in Parang when soldiers of the 35th infantry battalion came to the house in Bulibud at dawn and fired randomly. They roused the sleeping residents, and made Kali’s three uncles line up on one side, and the two women and two children on another. The soldiers even wanted the 11-year-old boy to line up with the men, but his mother pleaded to keep him by her side. Then the soldiers shot the men, firing squad-style.
The women and children took the chance to escape, jumped into the river and swam to the other side. It was Kali’s aunts, Saynab and Sawad Rasul, and the latter’s two children, Udin and Bakungan, who lived to tell Kali about what happened. Kali’s niece, Bakungan vividly recalled the soldiers used “a gun with a magazine belt” — an M60 machine gun — to fire at the three men.
The soldiers then looted the Kali family home, carting away the antique Muslim heirloom. Then they burned the house and the rice mill, razing 75 sacks of rice and all of Kali’s important documents and belongings. The soldiers were also seen carrying away Kali’s uncle, Hajitahir Rasul, whose body was never found.
“Grabeng pagmasaker, grabeng ginawa ng militar sa Muslim,” Kali bitterly said, recalling the sad fate of his uncles.
That same year, in September, 20 more of Kali’s relatives were killed in the gruesome “Kulong-kulong massacre” in Palimbang town, Sultan Kudarat province. Some 1,500 Moros were killed when soldiers attacked the coastal town and gathered thousands of residents of seven villages, and detained them in the Tacbil mosque.
“Every night they took 10 men, made them dig their graves, then shot them dead. Every night they also took 10 women to the boat, and raped them,” Kali recalled the story by one of the survivors, his cousin, Bainkung Buwisan. Buwisan was then 14, and was raped, along with other women who were herded into a Philippine Navy boat where they were assaulted and raped. Those who resisted committed suicide by jumping into the ocean, or were shot dead by soldiers.
Kali said his cousin still clearly recalled the name of the Navy boat “Occidental Mindoro” and had the number “99.” Buwisan is now one of the Moro claimants under Republic Act 10638, or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act.
“Even though I was pregnant, I was not exempted from torture.”  — Loida Magpatoc
She was given the water cure. While she lay on her back, water dripped from a jar placed about three feet above her head. After about 15 minutes, she lost consciousness.
Sometimes, her captors played darts, using her face as the dartboard. The worst was the Russian roulette: a soldier placed a single bullet in a revolver, spun the cylinder, placed the muzzle against her head, and pulled the trigger several times.
One time, she was taken out of the camp and the soldiers told her she would be killed. Her cousin, who was arrested along with her, was “salvaged,” the military’s term for summary execution.
For five months, she was hidden from the public view. No visitors. No lawyers.

“They tied an electric wire to my thumbs. The wire was connected to a military field phone so each time they cranked it, it sent electric shocks. They interrogated me and every time I did not answer, they electrocuted me.” — Trinidad Repuno Herrera 
On April 23, 1977, intelligence officers caught Herrera while she was on her way to Xavierville in Quezon City. “They grabbed me. I kept on shouting, asking for help. Later on I learned that someone recognized me and intelligence agents went around looking for people who knew me,” she said.
Though she had been arrested several times already, Herrera felt that this arrest was to be different. She was brought to the police station along United Nations Avenue in Manila.
“When we arrived (in the police station), there were already nuns looking for me. The police said my friends were very fast in locating me. The nuns spent the night at the police station to look after me,” Herrera said.
The next day, Herrera was brought to Camp Crame in Quezon City. “I was brought to a small room. It was very cold. I was freezing,” she said.
Though Herrera was only in her 30s at that time, she recalled how she was tortured as if it was only yesterday.
“They tied an electric wire to my thumbs. The wire was connected to a military field phone so each time they cranked it, it sent electric shocks. They interrogated me and every time I did not answer, they electrocuted me,” Herrera tearfully recalled.
“My thumb bled,” she said, “but they did not stop. I was already shouting and still they did not stop.”
“When they stopped, I thought it was already over. But they tied the wires to my nipples. I thought I would explode,” she said.
Soldiers tried to force Herrera to sign a blank paper. “I refused. I insisted on seeing my lawyer,” she added.

“Naked, they electrocuted me. Naked, they beat me up. I have chosen to forget the details because it still pains me.” — Romeo Luneta
Tatay Romy said he was arrested by the military on the belief that he was Jose or Pepe, a younger brother, who, according to the military, was then a high-ranking member of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Five other siblings Ernesto, Domingo, Maxima, Franco and Francisco were also activists. Tatay Romy was the first to be arrested.
Francisco, 59, said he was arrested in the early morning of May 12, 1974. That afternoon, Domingo was also arrested at the house of Fidel Agcaoili, another activist who was also arrested. Pepe was arrested in 1975 somewhere in Navotas.
On April 12, 1974, Franco’s wife Margarita and two-year-old daughter Ningning were among the eight individuals who were abducted by state agents in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija. They remain missing to this day.
When asked about the torture, Francisco just said: “All types of [kawalanghiyaan] cruelty.” But Francisco said their brother Ernesto suffered the most.
“Hands tied, he was drowned in a swimming pool. The torturers would revive him and repeat the process over and over again,” Francisco said. “They would also pour hot water on him, followed by cold water that made his body shake involuntarily,” he added. Long after Ernesto was released from prison, Francisco said, his brother’s legs still trembled.
Ernesto was beaten up repeatedly to the point that his legs and arms became bloated, said Francisco.
Ernesto died last year. Domingo died in 2007. Only five of them, including Maxima, Franco and Pepe are still alive.

Lifting his shirt, Dela Fuente pointed at the soft spot just above his stomach and said, “They would hit this with their hands, formed into a ‘cobra’ and I would cringe in pain.” — Danilo Dela Fuente
Dela Fuente, along with seven others, was arrested on Feb. 25, 1982. At around lunchtime that day, while Dela Fuente and other union organizers were having a meeting, elements of the Philippine Constabulary and military intelligence group raided their headquarters. 
Dela Fuente was first brought to Camp Crame where he saw other activists rounded up from different parts of Metro Manila. They were asked to line up outside one of the buildings as military assets identified them. He remembered seeing then Col. Rodolfo Aguinaldo, known for torturing activists. “Nang makita niya si Alan Jazmines, sabi niya, ‘Suki!’ Tuwang-tuwa ang gago. Nangigigil.”
At Camp Crame, Dela Fuente experienced what he called as “cobra.” Lifting his shirt, Dela Fuente pointed at the soft spot just above his stomach and said, “They would hit this with their hands, formed into a ‘cobra’ and I would cringe in pain.”
Days later, his body became numb.
He was later transferred to Fort Bonifacio. Along with three other activists, Dela Fuente was blindfolded with a five-inch masking tape. His captors told him, “Ano? Nakita mo na ang wala?”
Many times, his head was banged on the wall. He was also subjected to electrocution.
The mental torture, he said, was just as bad.
Every night, they would hear the door open. When soldiers hit the door with truncheons, they knew one of them would be taken out. Minutes later, they would hear screams. “Nakikilala namin sa boses kung sino ang kinuha,” he recalled.

“Every night they took 10 men, made them dig their graves, then shot them dead. Every night they also took 10 women to the boat, and raped them.” — Abunawas Kali 
Abunawas Kali was a young government employee in Maguindanao province during Martial Law. His two uncles, Amay Sandalia and Usop Kabalu, had survived the Manili massacre in Carmen, North Cotabato in 1971. The two men lost their respective wives — Pakutao Gani and Maysalam Kabalu, each with three children seven years old and younger — in the carnage by soldiers who shot dead 70 Moros inside a mosque.

The soldiers even wanted the 11-year-old boy to line up with the men, but his mother pleaded to keep him by her side. Then the soldiers shot the men, firing squad-style.
The women and children took the chance to escape, jumped into the river and swam to the other side. It was Kali’s aunts, Saynab and Sawad Rasul, and the latter’s two children, Udin and Bakungan, who lived to tell Kali about what happened. Kali’s niece, Bakungan vividly recalled the soldiers used “a gun with a magazine belt” — an M60 machine gun — to fire at the three men.
The soldiers then looted the Kali family home, carting away the antique Muslim heirloom. Then they burned the house and the rice mill, razing 75 sacks of rice and all of Kali’s important documents and belongings. The soldiers were also seen carrying away Kali’s uncle, Hajitahir Rasul, whose body was never found.
“Grabeng pagmasaker, grabeng ginawa ng militar sa Muslim,” Kali bitterly said, recalling the sad fate of his uncles.
That same year, in September, 20 more of Kali’s relatives were killed in the gruesome “Kulong-kulong massacre” in Palimbang town, Sultan Kudarat province. Some 1,500 Moros were killed when soldiers attacked the coastal town and gathered thousands of residents of seven villages, and detained them in the Tacbil mosque.
“Every night they took 10 men, made them dig their graves, then shot them dead. Every night they also took 10 women to the boat, and raped them,” Kali recalled the story by one of the survivors, his cousin, Bainkung Buwisan. Buwisan was then 14, and was raped, along with other women who were herded into a Philippine Navy boat where they were assaulted and raped. Those who resisted committed suicide by jumping into the ocean, or were shot dead by soldiers.
Kali said his cousin still clearly recalled the name of the Navy boat “Occidental Mindoro” and had the number “99.” Buwisan is now one of the Moro claimants under Republic Act 10638, or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act.
“Even though I was pregnant, I was not exempted from torture.”  — Loida Magpatoc
She was given the water cure. While she lay on her back, water dripped from a jar placed about three feet above her head. After about 15 minutes, she lost consciousness.
Sometimes, her captors played darts, using her face as the dartboard. The worst was the Russian roulette: a soldier placed a single bullet in a revolver, spun the cylinder, placed the muzzle against her head, and pulled the trigger several times.
One time, she was taken out of the camp and the soldiers told her she would be killed. Her cousin, who was arrested along with her, was “salvaged,” the military’s term for summary execution.
For five months, she was hidden from the public view. No visitors. No lawyers.

“They tied an electric wire to my thumbs. The wire was connected to a military field phone so each time they cranked it, it sent electric shocks. They interrogated me and every time I did not answer, they electrocuted me.” — Trinidad Repuno Herrera 
On April 23, 1977, intelligence officers caught Herrera while she was on her way to Xavierville in Quezon City. “They grabbed me. I kept on shouting, asking for help. Later on I learned that someone recognized me and intelligence agents went around looking for people who knew me,” she said.
Though she had been arrested several times already, Herrera felt that this arrest was to be different. She was brought to the police station along United Nations Avenue in Manila.
“When we arrived (in the police station), there were already nuns looking for me. The police said my friends were very fast in locating me. The nuns spent the night at the police station to look after me,” Herrera said.
The next day, Herrera was brought to Camp Crame in Quezon City. “I was brought to a small room. It was very cold. I was freezing,” she said.
Though Herrera was only in her 30s at that time, she recalled how she was tortured as if it was only yesterday.
“They tied an electric wire to my thumbs. The wire was connected to a military field phone so each time they cranked it, it sent electric shocks. They interrogated me and every time I did not answer, they electrocuted me,” Herrera tearfully recalled.
“My thumb bled,” she said, “but they did not stop. I was already shouting and still they did not stop.”
“When they stopped, I thought it was already over. But they tied the wires to my nipples. I thought I would explode,” she said.
Soldiers tried to force Herrera to sign a blank paper. “I refused. I insisted on seeing my lawyer,” she added.

“Naked, they electrocuted me. Naked, they beat me up. I have chosen to forget the details because it still pains me.” — Romeo Luneta
Tatay Romy said he was arrested by the military on the belief that he was Jose or Pepe, a younger brother, who, according to the military, was then a high-ranking member of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Five other siblings Ernesto, Domingo, Maxima, Franco and Francisco were also activists. Tatay Romy was the first to be arrested.
Francisco, 59, said he was arrested in the early morning of May 12, 1974. That afternoon, Domingo was also arrested at the house of Fidel Agcaoili, another activist who was also arrested. Pepe was arrested in 1975 somewhere in Navotas.
On April 12, 1974, Franco’s wife Margarita and two-year-old daughter Ningning were among the eight individuals who were abducted by state agents in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija. They remain missing to this day.
When asked about the torture, Francisco just said: “All types of [kawalanghiyaan] cruelty.” But Francisco said their brother Ernesto suffered the most.
“Hands tied, he was drowned in a swimming pool. The torturers would revive him and repeat the process over and over again,” Francisco said. “They would also pour hot water on him, followed by cold water that made his body shake involuntarily,” he added. Long after Ernesto was released from prison, Francisco said, his brother’s legs still trembled.
Ernesto was beaten up repeatedly to the point that his legs and arms became bloated, said Francisco.
Ernesto died last year. Domingo died in 2007. Only five of them, including Maxima, Franco and Pepe are still alive.

Lifting his shirt, Dela Fuente pointed at the soft spot just above his stomach and said, “They would hit this with their hands, formed into a ‘cobra’ and I would cringe in pain.” — Danilo Dela Fuente
Dela Fuente, along with seven others, was arrested on Feb. 25, 1982. At around lunchtime that day, while Dela Fuente and other union organizers were having a meeting, elements of the Philippine Constabulary and military intelligence group raided their headquarters. 
Dela Fuente was first brought to Camp Crame where he saw other activists rounded up from different parts of Metro Manila. They were asked to line up outside one of the buildings as military assets identified them. He remembered seeing then Col. Rodolfo Aguinaldo, known for torturing activists. “Nang makita niya si Alan Jazmines, sabi niya, ‘Suki!’ Tuwang-tuwa ang gago. Nangigigil.”
At Camp Crame, Dela Fuente experienced what he called as “cobra.” Lifting his shirt, Dela Fuente pointed at the soft spot just above his stomach and said, “They would hit this with their hands, formed into a ‘cobra’ and I would cringe in pain.”
Days later, his body became numb.
He was later transferred to Fort Bonifacio. Along with three other activists, Dela Fuente was blindfolded with a five-inch masking tape. His captors told him, “Ano? Nakita mo na ang wala?”
Many times, his head was banged on the wall. He was also subjected to electrocution.
The mental torture, he said, was just as bad.
Every night, they would hear the door open. When soldiers hit the door with truncheons, they knew one of them would be taken out. Minutes later, they would hear screams. “Nakikilala namin sa boses kung sino ang kinuha,” he recalled.

Abunawas Kali (right) and fellow Moro victim of martial law Kedza Ukas attend a national gathering aiming to frustrate the political ambitions of Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. (Photo by J. Ellao / Bulatlat.com)
“Every night they took 10 men, made them dig their graves, then shot them dead. Every night they also took 10 women to the boat, and raped them.” — Abunawas Kali 
Abunawas Kali was a young government employee in Maguindanao province during Martial Law. His two uncles, Amay Sandalia and Usop Kabalu, had survived the Manili massacre in Carmen, North Cotabato in 1971. The two men lost their respective wives — Pakutao Gani and Maysalam Kabalu, each with three children seven years old and younger — in the carnage by soldiers who shot dead 70 Moros inside a mosque.
Kali asked his two uncles to stay at his house and work in his rice mill in Bulibud village, Sultan Kudarat, along with another uncle, Hajitahir Rasul. Kali was then working in the municipal office in Parang and went home only on weekends. Rasul’s wife, children and sister also lived in Kali’s place.
In 1974, Kali was in Parang when soldiers of the 35th infantry battalion came to the house in Bulibud at dawn and fired randomly. They roused the sleeping residents, and made Kali’s three uncles line up on one side, and the two women and two children on another. The soldiers even wanted the 11-year-old boy to line up with the men, but his mother pleaded to keep him by her side. Then the soldiers shot the men, firing squad-style.
The women and children took the chance to escape, jumped into the river and swam to the other side. It was Kali’s aunts, Saynab and Sawad Rasul, and the latter’s two children, Udin and Bakungan, who lived to tell Kali about what happened. Kali’s niece, Bakungan vividly recalled the soldiers used “a gun with a magazine belt” — an M60 machine gun — to fire at the three men.
The soldiers then looted the Kali family home, carting away the antique Muslim heirloom. Then they burned the house and the rice mill, razing 75 sacks of rice and all of Kali’s important documents and belongings. The soldiers were also seen carrying away Kali’s uncle, Hajitahir Rasul, whose body was never found.
“Grabeng pagmasaker, grabeng ginawa ng militar sa Muslim,” Kali bitterly said, recalling the sad fate of his uncles.
That same year, in September, 20 more of Kali’s relatives were killed in the gruesome “Kulong-kulong massacre” in Palimbang town, Sultan Kudarat province. Some 1,500 Moros were killed when soldiers attacked the coastal town and gathered thousands of residents of seven villages, and detained them in the Tacbil mosque.

As we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law on September 21, 1972, InterAksyon.com posts a series of testimonies from human rights victims of the Marcos regime. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered, tortured, or disappeared in the 14 years the country was under a dictatorship. 
After the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986, close to 10,000 human rights victims – the survivors themselves or their families – filed a class suit against the Marcos estate. A US district court in Hawaii ruled in January 1995 that the victims are entitled to a share of the ill-gotten wealth recovered from the Marcoses: a total of $2.7 billion for their torment and torture.
However, the legal victory remains only on paper. The Hawaii ruling has to be enforced in the Philippines by a local court. The Makati Regional Trial Court is currently hearing the case but the Marcoses have so far been successful in blocking compensation to the plaintiffs.
So far, only $10 million, or $1,000 each, has been awarded to the victims and their kin. The money is not even part of the $2.7-billion compensatory and exemplary damages awarded by the Hawaii court but is from a settlement with Marcos crony, Jose Yao Campos, who has real estate properties in Texas and Colorado.
There was nothing safe about the “safehouse” in Pasig where during the early Martial Law years, then teacher Loretta Ann “Etta” Rosales and her five companions were brought to.
It was in this place where Rosales, who would later head the Commission on Human Rights, was interrogated and tortured for a month by her captors – military agents who turned out to be her students at the Jose Rizal College.
Rosales was electrocuted and sexually abused. Hot candle wax was also poured on her skin and a wet cloth was used to suffocate her.
Despite her anguish, Rosales says she never thought that it would already be her end. “I wasn’t thinking of dying, I was fighting for life.”

A Review
of Martial Law Diary: Part One
By Ex-Navy Capt. Danilo Vizmanos
Published by Popular Bookstore


Danilo
Vizmanos’s Martial Law Diary: Part One is very timely, not only because
it falls on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the declaration of martial law,
but also because today there is an increasing number of people who have not the
slightest idea of what happened during the martial law years. This book should
be made required reading for them. The book not only chronicles events that
transpired from Jan. 1, 1973 to May 19, 1974; it helps the reader to make sense
of these as well. 
By
Alexander Martin Remollino
Bulatlat.com

Three years after the publication of his book Through the Eye of the Storm,
former Navy Capt. Danilo
Vizmanos (known throughout the cause-oriented movement as Ka Dan) is coming out
with another book.  The book, Martial
Law Diary: Part One, will be launched on Sept. 20 at Popular Bookstore in
Quezon City.

While Through the Eye of the Storm narrates Ka Dan’s life from his
birth to his ordeals as a political
prisoner, Martial Law Diary is a record from Jan. 1, 1973 to May 19, 1974
of his thoughts, as well as some of his activities — very few of which are
otherwise told of,  and, if ever,
without detail. This, along with other books on the martial law era, such as
Dolores Stephens-Feria’s Project Sea Hawk: The Barbed Wire Journal,
proves—as Pilosopong Tasyo of Jose Rizal’s Noli Me Tangere said—that
“Not everyone was asleep in the night of our ancestors.” 


Indeed, the martial law era was
a long night, but many who refused to be put to sleep by the lies and terrorism
of the dictatorship. Ka Dan was one of them; he was both actor on the stage of
resistance and chronicler of its history.

Ka Dan’s second book is an easy read. A really fast reader can go through all
236 pages in just about four hours of straight reading, or even less. The author
has the ability to write both elegantly and smoothly.

One who has never heard of Ka Dan prior to reading this book will be very
surprised to find out that the
entries in this diary were written by a man in his forties. For among the
distinguishing characteristics
of the book is that it was written with the burning indignation associated with
the stereotypical young
rebel.

He makes no bones about his admiration for the young rebels of Philippine
history. “The revolution of 1896 was initiated,” he writes, “led and
carried out by young men who were avoided like the plague by their elders.”
And he adds: “With certain exceptions the history of mankind has shown that
moral weakness is a social ailment more closely associated with senility than
with youth and adolescence.”


Salient features
His first entry is a brief
description of martial law and its effects on the Filipino people.

“What are the salient features of what FM proudly proclaims as the ‘New
Society’?” he asks. “Never in the
country’s history has there been so many decent Filipinos in confinement and
behind bars. Politicians, newsmen, teachers, students, civic leaders, writers,
priests, businessmen, and others whose crime was to
reveal the truth and expose the rottenness and stink of this decaying society.

“Never in our history has there been so many fugitives being hunted down by
the PC and AFP intelligence and special units all over the country. They have
become fugitives because they dared express their convictions (a crime under the
New Society!) at the risk of their lives.”

These comments of his on the martial law era are worth keeping in mind.

You can feel Ka Dan’s rage whenever he writes of atrocities against human
rights. For example, in his May 25, 1973 entry, he describes the case of Liliosa
Hilao, the first political prisoner to be killed in detention under martial law,
a brilliant activist-student writer who would, he notes, have graduated cum
laude from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila had she not been arrested by the
martial law regime. (Other accounts, though, say she was a summa cum laude
candidate).  He relates the ghastly
details of her ordeal: “The brave girl patriot was tortured and raped by her
PC captors and guards. Muriatic acid was forced down her throat. She died almost
instantaneously.”

In the diary, he also reveals how PC authorities tried to sweep this violation
under the rug: “To cover up their heinous and sadistic crime, PC authorities
injected drugs into the victim’s body to simulate drug
addiction. When the body was returned to the Hilao family, a PC lieutenant even
gave P460 to the parents for unknown reasons.”


Abominable crime

One wonders whether or not Ka Dan anticipated Imee Marcos’s recent
justification of martial law, when she said: 
“The best roads and bridges were built during martial law. Even the
movies then were very good.”  Although
written in 1973, his condemnation of the abuse and murder of Liliosa Hilao is a
searing reply today to the Marcos daughter, now a congressman from Ilocos:
“For this single crime that Marcos and his gangsters have committed on the
brave but defenseless Liliosa, a million kilometers of paved
roads and all the gimmicks they have come up with cannot erase from the Filipino
people such an
abominable crime that will forever serve as a dark legacy of the New Society.”

In his diary, he also writes frequently of the sufferings and psychological
torture of oppositionist detainees Jose W. Diokno and Ninoy Aquino. 
He lauds Diokno’s solid resolve amid mental pressure and denial of
much-needed medical aid.

In the diary, too, can be found Ka Dan’s lavish praise for leading radical
opponents of the dictatorship, including Jose Ma. Sison, Tony Zumel, Satur
Ocampo, and Pete Daroy.


His diatribes against the then
First Family, not only for their complicity in building a climate of fear but
also for their extreme profligacy, are winners. He compares Ferdinand Marcos to
Caligula, the insane Roman dictator of 37-41 AD, who believed himself a god,
wanted to make his horse a consul, and demanded that a statue of himself be
built in the Jewish temple of Jerusalem. First Lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos, for
her part, is likened to Marie Antoinette, the intolerably ostentatious French
queen of the late 18th century who, when told by ministers that the French
people had nothing to eat, replied: “Let them eat cake!”



Powerful punches


He reserves particularly
powerful punches for those “writers” and “journalists,” such as
Primitivo Mijares and Doroy Valencia, who used their pens to deceive the people
into believing that martial law was the best thing that ever happened to the
country. “It would be an insult to mention the names of Mijares and Valencia
in the same breath as Tony Zumel or Ernie Granada or Satur Ocampo or Roz Galang,”
he writes.

(Mijares himself would later be sickened with his work for the martial law
regime and make an expose of its crimes in his book The Conjugal Dictatorship.
After the book’s publication, he mysteriously disappeared, while his
ten-year-old son was found dead with bruises all over. Primitivo Mijares has not
surfaced to this day.)

Through his diary, Ka Dan also castigates the Marcoses for using entertainment
as an opium to divert the attention of the people from the nauseating ugliness
of the times.

As early as 1973, Ka Dan in his diary predicts the ultimate fall of the Marcoses.
Nay, he does not only predict it; he is also sure of it. In 1986, the Filipino
people would prove him right by ousting the Marcoses through a people-power
uprising at Edsa.

Another characteristic of this book that distinguishes it from other chronicles
of the martial law era is that it describes martial law in the context of U.S.
imperialism. The diary is full of virulent attacks on U.S. imperialism. He
assails the U.S. for preaching “democracy,” “freedom,” and “free
enterprise” while inflicting the most unspeakable violence on peoples who
desire true freedom and democracy, such as the Vietnamese, and backing up the
most anti-democratic regimes such as the Marcos government. He compares the
freedom-loving peoples of the third world, the victims of U.S. hegemonic greed,
to Christ and the early Christians, who during the Roman Empire “were hunted
down and killed like dogs in the Catacombs.”


Roman emperor


Then U.S. President Richard
Nixon is likened by Ka Dan to the Roman emperor Caesar, while his puppets Van
Thieu, Lon Nol, Suharto and Marcos are each depicted as a contemporary Herod who
“betrays his own people.”

At the same time that he condemns U.S. imperialism, Ka Dan in his diary lauds
internationally known symbols and pillars of the anti-imperialist struggle: Mao
Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, Fidel Castro, and Che Guevara. He repeatedly asserts that
military force alone cannot guarantee victory, that the strongest military force
can be defeated by a united and awakened people, and that Vietnam would (as it
did in 1975) eventually triumph over the U.S. In his diary, Ka Dan looked up to
China as a model society. His accurate forecast about Vietnam would come true
while Ka Dan was already in detention, himself a leading victim of martial law.

He makes it clear, though, that while against U.S. imperialism he is not against
the American people.  He writes that
he can differentiate between the U.S. government and corporate establishment, on
one hand, and the American people, on the other. In his May 25, 1973 entry he
tells of having read Mary McCarthy’s Vietnam, and says: “I have not lost
faith in American people so long as there are Mary McCarthys and Daniel
Ellsbergs and Benjamin Spocks and Father Berrigans among them.”

The publication of the first part of Ka Dan’s Martial Law Diary is very
timely, not only because it falls on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the
declaration of martial law, but also because today there is an
increasing number of people who have not the slightest idea of what happened
during the martial law years. This book should be made required reading for
them. The book not only chronicles events that transpired from Jan. 1, 1973 to
May 19, 1974; it helps the reader to make sense of these as well. 


The book is being co-published

MANILA—Activist Satur Ocampo noticed a fellow detainee in agonizing pain while they were urinating outside their prison cell, one of the few privileges allowed by their jail guards during then President Ferdinand Marcos' martial law. 
It turned out, he said, that a barbecue stick was previously stuck in the man’s genitalia as a form of torture during Marcos’ ""brutal"" regime.
Ocampo, now 79, and fellow human rights victims on Thursday retold their own stories of torture and detention to correct what they called ""historical revisionism"" of former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. 
“Can you just imagine the pain and the abominable practice being perpetrated on our people at that time?” he told a forum in Makati City.
Ocampo recalls electric shock torture in the hands of the military during martial law: They started from my forehead, down to my sex organ. pic.twitter.com/2hb68gdDwq

Ocampo was joined by former Senators Aquilino 'Nene' Pimentel Jr. and Rene Saguisag, and Loretta Ann Rosales, seeking to dispute Enrile’s claim that no one was arrested for their political beliefs under Marcos.
“It’s time to come out and be partisan for the truth,” said Rosales, a former human rights chief. 
“Mr. Enrile, unfortunately, does not seem to know when to take the right side of history. He is a person who adjusts according to demands of what is politically expedient for him and what is beneficial for him.”
‘UNOFFICIAL’ TORTURE
Martial law victims and human rights advocates Etta Rosales, Nene Pimentel, Satur Ocampo, and Rene Saguisag come out, reunite at FOCAP forum vs Juan Ponce Enrile’s “historical revisionism” pic.twitter.com/RwxWusaao1

Rosales recalled how she once played dead after a long torture session involving electric shock.
“But they knew when you’re going to die or when you’re still going to survive. So they just kept on,” said the long-time activist, who was also sexually abused by her captors.
It turned out, she said, that these abuses were not sanctioned because the captors stood in attention whenever the “official torturers” came in. 
“Aba’y sabi kong ganun, ‘Dalawa ang levels. May official torture, may unofficial torture,’” she recalled.
BRUTAL
Electrocution was also a form of torture often used on Ocampo, a journalist at that time.
One torturer, he said, was particularly “very brutal”: Rodolfo Aguinaldo.
“He would remove my blindfold (and say,) ‘Look into my eyes! I’m going to give you hell!” said Ocampo, whose head was also occasionally dumped in a toilet bowl.
Pimentel said he was not tortured like Ocampo and Rosales, but was arrested 4 times during martial law. 
“But every time I was released, there was an additional penalty of house arrest and the house arrests were longer—years,” Pimentel said.
Saguisag, who recalled being arrested for describing Marcos as a “super subversive,” said the “psychological stress was beyond words.”
