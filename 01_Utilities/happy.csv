Happiness comes from within when you no longer look within yourself for happiness.  It is the feeling of self satisfaction you get from improving yourself or contributing to others.

Hey guys, I am back with another spotlight! I was a bit late last month, but I've finally caught up! As usual, I have found a few hidden gems that I would love to share with you. The music is separated by platform. Each platform has artists that are unique to it, but it also has some of the same ones. I hope you guys enjoy the music, and thanks for giving these musicians a chance!

This will probably get buried, but at least It‚Äôs here. After years of never having a relationship that lasted longer then like a week I‚Äôve found the one, I‚Äôm going to marry. 6 months ago I re-met a girl from my past. I remember really liking her whenever we hung out, but I never really got to know her that well and it had been years since we had seen or talked to each other.  (Because she lives 6 hours away) When we re-met we instantly hit it off and within a few days of catching up we decided we wanted to date. We took it slow for the first 5 months and stayed in the unofficial staged, until last month we officially started dating. I love her so much, I honestly don‚Äôt deserve her and I thank God for her. It feels so surreal knowing that I finally found the ‚ÄúOne‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been job hunting for the better part of a year now. For the last 5 years, I‚Äôve been the manager at a McDonalds while I went to college. What was supposed to be a 6-month job to help me afford my dream camera, turned into 5 years of stress, anxiety, long days, early mornings, late nights, and irregular schedules. I‚Äôve worked about 50 hours a week for almost two years now- only getting two days off in a row if I specifically requested it. I didn‚Äôt get medical, PTO, or any other benefits besides 30% off meals.

Starting tomorrow, I get 3 weeks PTO, Sat/Sun off, I start at 9am and I‚Äôm off at 5pm, I get medical, and the best part, my pay has increased. By a lot. I‚Äôm having a hard time coping with it, because it just feels too good to be real. When I got the job, I nearly fainted because I thought I did horribly in the interview. For once I‚Äôm so excited about my future. I finally have hope again.",happy,"After Five years working in a fast food kitchen, I finally start a comfortable office job in the morning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lpfmfn/after_five_years_working_in_a_fast_food_kitchen_i/,1613941319.0

So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The minute the guy heard his voice he backed off and left. But not before I knocked out my earbud.  This made me break down in tears. I just wanted to walk my dog.  

I was frantic looking for it as my SO pulled up to pick me up. It was white though and everything was white. After an hour, even when he soon joined me, I could not find my precious gift to myself, that silly wireless earbud.

120,last_goodbye1,1613877482,"So, let me start from the beginning. My dad walked out on me and my mom when I was four, my sister was two. My mom just couldn't balance work and having to take care of us, so we all lived with my grandparents (her parents) until I was six. It was a pretty normal and fun time, though I don't remember much about it. Eventually, my mom got her life together more and had a high enough paying job to get us a townhouse, and that's where I grew up all the way until college. 

But now my aunt and uncle (mom's brother) come into the picture. When I was 10, my cousin that I was excited to meet was unfortunately stillborn. It...it shattered our family. Though it seemed to shatter my aunt the most because she repeatedly tried to take her own life and had to be institutionalized and receive psychiatric care. During that time, my uncle also slowly deteriorated mentally and rarely talked to us anymore. 

But one weekend, about a year later, I took it upon myself to visit him. He was basically half drunk and depressed but was nonetheless surprised to see me, in a good way. I just kind of talked to him about my life and what sports I was doing at the time and boys and all that boring stuff. But it wasn't boring to him. I eventually brought up Sarah (their daughter that was stillborn) and he immediately was getting ready to shut down, but I reassured him that he and my aunt would have been great parents, and he broke started crying a bit. 

But then I started breaking down and crying my eyes out because I didn't want to lose him. He hugged me tight and, apologizing for being the way he was, called me ""baby girl"". I don't know why, but being called that with such genuine love and affection made me cry happy tears. 

Things got better between us after that and he started showing up for more of my games, drove me to school in the winter instead of having to wait for the bus, and we visited my aunt more often (and my mom and sister came too) and she was slowly getting better also, finally leaving at the end of that year and she hasn't attempted to harm herself again. 

My uncle was like the dad I never had in a lot of ways. And me being around made him feel like a proper father but also gave him purpose in life again. He's told me before he was extremely close to ending it because he just didn't know what to do with himself anymore. I love him so much",happy,My uncle turns 55 today.

I (23f) have been dating my SO (23m) for over a year now and it's been the best year of my life. I've never felt this happy or this comfortable or felt like I actually mattered in a relationship before and I'm still not used to it. Even though I'm not used to it I love the feeling of being on cloud nine and having my heart flutter everytime he message me or compliments or tells me how lucky he is to have someone who cares about him as much as he cares for me. I'm unconditionally in love with him and I want to show him how much he means to me every day and spend the rest of my life with him. 

I've never felt this appreciate it that I actually matter to someone before and it feels good he is the one person I want to tell everything to and is honestly my best friend! I can be my weird dorky self around him and he finds it cute, he makes me laugh and smile until it hurts (in a good way) I constantly think of him and have dreams of him when I fall asleep each night! I imagine what it would be like to move in with him and to get married to him and what our kids would look like, which is totally out of character for me because before I met him I never wanted to get married or have kids of my own! 

I definitely feel like it was destiny that we met as cliche as that sounds but honestly at this point I dont mind he is my soulmate and I believe we were ment to find eachother and spend an eternity with eachother.

I'm just so in love that I ache to be with him and I miss him every second of every day that we can't see eachother in person due to what's going on in the world at this moment.

...and it all comes down to a kid. a single kid kid out of 7 billion humans gets to name it to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. It's pretty touching and pretty selfless of all those people to let a kid name their creation that they spent years building up and supporting and worked on.

We used to listen to the music of a very popular artist together and be huge fans. This artists music has made my life much more bearable as their music has helped me not go down a dark abyss, because it's a reminder of my brother --it's a very strong connection. 

A friend of mine has the capability of making it so I can meet this artist and have a conversation with them, to be able to thank them for making life happier and easier for me. The fact that I am going to be meeting this person once covid is over, cures years worth of pain, even when I haven't even met them yet.

He makes me cry tears of joy, makes me laugh, always plays with me, and is always supportive of everything I do. He's intelligent, kind, funny, handsome, caring, and the perfect man for me. I can't believe he chose me out of 3.4 billion people. I've never wanted to cherish someone, love for someone so much. To be frank, before meeting him I've told myself I wouldn't date until I was 30. I wasn't looking for love. I never really understood love. But his perfection opened my eyes. He's my sunshine, my ray of happiness, always bringing me joy even during tough times. I hope I can be the same for him. Seeing him smile is the greatest gift of all.

I love you, my handsome prince. üòä

I've always thought of myself as a happy guy (15) but recently I've been getting mood shifts in being happy with friends to the point of screaming with them in discord to just straight up tearing up for no reason. Doesn't help at all that i also got to lose my left nut from torsion so that kinda sucked but i wasn't as devastated as my parents when this happened. Im kinda confused with myself as i get sad and happy about the little things but the bigger things i seem to ignore or just not affect me as much. Is there like a way or tips on how to just control emotions way easier or something? Friends have just said the usual things like do different hobbies and hang out more but in the end, my days currently end with me just sobbing up a bit before bed then tomorrow happens to me like nothing happened. Others say im depressed but i don't think i am since im not really too sad or atleast im sure that its worse than what i have.

My name is Maks and I work a 9-5 job as admin assistant but sometimes edit videos and do artsy stuff. This video is for a song made by my friend and artist Alexandra Sawyer-Hudson aka Mee and The Band.

We are close friends and I worked with and for her a few times before. This is the latest product of our relationship , the music video - edited by me! I received a small payment for this but all views money goes to her and everyone else who looks after her.   


Editing this took me out of a dark place during the lockdown, I must say it was hard, getting up and trying to stay consistent and focus... There was a point where I lost my files, had to redo things and it was all just crumbling down, I felt bad because I got paid half in advance and I am failing to deliver... I somehow managed to find the power within me to finish it, that's why it makes me happy - because I found empowerment in what I can do. Some poeple will like this, some people won't , all I want to share is some love.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you &lt;3

364,focsu,1613248429,"Life has a way of making us lose sight of what matters. It has become so normal for me to see people drifting far from what they love just so they can stay afloat. Sometimes it can be beautiful, most of the times it is painful. Sometimes it involves growth, often times hardships.

Here I was, downloading SoundCloud after four years to find some background study music, when I noticed something that made me all fuzzy inside. I cried. Couldn't stop myself. My dear cousin that immigrated to study abroad and whom I know has been working himself to the bone never quit his love. He never stopped making music. He doesn't do it for money, he doesn't do it just as a hobby. He truly loves it and is keeping true to himself. Love you cuz, thank you for showing me your beauty.",happy,My cousin loves what he does and it made me feel all warm inside,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lj8lyl/my_cousin_loves_what_he_does_and_it_made_me_feel/,1613219629.0
