Well, as I'm turning onto my neighborhood's main street from a cross street after dropping off a friend after school, I see a little boy and his mother. They're a ways away, but I still make room for them. The elementary school in this area just got out, so I'm not too bothered, even if highschool had me exhausted. Then, I see this kid do that thing that all the toddlers do in those little cars where they yeet the steering wheel back and forth so they do a zig zag. Well, I decide to have a bit of fun, and I wiggle my car too, enough to visibly shake it side-to-side, but not enough to be that dangerous (I checked the area anyway, they were the only pedestrians, and I was the only *actual* car) And this little dude, oh my lord, he got the brightest little smile on his tiny little face, and he kept wiggling his little car.

327,its_a_me__a_person,1614096491,"So I (well, my mom and I...) was (were) petsitting my neighbor's really old, blind, and deaf dog for 4 days last weekend. His name was Archie. He was the type of dog that is on the Ceasar's dog food commercial. I would carry him down the stairs so he wouldn't have to exert his energy, I would stay in the house to made sure he ate his food and got plenty of water, I would stay even after to see if he would settle down on one of his beds, and then I'd gently walk over and pet him. I would pet him on the side of his hind legs towards his back end and he would kick his leg out like my dog does when she likes that. I would also scratch his chin and he would tilt his head into my hand and seem like he was enjoying a nice chin rub.

He was such a good boy for me. So gentle, so quiet, hardly a problem.

So anyways, my neighbors obviously came back and such. So I was walking out the door this morning to go to school and I see my neighbor out with Archie. My neighbor and my mom were talking about him and what a good dog he is. He's turned around doing his business in the bushes. I'm just standing there, not saying anything, and then Archie turns around and \*runs\* towards me wagging his short stubby tail. Like he is excited to see me! I was only petsitting him for like 4 days and anyways, isn't he blind!? And my mom who was also petsitting him was standing like two feet away from me. He looks over at her and then walks back to my neighbor.

This may not seem that important to you but that was just the boost I needed to start my day &lt;3

TL;DR - M mom and I were petsitting my neighbor's blind old dog. As I was walking out the door this morning my mom and my neighbor were talking and the dog came running up to me wagging his tail and didn't even bother saying hi to my mom.",MadeMeSmile,My day started out good &lt;3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/lqlxj1/my_day_started_out_good_3/,1614067691.0

692,realSpaceJuiceYT,1614002856,"Before we begin I just want to let you know that this in no way endorsing terrorism.


Hello my name is Emir and this is my story. So as long as I can remember, we were in minnesota and I went to school at Gatewood Elementary School.¬† In that school I learned a lot of things. I was in 1st grade back then. Everytime you would cross the corners and hallways of the school you would see a ton of flags, to be specific country flags. I would see every country except one. And it was my country, Turkey. So one day when I was in 2nd grade (first day of school) and I asked the principal if you guys could somehow add Turkey in the hallways. He responded saying ‚Äú*laughter* oh we are super sorry we didn‚Äôt notice that, it should be ready in two week. I was super happy to see my own country flag in this school. Then I got the news from my parents that we were moving, moving to georgia.


I was super sad leaving all of my friends and memories here. Everytime someone from the class left or moved they would put all of the pictures of the students on one piece of paper, and the student would write something next to their picture. It‚Äôs still funny. I still have it, not a scratch on it. Well, before the day we moved the school principal showed me the flag and hung it right above my classroom door. I was super happy but sadly that happiness had to end in my new school in savannah georgia.¬†


I went to visit my school after a week to get me signed up for second grade. After we signed up I saw that this school had a ton of black students (saying their skin color not in a racist way but you will understand later in the story). They seemed super nice to each other. I made quick friends there, I was super happy. After a week that happiness shattered. People saw the mole on my chin and guess what they did. Call me names, bully me, harass me. One day I was on the school bus. The bus driver told this fourth grader to sit down because he was up in his seat walking around. And he did not listen, but back then my brain automatically thought that he didn‚Äôt hear her. So I said ‚ÄúThe bus driver told you to sit down.‚Äù and as soon as he heard me he said ‚Äúwhat did you say to me?‚Äù and grabbed his comb that black people use to comb their hair (again not in a racist way I am just describing) and got that in his hand and hit my stomach with that comb.¬†


After that day I told the principal what happened and they said they will check the cameras to see what happened. After they called the kid down to the front office all that happened was he apologized. That‚Äôs all nothing else, he did not get detention, neither suspension he just apologized. After we left the office I went to my third grade teacher and started to get ready for class. Then that kid that punched me with his comb told my teacher that I said to him ‚Äúyou hit me in the stomach so I told the teacher on you hahahah‚Äù when I clearly didn‚Äôt.¬†


After a few months we got a new student. As nice as I was to him I told him everything about the school, the teachers, etc. After a few weeks they found out that I was a muslim they planned on something. When I went to the bathroom the new kid came in and he started punching me in the bathroom saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you get for not believing in Jesus Christ.‚Äù See this is the part where I was saying ‚Äúthere were a lot of black students.‚Äù Black people are against racism and understand it, and I was wondering if that was even true anymore. After that happened I hated this school. I kept patient for about a year.¬†


Then I made it into fourth grade all of those kids that bullied me were now lonely and nobody wanted to hang out with them. Fourth grade for me was probably the best experience in West Chatham Elementary I had. I started gaining friends, quickly, and fastly. I was super happy that I thought this wouldn‚Äôt end. But sadly it had too. We were moving since the company my dad used to work for shut business down. We had to move. The new school I moved to was probably one of my favorites (I am not going to name it because I still live around that zone.) I was in 5th grade, then went to middle school, 6th grade, 7th grade is the current grade I am in as of writing this.


¬†I wrote this story to let you guys know that, just because someone chooses a religion doesn‚Äôt mean that they are the person you think they are. I have been called a terrorist before when I clearly didn‚Äôt harm anyone in my school. Just because someone has 1% difference in D.N.A doesn‚Äôt mean they are ugly, weird. If you call someone a terrorist because of their religion I hope you know that if a white american blew up a building they would call him a bomber not a terrorist. The rule in Islam is that you never hurt or kill anyone unless its for protection.¬† ISIS is the opposite believe it or not the creator of ISIS is hired by a american president (I am not going to name for reasons) and it is sad to see humanity being so lost. Deep down I know you guys have stories too, share them, make a difference.",MadeMeSmile,"The story of the ""terrorist"" called ""moleface""",https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/lpot5s/the_story_of_the_terrorist_called_moleface/,1613974056.0

934,ChickNamedVenus,1613931453,"Not sure if this counts here, but I've been happy crying sporadically for the last day, so yes.

I've always wanted kids, but I have never wanted to get pregnant for many reasons. The main reasons are the women in my family often have many miscarriages before they successfully have a child (I would not be able to cope with that) and I have some mental health issues (autism, PTSD, bipolar I disorder) that can be inherited. They can have those mental health issues without me being their biological mother, but with me as the biological mother, it's more likely. My fianc√© (AFAB enby) has been apprehensive to the idea of pregnancy, but doesn't care whether or not they have kids. If they had them, they would love them with all of their heart, but if they didn't have them, it wouldn't feel like they lost a piece of their life. They just don't find the experience appealing. Because of this, we knew that kids was probably off the table because we preferred having children come out of one of us. 

I was very surprised when yesterday, they came up to me and said (word-for-word; yes, I memorized what they said); ""I don't really want to get pregnant, but I love you, and I know having and raising kids is everything to you. I want to raise kids with you, too, because having little me and yous running around sounds pretty awesome. But, what I'm saying is I'll get pregnant, if that's what you want.""

I love them so much and I'm so happy to start a family with them. We're going to get one of the males in my family (hopefully a cousin that is about my age because we look and act very similar and are both mixed race) to donate their sperm because the majority of them are willing and happy for us. We hope they can get pregnant within the next year or so, after we sort everything out! Sorry for long post, but I am so happy.",MadeMeSmile,My fianc√© agreed to get pregnant and have our kid!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/lp302z/my_fianc√©_agreed_to_get_pregnant_and_have_our_kid/,1613902653.0

I was in the navy a long time ago.. before satellite internet or cell phones that could work out in the middle of the ocean.  

At this time, I was in charge of the communications on the ship I was stationed on.  One day I found an old MARS relay book cleaning out some shelves and It had all the frequencies for amateur radios (we had to be careful to stay on the right frequencies with our radios).

A shipmate and I found we could hear some of the radio operators talking to each other and we started talking with them.  Once they found out we were a navy ship, they offered to make calls home for us.  Back then they had analog switches to patch radio to phones and so the operator had to listen to the call and flip the switch when someone said ‚Äúover‚Äù.

My newly married wife and I had romantic conversations like:

‚ÄúI love you... over.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait to see you... over.‚Äù

I watched my ultimate comfort film, Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service. Right up until the last credit I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and a renewed sense of life and hope. Call me dramatic but it‚Äôs true. Anyway this feeling has persisted and when I checked Facebook afterwards I did not hesitate to help a fellow ACNH player out, something that at this time of night I wouldn‚Äôt normally do. My point is that the simple act of watching a beautiful and uplifting film can remedy a weeks worth of stress and encourages kindness however small.

My power has been back on for over 12 hours now after being out for three days straight and my pipes are all working. I am so thankful to be doing well after all this. We've had an ongoing work group chat and I mentioned I was doing well but out of gas, I had driven back and forth to help a friend a couple times and had 30 miles left in my tank, and I wasted all of them going to 12 different gas stations which all had no fuel. (In hindsight, I probably should have called first). When I parked back in my driveway I had 4 miles of gas left and would just have to stay put until the gas station outside my neighborhood got more, which wouldn't have been a big deal anyways, especially since all the roads are icy.

Anyways, my boss texted me and said he would bring me gas in the morning, and that he had also been without any power or heat for three days just like all the rest of us. I assured him it wasn't a big deal, I wasn't going anywhere, and I had plenty of food and necessities. Sure enough he called me at 9 am sharp this morning that he was on his way, he drove around until he found gas and then got us both some, came to my house, filled up my gas tank and then left. 

I don't want to call him out on facebook or anything because he's a more shy man and he didn't do this for the publicity, but I definitely wanted to tell someone about it. I can't believe how kind he was to do me such a big favor. And yes, his power came on at the same time as mine, and I had an omaha steaks package shipped to him as a thank you.",MadeMeSmile,My boss drove to my house to put gas in my car,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/ln4jb0/my_boss_drove_to_my_house_to_put_gas_in_my_car/,1613673636.0

When I was around 7 years old I met this girl and we instantly bonded. We did everything together. We practically were the same person. Movies, parks, zoo's, you name it we did it together. I moved away when I was 11 which really destroyed me. I can safely say that I have never had a closer friend. As an 11 year old we weren't mature enough to really appreciate the friendship and we went many years not talking. It was hard at first being lonely, but I just tried to push all of the memories away (defo not recommend). I found out today we're moving back because of a new job opportunity! I was so excited when I found this out because I long to see my friend again. I was nervous to reach out after not talking in 7 years. I got myself mentally ready and texted her. To my surprise she missed me too! I really couldn't believe it.. it just made me feel something that I haven't in a while.

1937,Scipio555,1613673329,"&gt; An Arab-Israeli nurse, **Maher Ibrahim** , comforted an Orthodox Jew dying of Covid by reciting for him the Shema Israel, the most heartfelt Jewish prayer. It happened in the **HaEmek hospital in Afula, in Galilee, Israel.** ‚ÄúWe saw that the patient's condition was rapidly deteriorating. For this we have warned the relatives that time was now pressing ¬ª. **Shlomo Galster's** family, however, were in Netanya, relatively far from Afula. ¬´Shlomo and I had made friends - continued the nurse -. **For cultural interest I have studied Judaism a little** and I know that when the soul leaves the body, the words Shema Israel must be pronounced ¬ª. And that's what Ibrahim did: ¬´I don't know all the prayer - he explained - but I said those words. And so I told Shlomo's daughter when she arrived: **those were the last words her father heard** . I have been working in the hospital for 20 years, I think **the most important thing is to stay human.** **We are all children of one God ¬ª** . Shlomo's relatives arrived 45 minutes after his death: ¬´They made us wear sterilized clothing to be able to say goodbye. Everything - said Shlomo's daughter, **Merav**\- was done with great tact. Then that angel came to us ¬ª, he added referring to Ibrahim and his prayer. ‚ÄúHe told us he was sorry for not being able to do more. We knew that the medical team had done their utmost in very difficult conditions. **It is** **from episodes like these that peace begins ¬ª** , concluded Merav.  
&gt;  
&gt;The gesture of the Arab-Israeli nurse moved public opinion. Premier **Benjamin Netanyahu** expressed the thanks of everyone and his admiration to the nurse.

I made a post on a local social media net, and a man offered to come shovel for us.  I had also promised hot chocolate in the post, so brought him a mug of it halfway through his work.  He laughed, but really seemed to appreciate it.

When he finished, I paid him, we chatted for a minute, then he handed me a folded wad of cash, saying, 'Once you can do it, take your spouse out for something nice, it's on me.""  He had returned every dollar we paid him.

Later he texted me his son's number, who usually does the shoveling, and said he'd help us any time we need in the future.

I hadn‚Äôt thought about that until today because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve lost 100 pounds, and I‚Äôm still quite overweight. And I don‚Äôt enjoy being the centre of attention. 

Today I was walking past the kebab shop near my apartment. I‚Äôve eaten there a couple dozen times over the years and I always have a long chat with the friendly old Jordanian guy and his wife who own it. But I haven‚Äôt been in the shop for a few months because I‚Äôve been dieting hard.

I glanced in the window and saw a fresh tray of baklava and decided after another good weigh this arvo i had earned a treat. 

I walk in and straight away the nice old guy shouts ‚Äòmy goodness! What has happened! You have lost so much weight my friend!‚Äô Then his wife bursts out of the kitchen like an Arabic grandma Kramer and starts pinching my arm and laughing and wailing ‚ÄòooOOoo so thin, make him a kebab quick before he disappears!‚Äô Im sure I was blushing, especially because there were a couple construction workers in the shop too waiting for food, looking amused at the scene. 

It did make me smile afterward though when I was walking away, happy and I guess encouraged something is happening.

2119,RedHeadRage63,1613614750,"I‚Äôve worked my entire life, since the age of 11, when I had my first job sweeping up hair and taking out the trash at a hair salon for $1 an hour. I‚Äôve only ever not worked during a few months of my pregnancy when I was on complete bed rest due to some serious complications. 

On June 25th of last year I lost my job as an insurance agent. I was damn good at my job and my clients really liked working with me. Unfortunately, due to an incident that happened in April of 2019, I was arrested and charged with 2 felonies. I was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong people. Sadly, because of the way the law is interpreted where I live, due to where certain illegal items were found in relation to where I was sitting (under the seat I was sitting in), I was considered to be in the ‚Äúcare, custody and control‚Äù of them and was subsequently charged. I was actually very lucky because I could have been charged with much higher felonies and wasn‚Äôt. Mostly because the arresting officer actually knew me and my background. 

The person these items actually belonged to didn‚Äôt admit to it, and since I‚Äôd never been in any kind of trouble before (I was 55 years old at the time it happened), he knew, or assumed, I‚Äôd just get a slap on the wrist as opposed to him going back to prison for several years, he never copped to it and off to a night in jail I went. 

Fast forward to later that year when I took the test to be able to apply for my license to sell life insurance. I aced the test, and upon filling out the paperwork required to apply for the license, I was required to disclose any sort of criminal history. In the eyes of the State, even though I wasn‚Äôt convicted of those felonies and adjudication was withheld and probation served, the incident was still as good as a conviction. 

As a result, the State chose to revoke all of my standing insurance licenses, effectively taking away my livelihood. And even though I showed proof that my mitigating factors were greater than their aggravating factors, they still chose revocation over suspension. So as of June 25 of last year I was no longer allowed to work in the insurance industry in any capacity. 

I‚Äôve spent the last eight months struggling to pay my bills and keep a roof over our heads. Unemployment only pays so much. My biggest hurdle has been having a felony on my record even though there was no conviction. When a prospective employer runs a background check, all they see is what‚Äôs on paper, not the actual person in question. I‚Äôve been turned down for just about every job I can think of and so many that I‚Äôve lost count of, but giving up has never been an option. I have a household to run and four cats to care for so there was never a choice about quitting.

Last week I was contacted by a company that I had applied to that is considered to be a ‚Äúfair chance‚Äú employer. That is, that they tend to be a little less judgmental when doing background checks. They were actually interested in interviewing me, and although the commute is a bit long, I decided to go. 

I can‚Äôt remember the exact words that were used, but the gentleman that was interviewing me made a comment about people in my position just needing someone to give them a chance‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever asked- just give me a chance to prove that the blemishes on my record don‚Äôt make me less of a person or less able to do a job. I immediately teared up and told him that he‚Äôs the first person to have ever said that to me in this entire eight month journey to get back into the workforce. We talked a little more about my skills and experience and why I thought I would be a good fit for the position and I told him that I really, really wanted the job and looked forward to hearing from him soon. He said that he had some more interviews to do and it would probably be a couple of weeks before they made their decision.

I left feeling pretty damn good about how well I did in the interview. I just got really positive vibes from the whole office. I had a couple of other interviews lined up with other employers and continued filling out applications and sending out my r√©sum√©. I mean, what else was I going to do?

Yesterday, I received a call from the gentleman I had spoken to at that interview, but I missed his call and he left a voicemail requesting that I call him back. In my mind this was how it always ended. I would interview and think that I did an amazing job at it and then I would get a phone call or an email saying that they had gone with someone else. Not this time. Not this time. He was calling to offer me the position and told me that after they had spoken with me they still interviewed a couple more prospects but had gotten such a good feeling from my interview that they didn‚Äôt even call anymore applicants. 

So yes... this chick right here... soon to be 58 years old this year, is starting a new career, with a new company, in a new place, with all new people. And it only took 8 months of unwavering perseverance, hours and hours of writing and re-writing my r√©sum√© and sending it out to companies for all kinds of positions- even ones I had no experience at- getting email after email saying ‚ÄúThanks but no thanks, you have a great r√©sum√© but you‚Äôre not what we‚Äôre looking for, blah, blah, blah. You‚Äôre over educated or under experienced or just plain no.‚Äù.

I know this is a long story without a really Big Bang at the end but I really want others facing the same, or similar, issues to know that it CAN be done. It can. Whether you‚Äôre my age or younger, with or without a criminal background, it can happen for you too. Even when it seems like all you hear is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, you have to keep going until you finally get that ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. 

I haven‚Äôt stopped smiling since yesterday. I start my new career on Monday and even though I‚Äôll have to get up at the ungodly hour of 5am and drive 45 minutes to get there, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Someone finally saw the person I am behind the ‚Äúcriminal history‚Äù and decided to take a chance on me, and for that, I am eternally grateful. Just remember- Never look back. That‚Äôs not the direction you‚Äôre going. ‚ù§Ô∏è",MadeMeSmile,First genuine smile in almost 8 months!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/lmba68/first_genuine_smile_in_almost_8_months/,1613585950.0

There's a pond in the community public space behind my house, but the only sledding hill leads right to it. So when my kids go down the hill, they have to stop themselves at the bottom. 

On one unfortunate run, the kids tumbled out onto the snow, but the sled kept going and slid out onto the frozen pond. 

My wife, in abundant caution, told them to leave it there and that I'd retrieve it. But while I was getting dressed to head out, a teenaged kid in the neighborhood snagged it and put it in a safe place. I don't know who he was, and my kids didn't know him either.

Being a teenager and this being reddit, maybe he'll see this post. If so, thank you. What an incredibly considerate thing to do for a stranger.

2593,kouignie,1613381159,"My FIL was the tyoe who made friends everywhere. Strangers on the street, he‚Äôd wave to. A service worker who‚Äôd look a little grumpy, he‚Äôd tell a dad joke to. Years back, he always made chit chat with his neighbor A. At some point, he started regularly bringing in A‚Äôs trash/ recycling on garbage day, and walk his newspaper to the door. 

My loving FIL passed 4y ago to pancreatic cancer. 

At some point last year, I was confused that my husband stopped going to her house for trash day (to bring out her trash bins). He told me he didn‚Äôt need to anymore, that A just started doing it for her without her asking. 

We dropped by this past weekend, to bring MIL some goodies for Chinese New Year. We were confused at a gorgeous bouquet on her doorstep... did my SIL come by earlier as a surprise..?

Turns out, my MIL gave A a small gift for his new grandson a few months back. He wanted to do a small gesture, and remembered her on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Which is so sweet- I can see a neighbor doing that out of kindness, for a widow who probably won‚Äôt get a Vday gift or probably misses her husband doing that. (LOL my FIL was so stingy and dint believe in dying flowers!!) 

Neighbor and wife also save veggies from their garden for her, without asking. We do live close to her and stop by. And with quarantine I do worry about her living alone and feeling lonely. But it‚Äôs nice to feel like there‚Äôs a community that still helps her too; especially after someone passes, people forget and stop ‚Äúcoming by‚Äù (proverbially now).",MadeMeSmile,Neighbor Looks After Widowed MIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/lka3za/neighbor_looks_after_widowed_mil/,1613352359.0

I was delivery driving tonight and after I had picked up an Indian order I went to start my car back up and it was freakin DEAD. I tried calling my roommate (phone off, romantic Valentine‚Äôs bath, fuck em), AAA (too busy for prompt service), before eventually settling on ordering an Uber and hunkering down while I waited. 

I was chillin in my car and the lady came out to do a curbside pickup, saw me still hanging around, and I told her what was up. She goes, ‚Äúcome in it‚Äôs too cold‚Äù, while she‚Äôs in sweats and slippers, and THEN asks me what I want: tikka masala or chicken korma. I tried to let her off the hook by letting her know I‚Äôm vegetarian (and had a ride coming) and she replies with ‚Äúwhat do you want vegetarian‚Äù. We settled on a garlic naan and I follow her inside. She SITS ME DOWN in a comfy spot and a few minutes later brings me a bag complete with 2 naans (which I promptly began munching on), a full-sized to-go container of something yummy smelling, and full of veggies, and a can of coke. 

I thanked her profusely since I really couldn‚Äôt do anything else as she walked away and started tidying up for the night. Her two young girls had been running around playing the whole time, she looks at them and says to me, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be you someday.

&amp;#x200B;

It's time for a poem, and I'm up for the task.

But give me a second, while I put on my mask.

Since I was in school, this is the most I've been tested,

But I do what I must so I don't get arrested.

&amp;#x200B;

It's tough being apart, yet at the same time,

Too much together can cross a fine line.

They say separation makes the heart grow fonder,

But the saying gives pause, and leaves me to ponder.

&amp;#x200B;

How could they know that the distance begat,

The feelings of love that they felt as they sat?

Would it hold true today, or would it fall flat?

Would the same feelings build if they could video chat?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't say for sure, but at a personal level,

A yearning does grow the longer I travel.

I'll be flying home soon, it won't be much longer.

With each day that passes, the desire grows stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I arrive, there are more hoops to jump through.

But I'd jump through a thousand to get back to you!

&amp;#x200B;

Love,

iSmokeTheXS",MadeMeSmile,"I wrote a Covid-themed poem for my wife (Tried so hard to find another place to post this, sorry)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/ljot5s/i_wrote_a_covidthemed_poem_for_my_wife_tried_so/,1613282189.0

Last summer My mother died suddenly at 62 on my birthday.  The fog of grief is hard to shake, but I had a beautifully bittersweet mystery I solved recently that taught me a lesson.

My mom owned a flower shop my whole life and as a kid I helped, and on Valentines Day every year we would make a stop out in the middle of a back country road, and leave roses in a field. Growing up, you don‚Äôt have the sense to ask questions why.

Right after she died, I was scrolling thru Social media and caught a post from a stranger mentioning my mom and it completely took me off guard. ""I lost a wonderful friend last week, a beautiful woman named \*\*\*\* and she was the woman that stayed with mom and dad Valentines of 1985 that night until help arrived""

&amp;#x200B;

It dawned on me I never asked questions, and now I was going thru the painful experience of learning I didn‚Äôt have a mother- I wanted to know what was so special to my mom about that field and this stranger.

I went into newspaper archives, and pulled local newspapers from the Week of Valentines of 1985  Immediately, I saw on the front page the news article. See below redacted article

[https://imgur.com/a/U2uKOQ6](https://imgur.com/a/U2uKOQ6)

My mother had come down the dark back country road to deliver her last Valentines roses for the night, and drove across the bend and her headlights shined right on a man as he pulled out a shot gun and shot his wife in the face on the side of the road in the corn field, and then he shot himself. She pulled over-  Mom sat in the dark field for an hour waiting for a passerby , next to the woman as she died. She didn't want to leave her in her last moments, as she was still clawing at the ground as if trying to get away. Eventually the police and coronor arrived. 

When I finished reading the article and saw the last line listing the name of coroner; I immediately called my best friend and asked her if she knew him-- because the unusual last name was her maiden name. It was her uncle. He was still alive, and kindly spoke to me about that day. Due to the graphic nature of the murder, he remembered that day in 1985 crystal clear detail. He especially remembered the kind woman who sat with the bodies, driving her home late that night because she was so shook up. Here my adult best friend and I had a childhood connection and didnt know.

Last night I drove to the spot in the field in the dark  and I was terrified. I felt healed suddenly of my grief because I realized how strong my mom was to be out there alone with the bodies, and carried the experience with her selflessly for 35 years. 

I have now befriended the family descendants. I promised to the family to continue the tradition every Valentines day, leaving roses at the field, and reminding myself of that beautiful strength",MadeMeSmile,Bittersweet Valentine,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/ljklam/bittersweet_valentine/,1613261924.0

3041,Maimaexx,1613285176,"He's been there before, started right from square one, he's been the age of 20, real life had only just started, he knew nobody was perfect and still knows it now. He's failed, stood up and tried again, he's lost, he's been heartbroken and he stood back up again. He had days where he didn't feel like going to the meeting or driving miles for work, he had days where he'd boom out of bed and go smash it üòä. But no matter what day, right from day one, I've watched him, I've watched how he loved, I've watched how he's lived and listened to his words, and that man has shaped me to be the person I am today. When he wasn't holding my hand, he was holding my back, when I was afraid he'd hug me and tell me that it'll all be ok, he still does, he's the laughter, he's the joy, he's the one who makes me smile, and laugh till my stomach hurts, that's my dad, he's taught me so much, guiding me along the way. I'm reaching 20 now and one thing I would like to say, is your little girl is so proud of you, she's proud of all your achievements, she's proud of all your downs when you stood back up, she's proud of all your wow moments, but the one main thing she's proud of, is to call you her dad. You've lived, you've been through a lot, and along the way you've taught me so much, but you've shown me, you've let me watch you do it, you've believed in me, you still do, everyday. Dad, you are incredible, in every way. And I hope I can live my life the same way, because you've taught me so much. Most importantly, you've shown me love, and a dads love is like no other. 

Thank you for teaching me the ways of the world, thank you for teaching me that nobody is perfect but being yourself is, thank you for teaching me that anything is possible.

3228,martyj310,1613240716,"This story is about ten years old now, but I recently thought about it and what better time to share than now?

I had just turned 19 and had been drinking with two other friends. That night we were caught by police and the sobriety tests began. I blew over the legal limit and was issued a MIC (Minor in Consumption) but got to go home.

A few weeks later I had my court date. I was nervous to go but my dad had offered to go with me to help calm my nerves. I walked into the courtroom and lo-and-behold my boss at the time was sitting in one of the seats. His eyes got real big when he saw me and he said, ‚ÄúWow. I really didn‚Äôt expect to see you here.‚Äù

I had worked at Quiznos at the time and my boss was, for lack of a better term, out there. He had a bad drinking problem and always came across like he was doing something sketchy. He once fought another employee in the back room while I was making sandwiches for customers but that‚Äôs another story.

Anyways back in the court room I tell my dad that that‚Äôs my boss and he says, ‚ÄúNo fucking way,‚Äù and starts laughing. 

I get called up to the podium and the judge sentences me a $300 fine and I head over to the courtroom clerk to sign some paperwork. 

My boss gets called up to the podium next. Before the judge has time to speak my boss yells, ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT GUILTY!‚Äù at the
top of his lungs. The judge looks at him angrily and tells him not to speak out of turn again. Not even ten seconds later he interrupts the judge mid sentence yelling at the top of his lungs that he is innocent. 

The judge takes off his glasses, peers at him and asks, ‚ÄúSir, have you been drinking?‚Äù Just then my eyes nearly popped out of my head. My boss starts wavering back and forth and it‚Äôs obvious now. He‚Äôs wasted. Two officers walk him out of the courtroom while he‚Äôs yelling words that I can‚Äôt make out. 

 I finish my paperwork and head over to my dad. We‚Äôre done with everything now so we walk out of the courtroom. As we get to the next room my boss is pinned on the ground, hands behind his back screaming ‚ÄúPIGS‚Äù at the top of his lungs. 

My dad and I refrain from laughter as we walk out of the building. When we finally are out of earshot we burst into uncontrollable, crying laughter. I didn‚Äôt even care about my $300 fine anymore.

Later that day I went to work. When my boss didn‚Äôt show up about an hour after the start of his shift, another employee started to show concern. I looked at them, started to laugh and said, ‚ÄúYeah. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs coming in today.‚Äù

TL;DR 

I got a MIC when I was 19 and had to go to court. My off-kilter boss happened to also be at court that day and got arrested for being drunk in the courtroom.",MadeMeSmile,My boss and I had the same court-date,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/lj60r7/my_boss_and_i_had_the_same_courtdate/,1613211916.0
