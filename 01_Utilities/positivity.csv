I have a bad habit of comparing my looks to other people, especially friends and family members. It’s really self detrimental bc it makes me feel so bad about how I look. They’re so beautiful and they don’t even try, but I’m just below average even when I try my best to look good. 

My own family and a couple in-laws have commented on how it looks like a gained weight or my skin worsened. I’m in my 20s and I thought I’d be past the point of caring so much about how I look. 

I can barely stand how I look in pictures and end up deleting a lot of them bc I hate how I look.

I’m not asking for compliments about my looks, but I’m seeking for some support. Any kind of positivity, experience, advice, etc would be really appreciated.

9,cnyman303,1614111406,"We all go through struggles and mine will always be different then yours. Sometimes finding that one speck of positivity in a bad situation can help. Even if it’s stupid like at least it didn’t rain today. It’s a mind set that’s not easy. 

Here is my example: I am slowly dying, my kidneys are failing and only work at about 15% and I have a 50/50 chance of my children having it too. So first bright side my oldest has been cleared he doesn’t have it but my youngest is 14 and we will not be testing her for it until 18 and out of high school. Now I know she is watching me decline just as I watched my mother when I was 14. My experience watching my mother decline was sad and always made me feel like she was trapped by the disease. So to keep this from happening we are doing things differently. 

1. I have more energy in the morning so on weekends we do morning activities so she doesn’t notice anything is wrong with me. 

2. We make up games that involve being out of the house yet safe in our car. (Drive with family in car, 1st person picks north south East or West then drive 30-60 mins you choose the amount. 2nd person then starts choosing left or right and next person picks the next left or right. Choose your total time limit and when time is up find a local spot to eat (support local business) and then drive home) I have some beautiful pictures from playing this game.

3. Sometimes you need to take a moment for yourself, you’re human and when the brain has decided to go haywire sometimes we have to ask for help. It took me 45 years to get past the ingrained notion that therapists are nosey and will just blame everything on your childhood. This is not the case and bright side my daughter watched me ask for help and knows it’s a good thing. She’s heard me many times laughing with my therapist while telling her the stupid shenanigans I get myself into so for her therapy looks like a great thing. 

4. You need love. The unconditional love that sometimes can only come from yourself. I have lost 150lbs and I have loose skin. Do I care that I look funny to other people.. nope.. do I want surgery to remove it so I look better.. nope. I had to have a gastric sleeve done because at my weight I was not allowed on the transplant list.. sounds sucky right but I did it. So honestly I could care less what people think about my arms looking like I have wings. I see them as more of a super hero cape because if I can lose it I can do anything. I’m not afraid to fail, I’ve faced death before so it’s not scary to me. I’ve decided everyday is important and bright side is I’m just not afraid anymore. I even learned how to tell people no. 

Ok so yes sometimes life sucks but you can make it easier with a positive attitude and live with love in your heart.",Positivity,Spreading the positivity in case someone needs it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/lqrwr0/spreading_the_positivity_in_case_someone_needs_it/,1614082606.0

Description:

“But I was just kidding.” Free speech with the intent to harm and degrade others can easily become bullying. We analyze what is bullying and how it is perpetuated within our social hierarchies. Understand why and how someone becomes a bully or the target of a bully (and sometimes both) as well as the role the bystanders play in perpetuating the cycle. Grasp the importance of recognizing the difference between teasing and taunting and flirting and sexual bullying.

Learn how to empower those who are targets, so they feel supported in speaking up. Silence can lead to struggles with mental health and even self-harming behaviors. We uncover the power issues around gender, race, religion, ethnicity, economic status, appearance, sexual identity and more. Learn ways to become a prosocial bystander and create lasting culture change within our communities.

I'm 100% sure it was her Spirit.(light body or whatever you wanna call it.)

I've read that we aren't aware of 90% of what is going on around us. (In terms of energy, electromagnetic fields, vibrations, spirits, angels, brainwaves, wavelengths, frequencies and ect.)

Personally I believe in this especially because I've experienced a lot of events that many would consider ""weird, hallucinations, paranormal and spiritual"".

One time I was Meditating ""Buddha style"" with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me.

Nowadays while thinking or talking to someone  I get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while. All varying in different colours. Nowadays I mostly see blue.

All of this has been happening to me since 2013 when I've started Meditating and getting really into spirituality. 

If you are interested I've made this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/Wl1hPZUFM3g) about which method of Meditation opened my awareness to be able to witness these sightings.

58,iamaninsect,1613830872,"Just a ramble because I’m happy. 

And I’ll preface this by saying I recognize my good fortune and privilege. I also know I’ve been a lucky duck during this pandemic, and really, over the last four years. I’m not religious, but I do believe in energies and karma. I feel the universe or the trees or SOMETHING has been watching over and protecting me. I can’t take credit for everything, because I feel like things like this just don’t happen the way they did for me. 

I won’t go into a huge spiel about my childhood. I’ll just note that it wasn’t the greatest. It was pretty rough and to make a long story short, my mother moved us far away from my hometown when I was about 15.

I was never happy. I wound up as kind of a broken 20-something for a long time. Always chasing after things I couldn’t have or that were bad for me. Getting so lost that I suddenly became an addict. Couch surfing, unable to hold down a job, lost all my friends, and eventually my car. My health wasn’t exactly at its best either, and worst of all, my family and I were barely talking anymore. I was just too much of a mess and at the time my little brother was only about 8. I couldn’t let him witness his big sister in such a sad place. 

It was the day my car died that I decided to scrap it for $300, took what little money and belongings I had, and trekked for four days on a Greyhound bus. (Not before getting so drunk and high the night before that I almost missed that bus, mind you, lol).

Looking back on that I don’t even know how I’m still alive some days. It was very dangerous to do that as a woman by herself with a lot of luggage. We drove through and stopped at all these shady stations in the bad spots of major cities. But I made it to my destination unscathed, and even the arrival has an insane story that I’ll save for another time. 

Once I arrived, I found some old family friends to live with, because I didn’t have close family or friends anymore (I had gone back to my childhood town). I got my feet firmly planted and started getting my shit together. I detoxed on the bus (again, HOW am I alive). I found a job within three weeks and started within a month. 

I worked as a temporary data entry clerk for about six months, when a permanent position opened up that perfectly matched my skill sets and experience. I knew I had a killer resume and could knock that interview out of the park.

And I did. 

And I’m still there. Even through this pandemic I’m still working full time. 

I’m even collecting bonuses. In the past two pay periods, I’ve collected appx $2300 net in bonuses, and I’ve been saving money to boot. 

I looked at my account yesterday and cried because I’ve never seen so much. It’s not even that much. It’s not enough to put a down payment on a house or anything. 

But I can now move back to my family. As extremely bittersweet as it’ll be to leave such an amazing job that I’ve been at for almost four years. To go back to a piddly job that probably won’t pay more than $12/hour. Starting from the bottom all over again. But it’s necessarily to be with them. And to help out during quarantines if necessary. My brother and I have such a good relationship now. He’s 14 and I want to watch him grow into adulthood. I feel like I can be part of the family again. 

I’m trying to keep this positive mindset going because I know starting over will be so annoying and such a huge step back. I’m gonna lose a lotttttt that I worked so hard for. But it needs to happen. The distance is too far and the pandemic has made it way too difficult to visit. 

But I just wanted to kind of bask in the fact that I’ve worked my way up to this level and I never thought I’d ever be up here. It isn’t some major goal like graduating university or being accepted to NASA or buying a home. It’s just the stability and knowing what I’m capable of that kind of made me feel proud of myself for the first time like... ever. 

I know leaving will be hard, but I also know that I’ve done it before. So I’m positive I can do it again.",Positivity,I am very proud of myself for the first time in a very long time,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/lo82g4/i_am_very_proud_of_myself_for_the_first_time_in_a/,1613802072.0

Hello,

So I'm having a case where I moved to a new place for a new job pursuing better career opportunities and I got some inner values conflict, that starts with...

\- too low salary (but I'm entry-level 2nd month yet), high working hours (startup) &amp; screen time

\- Distrust in myself. (career-wise I'm not sure how many years I have to dedicated to becoming a manager to get paid. + I feeling pressured at work to deliver doesn't help)

\- relationship with GF (there's sometimes doubts so we conflict)

\- household sharing with unknown people and life in a new place in general

\- friends and family that want attention (I don't get pressure), but still I get offers and calls (that costs time), and working long hours and having bad time managing skills requires to cut that attention. It's sad.

\- some BIG rumination on my insecurities, being pity about myself, having unhealthy ego battles about comparing to other people, and more...

Like, you get it there's a lot of going on my mind. IT'S ALWAYS ARE.

I'm not even sure what could be a dealbreaker here.

Even now I'm writing before work because I was snapped out of a dream and reflected 2 hours. 6hours of sleep instead of 8.30 will definitely affect my performance. BUT I wouldn't have time (due to work, travel &amp; household) to share if It wasn't for this.

SO despite my work performance will go down. THERE's a good thing - that reflection on a dream symbolism gave me some guidelines on the relationship puzzle to solve. And this reflection gives me some confidence that I'm: getting answers, know what I'm doing, have control in my life. When I'm not doing that and only working I feel down and I still procrastinate work and think about some of my life aspects that I'm worried about.

The thing is WHEN I focus on my feelings, inner reflection, and build the whole life picture I LOSE energy that is time and that affects my work results. When it affects my results I'm being pressured and micromanaged more. AND this is a natural consequence as I'm getting paid to deliver and concentrate on work as it's said ""It's not personal, it's just business"" so no feelings in work.

This whole situation is a big deal for me and its deal to live with it, somehow it's too damn hard.

My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.”

167,rover_brando,1613280620,"First post.

I understand it is in human nature to find the negative of the world interesting. I am intrigued myself. 
Well after years of chasing the negative, I began to realize I should stop allowing myself to be drawn into anything that has a ""negative energy"". People, places, jobs, ect. 

Fast forward to a few years of discipline and focus.
It is funny how the removal of toxicity has created a mindset of abundance and happiness. I see so many people still ""stuck"" and it saddens me to think that their negligence is holding them back from seeing the world from a healthier perspective. 

I feel as humans we are naturally always heading towards the negative (because this is the path of least resistance) and to become positive you must use your energy in ways that help breakdown the negative resistance. This is in the form of habits. 

Replace all negative habits with habits that allow you to grow. Do the work, trust the process. If you follow that simple rule anything is achievable. It requires persistence, patience and perseverance. 

Simply, life is worth living and the better you become the more you get to enjoy. It's all for the taking and being a positive energy is the catalyst that will bring all riches into your life.",Positivity,Why does humanity search for destruction over beauty...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/lji9ex/why_does_humanity_search_for_destruction_over/,1613251820.0
