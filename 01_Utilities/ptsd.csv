For whatever reason, my flashbacks and intrusive thoughts are mostly just in the form of nightmares lately. It started about 2 weeks ago. Normally I'll have one every so often, but this has been every night. To the point of avoiding sleep and waking up freaking out so I drink red bull and/or whiskey until I chill out or end up back asleep. 

Sometimes it's the events that I dream about and wake up not knowing where I am for a bit (when I relive events via a dream I wake up still continuing the dream. Time varies on when I actually convince myself I'm home). Other times I have dreams based around or with elements of events.

 I have at least one of these nightmares every night. As a result I'm always tired, can't focus, and I stay zoned out. I don't know why the sudden surge or how I can help myself here.

Two days ago my girl said she needed a month to take a break and I need to reflect on myself and the relationship. That was the moment my world collapsed.

I'm scared and worried that I won't start therapy in time to at least start making some progress on myself. I know it takes more than a month, it takes a lifetime to learn how to confront and cope with the problems. The thing is, she has never given any guys a break during a relationship so I am the first.  So I am asking for two things.

Hey all. first time on the subreddit

i've been looking into things and i'm wondering if i could have ptsd, or if it's just something else. i'm 16 and my psychiatrist told me i have some sort of depression or anxiety disorder but nothing has been diagnosed yet. i ask this because i'm unsure if it's worth getting evaluated for

There are a few reasons why i'm hung up about this. i don't know what a nightmare feels like. i have never gotten a panic attack in my life, just intense anxiety, and i don't know if what i feel are flashbacks or just intrusive thoughts + dissociation. (i dissociate quite often). My trauma all happened online through text so i have no physical sensory experiences to actually connect the event to, i just sort of see a blurry discord screen sometimes or remember words or thoughts

there have been times where i see something that's supposed to be a trigger but i don't feel anything. maybe it's just because i've trained myself to not feel mental pain like that but it scares me because i don't know if i'm just making all of this up. i've been dealing with this for about an entire year now, so it must be *something* but i have no idea what

i'm sorry this turned into a bit of a rant, if you have any questions please ask! thanks",ptsd,could i have ptsd?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lr4sgg/could_i_have_ptsd/,1614115969.0

Hey everyone… I’m new to Reddit, and I just wanted to thank you for responding to my thread… 

TLDR; my trauma anniversary just passed and it’s making my life a living hell. It’s been two weeks and I don’t know what to do.

To give some background, I’ve dealt with mental illness my whole life. I have Bipolar I, SAD, PMDD, and panic disorder. When I started school in Jan 2019, I was in between cycles with my bipolar. My cycles are unusually long lasting, but I do have periods of normalcy in between. I had not felt depressed, anxious, had not had a panic attack in years. Well in November 2019, I got sick. I was sad all the time and my stomach always bothered me. I figured it was just seasonal depression. Months past and I kept getting worse. To the point where my stomach pain was so bad I couldn’t sleep, and if I was sleeping my panic attacks would wake me up out of my sleep constantly as my body was sounding off alarm bells that something was seriously wrong. This was my daily reality for MONTHS. After a bunch of failed hospital visits being brushed off as probably being no big deal because of my normal bloodwork, one day three months later it got so unbearable I just finally went in. Turns out, I had chronic appendicitis and my appendix was getting ready to burst. They rushed me into surgery telling me that I was going to have a minimally invasive procedure and it wouldn’t take any more than 15 minutes. Well what they didn’t know was my intestines were in the wrong place... they had to go DIGGING for my appendix after splitting me down the middle (midline laparotomy) leaving a 10 inch incision on my stomach. When I woke up I was in so much pain I didn’t know what to do. The pain medicine had me so delirious I was laying in a hospital bed so distressed I was crying and hallucinating. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t move. I was in so much pain. I thought I was going to die in that hospital. Recovery took 11 weeks, and it wasn’t easy. Well, my surgery was a year ago on February 7th, and ever since that exact day passed I have been so depressed and anxious. My insomnia is torturous, my nocturnal panic attacks are getting really bad (I struggled for a while during recovery but they eventually tapered off but didn’t go away completely) my stomach constantly hurts like phantom pain by my scar and I cry everyday... i still cry thinking about what I went through... is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? When will it go away... it’s been a little over two weeks and I’m just beside myself.... I don’t know what to do anymore. I just need some advice from someone who’s been there. TIA 💔",ptsd,Anniversary reaction help,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lr2ehz/anniversary_reaction_help/,1614108153.0

I just had the most horrific fight with my narcissistic mother and told how I feel about her abandoning me  when I got my PTSD diagnosis, leaving us for the holidays, missing my birthday among other things. 

It started over something small and just snowballed. I took animal food dishes away after she’d put them down, we were arguing because she’s almost never home and had made the animals sick with the amount of food she gives them and won’t listen that they’re on a schedule and as I there then out she cornered me in our kitchen, tried to snatch the bowls out of my hands and then screamed at me and blocked me from leaving the room despite me yelling at her that I didn’t want to talk and for her to let me through. She tried to justify that she’s a mom and they’re nothing wrong with the fact that she wants to preserve her relationship with my rapist.
She known for years, I told right after it happened and she still choose my rapist instead. I was finally let out when I reminded her that she isn’t a real mother anymore since she referred to my rape as’ kids f**king around’ 
Then out of spite because I shut her down and walked away she reminded me that my rapist was a big part of my life and caused me to have flashback and nearly a panic attack. And I let her know how negatively she effects my mental health and that her not being around made it improve across the broad. I felt defiled and disgusting. It needed to happen, she hasn’t spoken to me in months and I had to let it out. 

Now since my folks are getting divorced I’ve now learned that not only will I probably lose the only hole I know, I also won’t be able to move in with my dad for sometime once it’s finalized  and frankly I’m sacred. I wasn’t expecting this to happen, if anything I’ve been avoiding it because I was worried about fallout. I don’t know how to feel because as cathartic as it was to let her know the truth, now I’ve learned how dire my situation is and I already suffer with rampant anxiety and I don’t know if it was the right thing anymore.

I know it needed to happen. She been a very emotionally and psychologically abusive and well as emotionally manipulative. I couldn’t take it anymore. I brought up how could she care when she left up for holidays and birthdays? How could she call herself a mother when she’s called me a ‘ cee u next Tuesday’ on more than one occasion for no real reason? Her response was I probably deserved it and when I brought up how she didn’t care for my mental illness she said she was trying to understand while also admiring she’ll never attend a therapy session with me. My father had on multiple occasions and he was never someone who thought they would. 

And now it really hitting me that I’m losing my home, that a year from now I may not have one or sooner.

I have been experiencing a low self esteem in my all life. I had to solve many troubles before attacking this one. Now I'm ready to improve my self-esteem. But I don't know how can I do it.

For example, I don't know what is important. It's true time and money is important, but I don't care giving my time or money to people who need more.

Also I know I can out some boundaries. But I don't feel attack when people speak badly about me. For example, a gf quit me, and when she quit me, she talked badly about me : you have strange smells sometimes, sometimes you are away and you look stupid, I don't like handsome men, you are average and it's better, I have better sex with a previous partner, I have a high sense of hygiene, and you are too roots for me. But I don't feel offended when they say that, but I neither hurt. But people feel they can say anything to me, and it unbalance our relationship.

So what i'm getting pretty much is a mix of me feeling scared &amp; upset cut with total emptiness non stop ( they switch out super fast, kinda like scared numb scared numb in like 10 secs) combined with me feeling spacey, dreamy, rigid,heavy, tired to super alert &amp; light and feeling sensations from my traumas like tasting stuff, feeling physical sensations from back then alll over (like everywhere not just like in one place like i usually do), with at times me feeling one of the people who hurt me be right there, real close to me",ptsd,Are these flashbacks?

Quick story short, I've been molested by my older brother age 6 to 8, he is 5 years older than me. I kind of pretended it never happened for 20 years, just locking it in a corner of my head. 

However, I recently started asking for help and talking more about it. I'm having nightmares pretty much every night. Relieving things, being forced to tell my family what happened and being shamed for it. 

My question is: does anyone else can't really function on the day they have nightmares? I'm just so unproductive, frozen and kind of dead inside? My husband says I take ""nightmares too seriously"" and that's ""its just a nightmare""
But to me, it feels so much worse than an average nightmare, like the ones I used to have before I opened that ""Pandora box"".

I hope I make sense.

She potty trained him, fed him, trained him how to sit, play fetch, etc. They were inseparable. I honestly have never seen a dog bond with a young child like that in my life. He was very special. My heart breaks for her. I can always feel the sadness coming from her and I comfort her as much as I can. We talk about him and it’s always about the fun things they did together. When she starts to get sad, I just hold her and tell her we will never forget him, that we’ll always love him and it’s ok to miss him and feel the things that come with it. That missing someone is just a part of loving them. I told her that sometimes we feel like we can’t stop the sadness, so we try to go over it, or under it, but the only way out of it is to get through it and we can do that together.

58,yasssaf,1614035061,"The main reason i'm sharing my story is to give hope for those who had recent traumatic events. It's not easy, but it gets better.
And the second reason is to learn from other people how did they mange their bad dreams/nightmares.

7 years ago I've been abducted by a terrorist group in Syria, and kept in small room with another 100 men for four months. And from the first day the intensive torture started. Torture that kept my arms paralysed for long months afterword and left scares on every inch of my body and my soul. I will not talk about further torture details.
By a miracle i was able to convince them that I can't pay the ransom and let me go after four months. Even though I had enough money to pay the ransom but if I did I will not be able to forgive myself financing terrorist, My choice was to stick to my story that i lost everything after my office was bombed.
A month later I was abducted again from the regime intelligence accusing me of supporting the terrorist group and after a week an officer offered me my freedom if I leave him my car and I accepted it and left the country immediately.
I lived a year in Istanbul taking care of my sick parents and spent most of that year in hospitals with them and didn't have the time to take care of myself and look after my physical and mental injuries.
After my Father died in Istanbul i wasn't able to live there anymore after I spent most of my life savings, so I decided to flee with my mom and my widowed-Sister and her kids in a rubber boat with another 35 person to Greece and then to Germany.

Since 2015 I live in Berlin, started working immediately after i arrived in a TV production company and since then i'm trying to collect what's left of my soul and trying to live a happy life, or at least a normal life.
It took my years to coup with my past, to accept what happened to me. And believe it or not after a year of therapy I am able to feel normal again and live myself and life. I've learnt to gain strength from my experiences and get anything positive I can from all the pain I've been throw. It was very difficult and slow, but it's doable, and believe me IT GETS BETTER.

The nightmares didn't stop even after 7 years of the incidents and i'm tired of it.
My therapist told me that i don't have control over my dreams, and i need to learn to live with them. But it's easier said than done.
Always the same concept, someone want to abduct my and hurt me and i wake up scared to death almost every night. Except the two years i was smoking weed. Smoking helped stopping all kind of dreams but a few months ago i stoped smoking because i'm studying now.

I think many of people who had/has PTSD has the same dreams/nightmares problem. Can you please tell me how do you deal with it.

I have one last word for people reading who has PTSD, believe me when I said before it gets better, I know it sucks ... a lot, but the moment you give up, you will be stuck with it for the rest of your life. Don't let that happen and don't the people who hurt you have control on the rest of your life. It takes a lot of work and months of emptiness and darkness, but it does get better.

this was going to go to r/did but the account needs to be 72 hours old and i just made this lol



i'm really sick of living like this. i've tried calling social security to see if i can get on disability but the first time i called she said, insisted, i needed 10 years of work credits. i think she needs to be informed of child labor laws because 10 years ago i was just starting middle school. it's a joke.

the second time i called, after finding this was blatantly untrue, i was told i needed to be out of work for six months to be on disability. i'm not even sure if this is true either but it made me give up for a while. push through. it feels hopeless. with my rent, groceries, utilities, and saving up to even have some possibility of doing anything with my life, the amount i'd need to make from a job in combination with SSI or SSDI or whatever would put me over the financial requirements anyway.

i feel like i've been set up for failure. i haven't finished high school. i moved around too much. my mental health is too bad to even consider it. i've been working a factory job since november i think which i'm grateful for but it's completely destroying me. it's 40 hours a week. i really need it but it makes me feel like dying. i've already missed some days already, in part due to PTSD/DID, in part because i got a stomach bug or something. not enough to consider firing me but enough for me to make a trip to HR to ask for an extra day off every two weeks because of my mental health.

he asked me if i was seeing a therapist, i said yes, i just started seeing someone. he said, you should see improvements in about eight weeks then. implying if i kept this up any longer i'd have no excuse.

two months to see improvements from two decades of abuse. i've been in and out of therapy most of my life. i guess i've already failed that one.

how do you tell your employer, or anyone really, that you can't go to work because the second you wake up you feel you've woken from a long dream consisting of the entirety of your childhood? how do you tell your employer that you can't make it today because you're actually not you, you're not even an adult today, you're just a child who's tired of working, someone who can't handle this responsibility, and all he knows how to deal with the situation is to cry and go back to sleep?

i'm having so many voices in my head fighting all the time and it's so hard to keep it up. i want to lay down but i've got another two hours before work ends and an appointment after that and then i wake up again tomorrow at 5 and it starts again. over and over and over and no time or energy left to even think of completing high school which might be the only thing that could possibly give me some ounce of peace if it wouldn't potentially kill me.

i don't really know what i want from this. someone smarter than me to tell me to get off my ass and it's not that hard, everyone has a job, you should be grateful you even have one right now and what are you going to do? hide in your room in your bed until you run out of money? die? or someone to give me a solution. something to make this all end and somehow i'll be happy because the problem isn't me. i'm doing everything right and i've done nothing wrong actually, it's the world that sucks and is so mean and if i just ask the right person, they'll give me the life i deserve on a silver platter and i'll never have to worry anymore.

I’ll put my review I left on Google reviews first and then say more about my experience.


 1/5 stars
Honestly, I can’t even begin to start with what went wrong. I’ve had to go through even more therapy because of the trauma I’ve been through here and the abuse I’ve received. I was basically socially outcasted for a month (my parents pulled me out after a month) and I remember a patient was made to clean up another patient’s shit and the staff got physical with patients sometimes. There were fights all the time and the staff barely did anything about it and some of the staff were pretty rude, I can’t remember all the names though. The food was pretty bad too. There were basically no good activities. It wasn’t clean and my room had bugs and filth. I was crying every day cuz I missed home and my therapist didn’t do much to help and in fact she called me a manipulator for crying. I tried to kill myself in there and still didn’t receive therapy for another 3 weeks and mrs bretski was a horrible therapist. Another patient was making threats towards me and mrs bretski told me I just had to deal with it and a week later she came into my room and started beating me and it took a long time for them to pull her out even after I was screaming bloody murder and she got no punishment. I was sent to the other wing on the hall with the other half of the girls but they let the girl that beat me up on that wing and she beat me up again. I thought that maybe writing a review would help me because it’s a warning for parents, I hope that no one has to go what I’ve gone through.

That’s my review on the site, I’ll explain more. They wouldn’t do anything for fights and the girl who beat me up left bruises all over the side of my head and my neck and shoulder and she kept punching those areas over and over and over and it took them a long time to pull her out. Sometimes when we were walking, if you were slightly out of line they would tackle you down to the ground with brute force and they broke a kids chin and almost neck when she was pushed down I heard. People tried to run all the time, there was a group of really strong men that tackled and put kids in holds and sedated kids called fao and they would drive around in a van picking kids up. Also, once I was brushing my teeth and I vomited partly because I was so stressed and my gag reflex, and they saw the chunks of pineapple and made me eat it out of the sink because it was “good food”. They also made a girl clean up someone else’s shit and didn’t care when I attempted suicide and there was a problem with people smuggling razors in and they didn’t know for a long time.",ptsd,My abuse at San Marcos treatment center in the girls depression ward,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lpszby/my_abuse_at_san_marcos_treatment_center_in_the/,1613983168.0

75,Book-Illustrious,1614009648,"Hello! I just recently saw a psychologist who believes I may have ptsd with psychotic features and I've been feeling a bit alone and confused and I was wondering if anyone here has experienced this and can maybe give me some tips for coping with it when left to my own devices. 

I previously would disassociate heavily when I was a child because I was being abused in my home. Later, when I started to get into spirituality I started to experience various things that at the time I perceived as ""spirits"" because it was positive at the time. Those things were voices at various random points, imagery and ""spirits"" but not in my mind it was me seeing it with my eyes, and tactile sensations. It wasn't until later down the line my disassociation got worse and I stopped seeing things, started having intrusive thoughts and memories, started having a disconnection with my thoughts (heard them in a voice that wasn't my head voice and felt like they weren't coming from ME but were saying the things I wanted to think) and experienced voices which would tell me horrible, immoral, or rude things, tactile hallucinations which are scary and uncomfortable. This along with loss of motor function at various points throughout my day (usually just me saying slurs to myself outloud that I didn't want to say, me sometimes hitting myself or on rare occasions it felt like I was completely trapped inside of myself and was cognizant of it but couldn't move or control myself). It also sometimes comes with this very terrifying creature I sense or perceive that I saw just before things started to become very unhealthy and horrible to endure that's like this evil 18th century looking womens silhouette that has this smoke all around her that's suffocating. Scariest thing ever..idk if it's like...a...idek but it's terrifying and I'm very fearful of it.

Lately I've really really been feeling alone...and if I'm being honest...I'm confused as to whether this is real (due to my spiritual background please don't judge me trust me ik it sounds nuts) or if I'm just out of my mind. I tried to talk to those around me about it because before when I was just thinking that it's a spiritual thing...they essentially told me I need to go see someone (Rightfully so, I'm glad I did) but when I go see someone they told me that it's obviously real because it's been ""proven"" (alot of mental health professionals I've went to don't think there's anything wrong with me because I tend to present well ie I'm not catatonic or have mania or act out like other mental health patients you'd see in facilities I've gotten help now but before it was a bit rough) and that I need to stop thinking it's just me being crazy. One of them even told me ""Are you sure that's not just how brains work"" and ""Are you sure you haven't just deeply convinced yourself that you're mentally ill""...so idk what to do or who to talk to about any of this anymore. I feel like I'm simultaneously being called crazy and sane at the same time and it's just confusing me. It's like I was gaslighted one way because they didn't believe me when I thought it was spiritual..but now that I'm focusing on my mental more and changed psychiatrists...all of a sudden it's real..I was ""right"" I need to ""listen to my intuition"" (which I had a psychiatrist the whole time and was seeing him consistently, it's just he didn't really think it was that severe since I was in school and could keep a job at the time and seemed exceptionally ""high functioning"" according to him and my therapist)

i just want to feel okay again. i had a partner a few years ago (its been two years since i broke up with them) and it was bad. i was in a very emotionally vulnerable place so i ignored the many red flags and ended up emotionally abused and sexually assaulted. after we broke up, i did not know how to cope and i would make alt accounts to look at their fb to see if they regretted anything, but they never did. and they never will. i know it was wrong of me, and my abuser never let me forget it as they held that over me (but it was ok for them to harass me, to get around me blocking them with alt accounts to harass me, emailing me to harass me, and texting me on a new number to harass me since i blocked theirs)

I would guess they still tell people I was the emotionally abusive one, their argument being that since i had a pattern of seeking out negative attention (basically i'd become friends with people who i knew would be abusive, because i was convinced i could not live in any other way than as an abuse victim), then that means I had been baiting them to abuse me the entire relationship by specificially targeting symptoms of their mental illnesses. to me it sounds absolutely far-fetched, but i remember at the height of the smear campaign against me that they received a lot of messages of support for what they allegedly went through. 

and today i still doubt myself! even when they admitted to things most consider rape - like pressuring me until i said yes, making advances while im physically pushing them away, and guilt tripping me for saying no - i still doubt myself, because they said it wasnt rape and that im lying when i say it is. they apologized in that convo but wouldnt call it what it was.",ptsd,two years and I can't get over it,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lpble8/two_years_and_i_cant_get_over_it/,1613927772.0

102,rubiesintherough,1613946091,"25/F. Lots of triggers in this one from cocsa, to sexual assault, to child abuse / neglect, and, of course, ptsd and all that comes with it.   

My parents are shitty. Putting it mildly. All my life, they've been extremely fundamental Christians, and have used that doctrine as excuses for why it was acceptable to treat me the way they did... I actually recall a few times they straight up told me that I should be grateful I was 'only' getting beaten because, if we lived in biblical times, I would have been stoned for acting the way I was. 
Now, I think it's important to point out that I was the child they singled out. While they certainly disciplined my siblings, it was never to the extent they took mine. Theirs stopped at spankings. Mine didn't. It started that way, though, with me being told to bend over a certain footstool in the living, pull down my pants and underwear, and be spanked across the back of my thighs with a metal wire end of a flyswatter until I was trying not to scream. The youngest I remember them doing this, I was 6. When I developed depression and they decided they couldn't handle me anymore, they sent me to a private school... Having been homeschooled my entire life until that point, I was a fish out of water, didn't fit in, was bullied and mocked my students and teachers alike. I told my parents. They didn't care. And when it finally got to the point I would refuse to get out of bed to go to school, my parents set aside the flyswatter in favor of a long, wooden rod. They gave up trying to wake me up the normal way. Instead, they would rip my blankets off and beat me out of a sound sleep... That was how I started my morning for a month before they finally, finally pulled me out of the hellish school. 
I can't tell you how many times I was slapped by my mom. Even the smallest disagreement seemed to escalate and she would backhand me so hard my glasses would fly off and hit the opposite wall, once knocking a lens out of the frame. My dad once, while I was washing dishes, told me to move my hands and a split second later, apparently not fast enough, he proceeded to pour boiling vegetable water over them. That's part of the reason I no longer have feeling in my hands, now.  One time, when my older brother and I were arguing like children do, in the backseat on the way home, my dad stopped the car, opened the hatch, grabbed our heads and bashed them together at full force to get us to stop. I remember feeling woozy afterward. I was a child. He's fucking lucky neither of us were concussed from it. 
They would deny me medical care, even in serious situations. When I had asthma attacks so bad I would hyperventilate and pass out and, in some cases stop breathing all together for a minute, they would act like I was being dramatic. One instance that will be forever seared in my brain is when I had fallen on the dining floor, was curled up, gasping for breath... And my mom stepped right over me to get to the bathroom.     When I became extremely sick with mono and was bedridden, I lost 60 pounds in the span of a month. Knowing what I know now, I should have, at the very least, been brought to a clinic to be checked out... Ideally, I should have been in the hospital, hooked up to Ivs. They did neither. They barely even checked up on me during that time.       And when I did get medical care, my mom wouldn't speak up if they were doing something wrong. I was  a preteen and wound up stepping on a toothpick that went into my foot. My mom tried to pull it out herself. I blacked out. She told me not to be dramatic, but took me in and they cut it out... No anaesthetic. Just a scalpel. I was crying, trying not to scream, and my mom said nothing. That's why I have a severe phobia of clinical and hospital settings. 
My mom took a particular interest in my weight when I became a teenager. There were multiple times she would call me into her bedroom, hold up a pair of my jeans, stretch out the waistband as far as it would go, and start saying things like, ' this is unacceptable. You're too fat. No one will love you if you aren't skinny'. This led to me having eating disorders that I'm still fighting, now.    When I was fighting severe depression and selfharming, I made the mistake of walking through the living room, not knowing my family was in there. My younger brother saw the bandaids. He asked what it was. My mom told him to ignore me because I was doing it for attention. 

My older brother used to grab me sexually, tell me to flash him, ect, from the time I was 8 to 15... he was older by 4 years, well old enough to understand how wrong that was. He would get violent with me for the littlest thing. Once, for talking back to him, he threw me against the basement door and started beating me until I coughed up blood. As mentioned before, I was neglected medical care a lot when I was younger so, even after I told my mom was tasting blood, she brushed it off. He would hit me often. He would constantly get me into trouble for things I didn't do, I think feeling glee everytime he saw me getting beaten. Just a few years ago, I wound up having to live with him in our late grandparents home to look after the place and he would trash it. Now, I have chronic health issues in the form of debilitating pain. And I would have to push through it and clean up after him, even if I was on the edge of blacking out, because it wasn't bad enough he would wreck the entire house... But also our aunt would stop by for surprise visits (read: inspections) and she'd somehow gotten it in her head that I was supposed to be the one solely responsible for keeping the place clean, and that I was the one trashing it, despite me trying multiple times to tell her the truth. My brother made no attempt to clear it up or take responsibility. In fact, he was the only one with a lock on his door, so he would hide in his bedroom and let me take the fall until she left.. then proceed to undo all progress I'd made. And when I say 'trash' I don't mean a few dishes here or there, or maybe some garbage on the counter. No, dirty laundry all across the living floor and his room, rotting food in his room, garbage everywhere, his belongings ( including unprotected game discs, which by the way, he once made me pay to have repaired for him) just haphazardly dropped on any surface. Dirty dishes everywhere, more than any human should feasibly use in a day. And I would have to clean up all of it on my own. It was worse that my mom enabled it. I was constantly telling her how bad it was, but he was her golden child. He could do no wrong. It was me being dramatic, again, it was me making a fuss. And I'd be left to listen to my aunt's threats of kicking us out, calling us lazy, ect. I still get a panic attack if the place I'm living now gets too unorganized. 

My younger sister is a master manipulator. She knew how to use crocodile tears and she used them well. Cute, skinny, little blonde thing, she could charm anyone including our parents. I only ever remember her being spanked once. 
She would make it a point to boss me around. She would get me into trouble for things I didn't do, racing to mom with misty eyes to tell her how terrible I was being, likely in hopes she'd see me slapped or spanked. She would put me down, calling me fat, calling me stupid, calling me lazy. She was the least of the offenders, though. More arrogant and controlling than anything. 

Then there's my younger brother. Younger by almost 8 years, but bigger than me. Much bigger. Remember how I mentioned my mom would mock me for my weight? Well, I was never more than slightly pudgy... My younger brother is morbidly obese to the point I genuinely worry about his health. Yet, mom says nothing, does nothing, and tells me off when I mention my concerns. So there's that taste of delicious hypocrisy. Secondly, he's violent. He knows he's big and he uses that to his advantage. Once when I was staying with them, my mom head to go into town and asked me to get my brother off his laptop so he would do his chores. In response to this, he grabbed my arm and told me he was going to break it if i didn't give it back. At the time, I was still almost dangerously underweight and couldn't defend myself, and he grabbed me and threw me into the bookcase in his room. He's shoved me into walls. He's punched me as hard as he can in the gut. His anger is quick and he gets physical fast, and likes solving issues with violence. 

The only member of my family who isn't on my shit list is my older sister. She and I get along. She's someone I consider a close, blood related friend. 

Outside the family... My first boyfriend didn't like to take no for an answer. At the age of 15, I was repeatedly coerced, guilted, and threatened through hints of selfharm, into doing sexual acts I didn't want to do, that made me uncomfortable... Especially considering I had grown up hearing those  l o v e l y  purity analogies like chewed gum for a girl's virginity, that are rampant in fundamental Christianity. He proceeded to stalk me and get back in contact with me for months after I finally broke up with him.     I was assaulted by another man when I was 18. 

I'm so glad I'm away from all those shitty people, now. Engaged to a wonderful man, living hours away from my abusers... But I'm still feeling the effects. I have diagnosed ptsd. I have nightmares, flashbacks. I get shaky at certain sounds and sensations. I feel nauseous if anyone is even slightly upset with me. I get the urge to starve myself so I'm 'pretty enough' to deserve to be loved. I want to face down my abusers and make them explain to me why the hell they thought what they did to me was acceptable. But, the last time I tried, my mom told me it was all my fault for being a difficult child and I pushed them to it...

If I’m hot and I make it colder in the room, I switch to freezing and I can never just get to a comfortable temperature where I’m just sitting there existing peacefully.

This might sound like a stupid little thing but it actually greatly impacts my life and is something that happens on a daily basis and really needs to be addressed. 

I work from home as a reseller and I’m rarely as productive as I should be because I’m always “dying” of cold/heat and therefore “can’t” do any work. Then the guilt from not being productive eats me up.

I’ve gone to a bunch of different doctors and there’s nothing physically causing me to be the wrong temperature so it’s basically all in my head. Or at least my inability to tolerate it is a mental thing. 

I need to be tougher. I need to be able to suck it up and just say “too bad, it doesn’t matter that I’m hot/cold, I’m going to do ___ anyway”. 

I literally miss out on doing things in life because I’m so freezing that all I can stand to do is be in bed with my heating blanket. Or I’ll be outside somewhere and I’ll literally have to leave wherever I am because I need air conditioning immediately because I can’t stand the heat. And I live in Pennsylvania so it’s not like it’s the desert or or something.

Why is my distress tolerance so low and how can I fix this? It’s making me miss out on life!

Also before anyone asks, yes I’m in therapy and on meds, but we’re currently working on my childhood trauma and I don’t want to interrupt that for this right now. So I’d just like to get some temporary help for this until I can get some help from my therapist after the trauma stuff.

114,bigchipshi,1613920344,"I don’t even know where to begin.  My grandmother is the most toxic and vile person that I have ever come across.  Not only just in real life either, but even across movies and TV shows.  I can’t think of a more disgusting repulsive human being.  

My first ever memory from my childhood is of her beating the shit out of me.  I couldn’t have been more than 6 years old.  I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  

This is about par for the course for grandma.  In my family they say, “oh it’s just grandma being grandma.  Just don’t think about it.”

I guess that’s just what you say when you’ve spent a life time taking beatings from this fucking midget ogre.  I hear my mom and her sisters took beatings even worse than we did.  I still remember her losing her mind and beating the living pulp out of my brother and my cousin.  My grandpa had to tackle her and restrain her on numerous occasions.  Prying whatever object out of her hands that she decided would be the tool she would use to beat us with; Broom handle, wooden beating paddle, bare knuckles with rings, didn’t matter. 

It’s not like we were the worst kids in the entire fucking world either.  Like we deserved to be beaten that way.  All you had to do was look at her funny, or say something in the wrong tone, or disagree with her, or express your feelings, or just simply exist and be around her.  Didn’t matter.  If she wanted to dish out a beating, simply because she felt like it, well then you were going to catch a beating.  

For some reason, everybody in my family still supports and sympathizes with this tragic waste of human life.  I can only imagine this must be due to Stockholm syndrome.  I sure as hell don’t fucking understand it.  Fuck her.  

The first and only time that I (or anybody for that matter) ever tried to stand up to her I almost died.  She was calling my girlfriend a slut because she like to wear thigh high skirts.  I told her so what, I like the way she dresses and that’s all that matters.  She told me her parents should be ashamed of her, I interrupted her and told her “yeah but you’re not her parents,  she can do whatever she wants and she can wear whatever she wants.  You are not her mother.”  Grandma screams at me “EXCUSE ME!  DONT YOU EVER TALK TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER THAT WAY!  YOU LISTEN AND SHUT UP!”  To which I carelessly and recklessly replied “fuck you, go fuck yourself.  Nobody cares what you think”

She grabbed the biggest knife out of the kitchen, at minimum a 12” kitchen utility knife, and trotted her fat ass right towards me.  Fire burning in her eyes.  I jumped out of my chair and threw it behind me in the hopes that it would get in her way and slow down her chase.  She stops at the other end of the kitchen table.  I’m at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she’s right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she’s going to fucking kill me.  

I call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I’ve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.  The cops escort me out as my my grandmother screams and yells to the cops to arrest me, to kick me out of her house.  I walk out quietly and tell the cops I just want to leave and go to my friends house.  They oblige.  

This woman, my grandma, this piece of shit Is the reason that I suffer from PTSD.  I don’t believe in a heaven or a hell, there is no reasoning or justice for the bull shit that she’s out me through, but I hope she spends eternity suffering a miserable existence.  I don’t care what or where that is, just make her as miserable as she’s made the rest of this world.  

Fuck you grandma you lousy piece of shit.  I don’t give two shits about your final days here on earth.  I hope it hurts, I hope you regret everything.  I will never forgive you.  You are not my family.  We may be related by blood, but you are not my family.  I get to choose the people in my family.

I later saw how bad he really was when I tried to keep my mum from seeing him. One side of his face was really messed up and his one eye was staring right at me in the moment my mum pulled back the car door. I made eye contact with him but he wasn't there anymore. 

I'm a photographer and I was asked to look for pictures of him. I agreed out of wanting to take part in organising his funeral but also hoping that seeing his smiling face would erase my last image of him. But it didn't work and now I'm constantly getting flashes of his body, his face and his eye in my mind and I can't make it stop. I've been having some nightmares too but not many.

 I've tried talking to my partner and close family about how it's affecting me but I guess I'm doing it wrong or they don't want to talk about it? Or they just don't know what to to about it? Idk but now I'm starting to feel a bit like a burden saying how I can't stop seeing my uncle's face.

Last year, five days before my birthday I was sexually assaulted. There was no penetration, but I was forced to perform oral and was treated like some hooker (he thought I was one until I kept telling him I wasn't and needed to get home. He kept my head down and try to hand me a crack pipe. He even gave me money and thought I'd want to see him again). I felt so numb when I got home and my mom yelled and demanded where I was. I just handed her the money he gave me and told her I didn't want it then I just broke down sobbing. It was the hardest I've ever sobbed. I can still vividly remember everything and it makes my body ache and my skin crawl. I also get mad at myself because of it (I decided to hitchhike because I was going to be late and I knew my mom was expecting me to be home soon). The only reason I stayed in that car was because I was more scared at the thought of my mom being really upset with me. I've only told my parents about it, but sometimes I just feel so invalidated about what I've been through. I just want to keep blaming myself. I've been through another traumatic event before (I've heard my parents physically fight before more than once and my ex tormented me by stalking me and involving my family in his dangerous antics). But it's this more recent event that's gotten to me. And I can't see my birthday the same way, I know all I'll think about is what happened and how I could've stopped it. When I think about it too much, I can feel myself tensing up, I tightly hold on to whatever is near me, and I try to hold back my tears (which never really works). Sometimes I wish I ran out of there and sometimes I wish I wasn't so naive. I thought about taking this to the police, but I've dealt with them before (had to deal with an insane ex but they never even ARRESTED him and he got away with it) and I knew they wouldn't be able to help.

My adoptive fathers death anniversary is coming up and today was my day to mourn him. I looked around the house to find things that reminded me of him. I sprayed his perfumes and called his phone to hear his voicemail. And then I stumbled upon something I hadn’t seen in years, my baby teeth. The memories came flooding back and I remembered that every time I had a loose tooth that I would run to him because he loved the sound of teeth cracking when it separated. And I don’t know why but the memory brought back everything I had ever experienced in my life. 

God I remember all the effort I had wasted in my life mourning those who had hurt me. The times I had cut my thigh into a pulp and the last time I tried to commit suicide and failed. All those years wasted on people who only felt remorse because they were caught. And today I felt fucking rage at the thought of them. 

How I spent my years crying for daddy because my brother was raping me or because he was trying to drown me again. And all daddy did was stare and turn a blind eye, and  get mad at me when I was scared of bathrooms and hangers. When I would piss my pants out of fear so he would whip me purple and blue. 

Today I realized that I’m angry and I couldn’t be happier. This is the first time I’ve screamed in years and god it felt good. I remember when my adoptive parents first heard of what was happening. How they immediately sprung into action and called cps and adopted me in a matter of a few years. And when they won the court case and my adoptive dad hugged me and promised me something in a language I couldn’t  understand. The only dad who had ever protected me is gone and there’s nothing I can do but be grateful for having saved me and taught me to have self respect.

Now people were defending pedophilia in a discord server, which I said was awful and tried arguing back and asking the moderators why they wouldnt ban the topic all together, and in the heat of the moment I briefly mentioned of sexual abuse when I was 7 or 9 (cant remember the age).

I tried reasoning with them as to why pedophilia, even if its 2d is bad, and they just called me insane and crazy, which is just cursed honestly.

I left the convo due to a message that actually upset me and I just didnt feel like arguing about it anymore, especially since mods werent going to do anything, as that wasnt the first time I had argued about it. (and the server had big problems with it, like daily)

So 15 ish minutes after I left the convo, they pinged me, saying they'd rape me and called me a delusional whore.
Now I had never get sad over my ptsd, I just got to ignore it in away, since I am good at ignoring my problems.

I suppose due to the meds that my hormones and all that have been closer to normal I am more emotional, but in anycase I still had a massive panic attack, which I haven't had before from my ptsd until now.

She said maybe I need to come off Zoloft and try a different medicine. Instead of focusing on these new symptoms of PTSD and anxiety, she wanted to focus on why I was prescribed Zoloft in the first place, which was OCD. Zoloft has worked great for me. I don’t want to be off of it. Yes it’s not a miracle worker, but it’s keeping me from going over the edge. 

Then she said maybe the anxiety was caused by low thyroid and vitamin D levels. 

Maybe an increase in vitamin D would help, but I’m pretty sure the majority of my anxiety is from watching my mom die a sudden unexpected death.

And then she said she would refer me to a psychiatrist. She never sent me the psychiatrist referral. She had a counselor come in who said that my mom would visit me in my dreams when I am ready because she doesn’t want to visit me when I am so upset. What the fuck. 

I understand her not being able to treat me, but at least listen to me. Or at least give me the referral. 

Money is tight atm so I can’t afford a psychiatrist and therapist like I need to right now. That’s why I went to a general doctor to just give me medicine that I’ve been on for a decade.

I can’t wait until my psychiatrist visit. I can’t 
keep taking Xanax daily (it’s pharmacy Xanax, atleast). They’re not a prescription, but they’re given by a doctor as needed, and it seems like I’ve been needing them everyday.

Jan 28 was the absolute worse day for me mentally, despite no physical symptoms. Jan 18 was pretty bad mentally too even though I had physical symptoms. 

What I felt Jan 28 mentally has caused me to be anxious everyday, have random panic attacks, and whenever I have a normal heart palpitation, the ones that everyone has, I need to sit down and remind myself it’s normal. 

Jan 28 ended 7 months of stimulant dependence. I can no longer enjoy weed, and I’ve enjoyed it for four years. Last time I ate an edible my heart rate went to 170bpm and I had to walk outside. It wasn’t the highest I’ve ever been, but it was the worst experience I’ve ever had with weed.

I have 2 siblings who are both prescribed citalopram (celexa) 10mg because we all have anxiety and they would have panic attacks randomly. 

However, my anxiety started Jan 18, and intensified after Jan 28. Is it likely that I’ll end up being given the same medication as them? I have not touched any stimulants since Jan 28, I have not gotten high since over a week, but still suffer from the worry that something is wrong with my heart/breathing (likely ptsd from jan18 because that’s the only time something was legitimately wrong with me physically.

I’ve never woken myself up gasping or with an abnormal heart rate so I’m sure it’s all mental.

Then I withdrawn and shut down and become numb again...and sometimes that is okay, but ultimately...I hate it. I HATE this!

Kissing, holding, caressing, sex, etc...all of it! All of it...

136,Musictheory_nerd,1613868558,"Ugh, I wish that my brain would shut up sometimes! Several weeks ago, I read an article about false memories and now I keep agonizing over whether my trauma is actually a false memory. The biggest thing that makes me doubt myself is that although I've always had memories of certain parts of the trauma, I only remembered the most traumatic part of it last year through a very bad flashback. My memories of the trauma (which happened when I was a young child) are spotty, but they have great sensory detail (when I have a flashback I physically feel what happened in my body). I'd also like to note that although I haven't told my mom, she actually asked me completely unprompted whether the person who abused me ever did anything inappropriate (which I denied because I was too ashamed to say anything else) due to the fact that she remembers me being terrified to go to the bathroom when my abuser was around.  I guess this is what a person could call independent evidence?  

Also, I read that false memories are usually induced by hypnotherapy or suggestion, and I've never been hypnotized or spoken about this to another person. Also, I'd like to note that my mom only explicitly asked me about the inappropriate touching after I had recalled everything about the event, so that couldn't have influenced my memory either. In short, if this truly was a false memory, I'm really unsure about how it could have been implanted in me.

137,yammuyammu,1613867115,"Hello, I've recently started trauma therapy to help me deal with sexual abuse in a past relationship. I've been through a lot of therapy and medication to deal with other things. Mostly related to my bipolar disorder. My trauma never really got dealt with because my mental health in general was so bad. Now I'm finally in therapy focused only on treating the effects of these specific traumatic events.

So, I expected this to be hard but I didn't realise it would involve recounting each experience over and over, then have my voice recorded and having to listen to that recording once a day until the next session. And then recount the next event and record/listen to that.

I've understood that the point is to sort of re-break a bone that didn't heal right so that it can heal properly or like opening a festered wound to drain the poison from it. It sure feels that way. 

My question is if anyone here has gotten the same kind of ""homework"" of listening to recordings like this? I've read that it's a common part of this type of therapy but I couldn't find any actual patients talking about it, only medical texts.

If you've had to do this, how did you go about doing it? Like, what time of the day, did you do anything else while listening or did you let it take all your focus? 

I listened to my first recording for the first time today and I knew I wouldn't be able to keep from harming myself if I didn't stay occupied somehow. So I had a writing pad and pencils and while I listened I just focused really hard on filling the entire paper with black. During the worst bits I scribbled really hard to ""get it out"" sort of. It's a tactic I learned in ERGT to keep my hand too busy to do bad things. Afterwards I played Stardew Valley to escape (I had planned beforehand what I would do after so I wouldn't end up in a bad place) 

All in all the first time went better than I expected. It was awful and painful but I didn't freak out as much as I feared. Today was a saturday though and I'm scared for the weekdays when I'll have less energy and time for aftercare.

This might be a very specific question. I don't know how common this even is but I would love to hear other experiences of this treatment method and how it went.

This is my first post here. Today is being a tough day for me.

I feel anxious, paralyzed and with a big discomfort on my stomach, every time I start really liking someone (on a romantic level) and the person seems distant or ignoring me. I get really angry and crazy when the person is online the entire day, but takes hours and hours to reply me. It should just bother me instead of paralyzing me and preventing me from doing my tasks and living my life.

Some years ago, the pressure/pain on my belly was so strong that I almost throw up my lunch. I usually end up early all of my relationships because the anxiety/discomfort keeps growing and after a certain point I just can't take it anymore. It's really hard for me to feel loved or safe. 

I am not sure if I have some form PTSD, but I'm sure I have anxious/ambivalent attachment style.

144,Icy-Lengthiness-5953,1613848590,"I have some things inside that often cause me stress/ anxiety and give me little dips in and out of  depression.

My mother was a prostitute and my father was a super rich business man when they met. I don’t know much else as there is a lot of secrecy, never brought this up with my father. I don’t know if I was an accident or not but either way I was definitely loved by both my parents although they split when I was 2 years old and my father got custody of me. 

They are both from two different continents and due to this I was raised out of South America ( my mums country) and in Europe causing me to not have much contact with my SA side of the family. My dad is a business man and spent my childhood taking me with him around the world but we never ever spent time with his family ( also a painful topic for him as he doesn’t speak much of it , his parents passed away before my birth and his sister has intense mental disorders) so I feel like an orphan. An adult orphan with no support. I have no siblings.

I do have contact to my mother and she tries hard to upkeep the relationship although does not have a base, she works in fashion now and often travels for work. We are very different. She and my dad are on good terms although he is now in his 70s, getting older which causes me a lot of anxiety as he is the only family I have ever known. Without him nowhere would feel like home.

Both my parents come from significantly different income brackets and the SA family faces a lot of hardships due to systematic problems in the country. 
I have a cousin who was in jail for armed robbery, my aunt was sexually abused as a child and her current husband has now just gone into jail for association with gangster groups , identity fraud and several other charges. They are also lost case religious die hards, normal in high poverty areas in that country in SA. This pushes us further apart.

They know my father has money and probably no one would do anything to me but I feel deeply scared to be in that country and be associated with them at all. Not everyone in the SA family is bad but I have had to distance myself mentally and physically because we have nothing to do with eachother and are basically estranged. Europe is safer for me. People assume I come from a wealthy background but do not know the dark side of my family. I try to have sympathy and understand them but have realized that being in that country and feel like an orphan surrounded by people that are supposed to be family would do me more bad than good.

I have just recently met my boyfriends family they come from a mid - upper class background are all very well educated and he seems to have had a healthy non traumatic childhood filled with love and attention and also a good support network around him. 

I feel sad for not being able to introduce him to anyone as I’m embarrassed of the SA family and have no relationship with them. My father will pass away one day he is already 77 and he is the light of my world and am very proud of him and would like them to meet soon when the time is right so he at least sees some good part of the family. Once he is gone I will consider myself an orphaned adult at 25 years of age.

I feel scared to tell my boyfriend about my traumas because I’m scared he will judge me about my mothers past profession, something she did out of necessity but brings me so much shame. I’m scared that he will think I have too much baggage and am unlovable or crazy because of my fucked up background ( which I had no control over). I’m scared he will view me as more needy and see me in a different light once I tell him these things. I also don’t want him to feel sorry for me and view me as weak. 

Overall my mental health is ok but I have dips where I think about this inter generational trauma and sometimes I feel deeply alone, despite my good friendships. I have enough resources and financial privilege to life a healthy life and do whatever I want anywhere but my past/ my family’s past sometimes gets me down and I go into a little depressive hole. 

Should I reveal this to him? This is my ultimate vulnerability. We have been together for 7 months. How do I say it? I feel like I must tell him in order for him to truly understand who I am and how strong I have to be everyday.

I restarted my life and I am in a good place. But the safer I got here, more of my ptsd began to show. After living here 2 years, I finally began to trust my family doctor enough to get some help and try medication. 

However the medication that my pcp prescribed wasn’t enough for the massive amount of trauma I have been through. My pcp recommended a psychiatrist and a EMDR/Trauma therapist who are both excellent. I started EMDR and new meds. I have had even worse symptoms from the therapy and new medications. My sleep over the last two weeks kept getting less and less until I didn’t sleep for three days. I started hallucinating about trauma I have been through. It was the definition of hell. 

I talked to both my therapist and psychiatrist. My therapist has paused EMDR therapy and we are doing regular talk therapy. My psychiatrist has changed/increased my medications. My psychiatrist is working on getting my medications right so I won’t have these episodes. I am meeting with both of them weekly to talk about. I think we are on the right path but it takes time. I’m patient about that. My psychiatrist is trying so hard to find a good mixture on strength of medication. We’ve even used genetic testing and it’s been helpful. Because of the genetic testing, I told my sister about it. She’s still living with my abusive dad who believes that psychology is a fake science. But her OCD has gotten so bad, that my mom begged her to go and see someone. We all have kept it a secret from my dad. I sent my sister my genetic testing and what medications I am currently on for my sisters psychiatrist. 

Well my sisters psychiatrist told her that my Quetiapine, which is used for emergency insomnia moments, is like an opiate. Since we live in a hot spot for the heroin epidemic, my sister was freaking out and talked to my mom about what her psychiatrist told her. They both called to confront me last night about it and asked if I could substitute all my sleeping medications for melatonin. 

I told them that after sleeping only 2-3 hours for two weeks and then followed by three days of no sleep, I think I am passed the point of what melatonin can do. Plus, it was my understanding that Quetiapine is an antipsychotic which is probably beneficial since I hallucinate in my lack of sleep episodes and those hallucinations are always events from my trauma. This most recent episode I was water boarded, shot, and assaulted all over again. It was emotionally exhausting.

I don’t know what to do about my mom and sister’s concerns. My mom won’t talk about my ptsd events if it involved what happened in my family.

So today I read an article that trauma alters how we receive love and it can lead to anger and agitation if someone shows care/love/attention to us. I never realised that it was because of PTSD. Here's a few excerpts from the articles ive read:

Difficulty receiving attention or care
Being witnessed can bring up tons of shame and guilt from the past. Make you feel exposed. Gifts and kind gestures can feel like traps. Receiving can feel awful because it always came with a contract, demand, or only following a punishment.
( https://medium.com/change-your-mind/childhood-trauma-makes-love-difficult-d69bbf8c6e89) 

1. Being loved arouses anxiety because it threatens long-standing psychological defenses formed early in life in relation to emotional pain and rejection, therefore leaving a person feeling more vulnerable
Although the experience of being chosen and especially valued is exciting and can bring happiness and fulfillment, at the same time, it can be frightening and the fear often translates into anger and hostility. Basically, love is scary when it contrasts with childhood trauma. In that situation, the beloved feels compelled to act in ways that hurt the lover: behaving in a punitive manner, distancing themselves and pushing love away.  In essence, people maintain the defensive posture that they formed early in life. Because the negative reaction to positive events occurs without conscious awareness, individuals respond without understanding what caused them to react. They rationalize the situation by finding fault with or blaming others, particularly those closest to them.

2. Being loved arouses sadness and painful feelings from the past.
Being treated with love and tenderness arouses a kind of poignant sadness that many people struggle to block out. Ironically, close moments with a partner can activate memories of painful childhood experiences, fears of abandonment and feelings of loneliness from the past. People are afraid of being hurt in the same ways they were hurt as children.

3. Being loved provokes a painful identity crisis
When people have been hurt, they feel that if they accepted love into their life, the whole world as they have experienced it would be shattered and they would not know who they were. Being valued or seen in a positive light is confusing because it conflicts with the negative self-concept that many people form within their family.

156,No_Anywhere6824,1613805368,"I’m not 100% sure if I have PTSD but here’s my story and I’d like opinions on if you think I may have it and/or and coping mechanisms to put my symptoms to ease in any way. 

Me and my ex were together for four years and the last year of our relationship it got bad. There were incidences where he’d put his hands on me physically and was verbally abusive while angry. One night while angry he broke the door off the hinges and was threatening me and I thought I heard him cock his gun a few times(he denied) but I know what I heard. 

Given these incidents happening, I felt extreme tension when around him and nervous about what he may do to me. When we broke up and he moved out, while trying to go to sleep I’d hear phantom knocks on my front door and get panicky and feel like he’s coming to attack me. It got better over time but the other day he kicked my front door in and tried to get to me to attack me so I was able to call the police and had him arrested. 

Those panicky feelings and phantom knocks have started again but now I get nervous and panicky/anxiety ridden when I hear someone coming up the steps or any noise for that matter esp at night.

• Would “forgive” my mistakes, only to use them against me later and call me names.

• Body shaming me, would tell me I needed a better chest and needed to go on medicine for my weight so I could gain weight ( I’m very insecure on my weight and he knew this!) but when I made even a joke that he started he’d get mad and blame me for it.

• Wouldn’t listen to me when other girls would make me uncomfortable due to their flirtiness with him, wouldn’t post me or really make any points to show he was with me. 

• Would force me to lose sleep due to him threatening suicide or a breakup, taking advantage of my attachment issues

• Would randomly say I was cheating on him even if I wasn’t around anyone else, usually was riding my horse or at a therapy meeting.

• Left me for someone else and completely lied about it. 

• After leaving me, knowing very well he triggered my depression, self harm and starving myself, he continued to manipulate me, lead me on and message me to help him with his emotions

• Got mad at me for healing and moving on and dating someone who treats me better.

I want to say right off the bat that I'm not diagnosed with PTSD and I'm not trying to diagnose myself. I've contacted my college counselor so we'll see where that goes.

I do have a lot of symptoms though. I was in a bad car accident about 1.5 years ago. A lot of my depression symptoms worsened afterwards (insomnia, rumination, negative thought cycles, etc). I still get accident related nightmares, in fact I just had one last night (and I'm someone who used to never, ever get nightmares). I think back to several incidents since the accident, I didn't understand it at the time but I now think they might've been flashbacks (when this happens I'm still aware of my surroundings, I'm aware that I'm not actually physically back in the accident, but emotionally I get snapped back there, and the thoughts/memories are very intrusive, it feels like a movie playing on repeat in my head that I can't shut off. It can happen from seemingly small things like a scene in a movie I'm watching).

 I have a ton of driving anxiety, and had to pull to the side of the road when I got a panic attack after a guy came into my lane without looking and almost hit me. My boyfriend lives in downtown of a big city, and I've only managed to get up the courage to drive there once. I was so stressed by the time I got there that we spent an hour just doing relaxing/grounding things, he put on ambience sounds, gave me a massage, guided me through breathing exercises, and gave me the rock he uses to ground himself (huge shoutout to my bf btw, he's amazing).

I honestly was in full denial about how much this accident has affected me until a few months ago when my boyfriend started pointing some things out to me. He has PTSD from his time in the army so I think he probably recognized some symptoms. Here's my issue: He's trying to guide me toward healing, and I really appreciate that, but sometimes it feels too fast. He's always tried to give me space around it and accepted if I didn't wanna talk about it, but he wants me to go to trauma therapy, and group, and to journal whenever I have a nightmare or I'm triggered in some way. I get it, all these things are good but I don't feel ready, and it feels like too much too fast. But I'm sure no one actually feels ""ready"" to dive into these kinds of things. I guess I just don't know if I need to talk to my bf and keep taking it slow, or if I need to gather up my courage and start thinking about the hard stuff instead of avoiding it.

173,Hippy-lesbian,1613767674,"TW: sexual assault, grooming, narcissistic abuse

I grew up in a narcissistic household that didn’t allow me to express my own needs. Consequently, until recently, I lost touch with my individuality.

My senior year I was sexually assaulted and raped by 7 people. I never processed it normally. Instead, since I already only lived to please others, I let them live their lives and didn’t tell the police. I mentally detached myself from my body because clearly it didn’t belong to me anymore. It was so easy for those guys to have it, (and yes I said no, but they’re all bigger than me! I’m so tiny, only 107 pounds.)

So then, a year ago I was in a relationship with a guy a bit older. I was 18. He roofied me, raped me, belittled me beyond belief, gaslighted me, bruised me, would hurt me so bad I was hospitalized with an infection. I can’t go too into detail because it’s so gross, but yeah. Very not good.  While I was there, he ghosted me for two days. And got mad that another dude that I was just friends with picked me up from the hospital. Well was I just supposed to wait for him to stop ghosting me and stay there until I got a ride?? He would also try to convince me that I hated myself so much I was crazy and needed long term care. (Despite all of this trauma, I function quite well in society. I’ve kept work and school just fine.) He would say we would both probably kill ourselves if we broke up but the next day would go out and cheat on me and say he can’t be contained by a person. But he wouldn’t let me leave. He would compliment me so much it wasn’t genuine at all. He was way more poor than me but would insist on buying me stuff. He moved in with his ex and still tried to convince me they weren’t together and that him and I still were. He kept me drugged all the time. I’m so much of a people pleaser that if saying no the first couple times didn’t work, I’d just go with it. Things got too bad, and I blocked him. The few friends I’ve told don’t give a shit. Everyone tells me this is normal or it’s my fault.

It’s been over a year. During this time, I got on antidepressants, been in therapy, started a much healthier diet, do daily yoga and mediation, had a spiritual awakening, etc. in this process, I’ve become much more mindful, but in doing so, I feel so disgusting and violated. I now know my rights and how they were taken. The PTSD is so much worse now, and it was already hell before. Now that I’ve processed it was all fake and just grooming, I feel so stupid!! I’m finding it so hard to not feel like a crazy person. My emotions hit me so inconveniently. It’s so hard to function. The nightmares and flashbacks are eating me alive.

190,roanokethrope,1613721261,"i do apologize in advance for the rather vague title of this post, however i will be going more in depth here. again, i apologize if it possibly isn’t relevant, i’ve just never been very open about these experiences before

for context, it has been largely suspected for a good year or so that i suffer from ptsd. i say suspected as i’ve never been outright told per say by my therapist, yet he’s been consistently mentioning “my ptsd”, as he phrases it, for a good year or so. but anyways, part of where i struggle is rather intense paranoia; at times its subtle and not too difficult to manage, most of the time however it’s to the point where i can’t bring myself to talk to people without believing they have ill intent. on the occasion it does bring on panic attacks, though i digress

where my question comes in is with an experience i’ve been having i believe following the trauma and abuse that i have gone through. there will be moments i wake up in the near middle of the night or very early in the morning and am almost totally paralyzed with fear that there is something in my room watching me. i feel sometimes i can genuinely make out the shape of a figure standing in the corner of my room or crouched right before my couch bed. said believed figure will then completely disappear following getting enough courage to turn on my phone’s flashlight, so i at least in the moment can recognize that it was all a figment of my conscious, though the trouble doesn’t stop there

i honestly find it very difficult to be able to navigate the house without a light kept on my person following establishing these figures aren’t really there. the light helps establish there is no figure in the house, but i’m consistently on edge about what my light isn’t illuminating and what figure could potentially come to harm me that i can’t see. most of the time i want to make a mad dash back upstairs, lock my bedroom door and essentially wait until sunrise to chill out, though i have forced myself to not race to the top of the stairwell on numerous occasions

sometimes it also extends to what i’m hearing, where i totally and utterly convince myself someone has to be in my house. at times i sit there paralyzed with fear, knowing its illogical that someone would be in the house but then being unable to convince myself otherwise. i’ve had numerous occasions where it’s just my mother coming to open my room door to say good morning to me, yet i’ll literally physically prepare myself for the worst case scenario

i can easily sit there for 10-15 minutes plus if this begins happening, sometimes 20 from what i’ve been able to recollect. i cant look at my phone as i worry these figures would get me if my attention gets diverted in any way, shape or form, and i can’t really call for help as it’s just all mind games i suppose. sometimes even after i do lock my door this doesn’t go away; again, i can easily sit there for a good 10-15 minutes just totally and utterly losing it in silence

i’ve never really talked about these experiences before,, but i’d be really appreciative if anyone has any advice on what this may be or anything really. obviously, i should mention it to my therapist when possible, though inevitably i worry ill be told somethings very wrong and that i’ll need more medication. so, really, any advice would be great right now",ptsd,does anyone else experience this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lnacpg/does_anyone_else_experience_this/,1613692461.0

She basically said to set up an appointment, and to ask for a specific doctor. 
I'm nervous about it. The last time I had the opportunity to get medication for my anxiety, I said no bc I was afraid of how it might make me feel. Would I end up feeling like a zombie? But, my mom basically said that if the doctor was good, we'd find something that works for me personally..
I'm still having anxious jitters, but its not as bad. Something I am worried about is what to say when they ask what the issue is.

This post may have triggering descriptions in it, I’ll put a CW ahead of the description of the piece bc it may be graphic.

My design for the piece involves a cast of two hands being pulled together around the wrists &amp; upper forearm by fishing line. In between these two hands’ palms will be a bundle of fish hooks and sharp metal/objects piercing the skin. The fishing line will be wrapped and tied into the fish hooks and around the hands so that it gives the effect of the hands being locked together by force from the lining and fish hooks pull.

I’ve been in a codependency treatment program for several months now, and am realizing my partner and I are both codependent. Can healing actually happen in a codependent relationship? I know it involves both parties being willing to work on it. 

Mostly my concern is that I feel that my partner constantly blames me for issues in our marriage. We have kids together and it isn’t as easy to detach because of this, but I also don’t want my kids to grow up in a dysfunctional home like I did. 

It just feels that I keep getting put in the scapegoat role, and I do not respond well to that. That is eerily similar to the home I grew up in, and it is a major trigger for me with episodes. I can’t even confront them about their behavior because the gaslighting from my childhood and in my current relationship is so bad that I often question my own truth and experiences.

Just it’s been getting worse day by day and week by week so I’ll probably have to go do something about it and was wondering how I’d get a diagnosis. 

What I don’t want though is the person who did things to me to be brought into my life, that would be so awful. 

My mom is also weird so she’d probably bring them over and make them apologize or do something with me. That’s just me being paranoid. 

Also I mainly think I have ptsd because, when my mom touches me (non inappropriately) I feel sick and my mind starts racing and I feel like I’m gonna die, I can’t concentrate and feel like my heads constantly fogged up, I’m always scared someone is going to hurt me, when I think of the events I get head aches and will usually almost throw up, I’m always paranoid as hell, I used to be an alchoholic and a couple other things.

(Also please don’t say “you don’t talk like a 13 yr old”. Just because I didn’t say “ayo any of ya foos tryna help my head ass like ya cut G lookin ass get a ptsd diagnosis??” doesn’t mean I’m lieing.)

218,writingonthewall87,1613671257,"I’m a female in my 30’s. 
I have a diagnosis of PTSD (I suspect autism as well) after seeing a counselor who works with people who suffer from Trauma but she does NOT specialize in Autism and has a very ableist view on ASD. 
She told me trauma and autism symptoms are too similar but she thinks I’m not autistic because I can finish tasks and I have an artistic talent where I’m able to finish an art piece. Autistic couldn’t do those things, according to her. She claimed autistics avoid certain situations completely. So she is very uneducated.

My trauma occurred in my childhood from being in a war. First I got extremely traumatized by a jet that flew right over my house while I was outside. Then months after I got locked in a child care facility and I injured both arms with cuts by breaking the glass doors to escape.

This is about 30 years ago. I ‘outgrew’ the symptoms like nightmares and mutism before my teenage years. 

But I spent my whole life a loner, selective mutism, couldn’t show affection. Didn’t fit in groups. Hated any out of the ordinary events at school and team building. 
I was a day dreamer. Imagined relationships. Spent a lot of time drawing.

But I still struggle with things that make me believe I could be on the autism spectrum and therefore had such a harsh traumatic response to a noise of a jet. Especially after my daughter got diagnosed with Autism. I started research and could relate. I didn’t know anything about Autism before that so I never bothered to find a reason for why I am the way I am. My parents never discussed mental health. But my father displays autistic traits as well.

I’m looking for some advice and I would like to know if someone who has been exclusively diagnosed with PTSD or C-PTSD can relate to my traits/symptoms.

I can’t call my husband by his first name. Not once in 16 years. I can’t call my parents mom and dad. I can’t call my husbands parents by name or make proper eye contact. This weighs heavily on me.
There’s a couple words I don’t say say in front of my husband. Weird, I know.

I feel uncomfortable returning hugs and never initiate them.
I can’t show affection. 
Uncomfortable about eye contact.
Family gatherings or any change in my daily routine gives me extreme anxiety. I can’t eat, I shake and get headaches. 

I have no friends. Don’t do small talk well. I can’t always read if I’m welcomed. If someone is tired, annoyed or upset.

My special interest I had since early childhood I get a lot of positive feedback for but it causes often distress due to my perfectionism issues. When I have to finish something I forget time, my basic needs and that’s very draining at times. I put my all into it. Very detail oriented. I’ve always had one narrow specific subject.

I have no career even though I wasn’t a bad student. Got laid off for being too slow and in my thoughts. Bad at verbal commands.

I am very sensitive to bright lights, loud noises like tv and everyone talking at once. And severe aversions to synthetic smells.

I always overthink, second guess, remorse over everything and can’t let things go. I am bad at regulating my emotions.

I have a lot of fears still like worries about my kids. I am shocked easily and all that. So I do have ptsd, no doubt. 
But all these other issues. Not looking for a diagnosis here. But are those all common PTSD problems? 

Also I am generally a happy person despite all those problems I have. I am happily married and have amazing children. My second born was diagnosed with Autism at the age of 2.
So, do people who suffer from PTSD live a fairly relaxed and happy life or are you completely alert and on your toes all the time?

219,lovetrial,1613670897,"I'm 24 and have never been in a relationship.

This isn't because I'm super ugly or smell like shit or anything like that. I'm not saying this to humble brag or anything, it's just a disclaimer; I do get called attractive very often by many different people. I get comments in elevators that I smell good because of my lotion. I get asked on dates often enough because I have a lot of hobbies and even though I can be weird, there are a lot of people who are weird, so it's fine.

On all of those accounts, there's nothing wrong with me.

But I've never held hands with another person before, much less kissed someone I liked. Sex is very much out of the question. 

My roommate layed down near me the other day and I started to cry uncontrollably. If someone accidentally brushes my waist or below I nearly fall to the ground from how much I jerk away. Seeing wine glasses and beer bottles at the store is enough to make me feel like I'm going to throw up, and hearing someone talk about alcohol is enough to ruin my week. If someone says they've been to a party before, I become completely unable to trust them, so I end up ghosting.

I understand why I end up alone no matter how many times I try to reach out to others. I let my fear control me. My fear of being touched means that I don't want to stand anywhere near other people, and my fear of being hurt means that I won't listen to people talk unless I'm absolutely certain that they won't talk about alcohol.

As I am now, I'm incompatible with other people. So I should change it, right? I should stop being adverse to touch, and I should stop getting scared at the mere mention of drinking. But everytime I try, I'm so scared that I can't handle it. I end up withdrawing and being too scared to interact with others for months at a time.

I take a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant, and they help a ton with feeling too depressed to function and doing impulsive things, but they don't cure the root of fear. I've tried therapy, but even if they point out how bad my coping mechanisms are, I can't seem to force myself to abandon them.

If I let other people touch me, I will be hurt. If I let other people drink around me, they will hurt me. These are ideas that I can't seem to get rid of no matter how much I want to interact with others. I really do want to get married. It's my number one dream. So why can't I get rid of this fear? I can't even get attracted to other people. I haven't been able to since I was 12 and all of this started. I've not liked anyone since then at all. Nobody is attractive to me. I feel nothing when they talk to me.

Has anyone found their way out of this kind of attitude/situation? I'm sabotaging my ability to be happy, but I just don't know how to change. Even when I try, I get so scared that I come right back to where it's safe. Is there some other medication or type of therapy? I doubt that there's a magic bullet or anything, but as things are, I just feel so resigned. I want to be happy, but I can't be. I don't want to live in fear, but I don't want to get hurt.

Now, since this year I’m having graphic nightmares of crime scenes. And me or the representation of me or my subconscious screaming my head off.

I used to have nightmares every night. I haven't had nightmares nor stressful dreams recently. I have had a couple of weird ones. 

Is it harmful to try to interpret my dreams? Whenver I brought them up to a counselor they didn't want to delve into it. 

Maybe it's a thing I learned as a child. I always wanted to find meaning in my dreams. I'm not mystical(or maybe these counts) nor religious. Maybe it's a coping mechanism to find answers I don't have. 

I'm not sure if I'm scared or why  I do these things. I know the brain is powerful at interpretation and making 'patterns' out of things, but sometimes my dreams feel like they're trying to find answers I don't have. 

Some good examples are when my friend died in middle school I dreamt I saw him and said goodbye. Dreaming of my grandpa-who passed away unexpectantly, but never seeing his face.  

The bad is another time I kept having dreams about talking to a friend and seeing their face, but then I would notice we were having sex. This is the friend who later raped me.

234,Ziz1971,1613624592,"My short bio: I’m a 48-yo woman. My family growing up was great, luckily no real issues there. At some point in my childhood (6-8 years) I was molested by an older child (12-14.) I don’t  have a clear memory of this, and mostly just know from his 12-step confession/apology letter- that caused a visceral reaction but details are still fuzzy. I was also flashed by a naked man, and had other “weirdness” but nothing I really recall clearly. 

Fast forward to my adult life where I worked in mental health. I was repeatedly put in frightening situations where I witnessed physical assaults, was physically assaulted myself, and never felt safe. I’m still in “the field” but work in an admin function now. 

In 2007 I worked in a dangerous setting and witnessed multiple severe physical assaults on my coworkers, which involved trips to the Er, head trauma, a broken nose, and (the incident that made me quit) spinal trauma. Then a series of events happened:
2010 I witnessed a friend suffer a massive heart attack and die in front of me. 
2011 I witnessed a fatal motorcycle accident. I was stopped in traffic an a guy rear ended the car next to/in front of me (so the motorcycle was right next to me) at full speed. 
2012 A co-worker suffered a massive heart attack in front of me. Died at the hospital. 
2013 A good friend disappeared. I was involved in the search. She was found 24 hours later dead- she had drowned in her car after an accident. 
2014 my mother fell and broke her hip- she was my disabled father’s primary care taker. She quickly developed dementia after that. 
2015-2019 Caring for my father and mother- I had to call 911 more times than I can remember. Falls, 2am calls from the police department, strokes, etc. 
2019 my father died- I was holding his hand in hospice
2020:
One of my long-time friends died
My cat died
My mother died
My husband’s aunt died
I had major spine surgery
My doctor of 15 years died 
My father in law was diagnosed with leukemia
I work in mental health still and we have averaged one death a week for a while now. 
2021 Two weeks ago my husband had a reaction to tree nuts and went into anaphylactic shock. I thought he was going to die. Called 911 and he was taken to the Er while I sat at home because of Covid... 

So I have had 10+ years of high stress, frightening events happening to me or around me. I have been increasingly detached, angry, and callous. Sometimes I think I’m catastrophizing, but since my husband’s allergic reaction I find myself losing time, staring off into space for hours, and being numb.

235,Micah912,1613623492,"To the best of my ability , I will try to summarize my upbringing, trauma, and mental health experiences. I am 24 years of age, male, and a college student. I was born overseas on an army airfield base in Wurzburg, Germany; I am Black and Korean. I moved to NJ and I grew up as an only child and was raised by my grandparents, mother, and aunt. My grandmother is originally from South Korea while my grandfather is black and originally from Louisiana. My father (maternal) was absent all my childhood for various ""unknown"" reasons. Until recently, I heard through my half-brother in New York, he's had a history of broken marriages as well as verbal/physical abuse. For the most part, my childhood was positive. As far as my socio-economic class, I come from an average and lower middle class family. My mother commuted to New York daily while my grandparents took care of me. I was extremely close to my grandfather and because of his military experience, he encouraged and exposed me to traveling the world at a young age. In my neighborhood, school, and town; however, I was practically a social outcast and I was bullied severely because of my cultural/racial differences and the fact I was extremely quiet. I know it's a cliche, but my experiences were from it and their scars both physically and verbally had traumatized me to this day. For instance, occasionally I would have to escape to the bathroom for lunch so I could avoid people judging me eat Korean food. My story was far from typical and there was no point of reference or alternative culture I could turn to. I was an outcast to all the outcasts in my town and school because my cultural identity was so unique and my personality was so odd. I had also suffered from a number of learning disorders and I struggled in school and I was forced into smaller resource classrooms with the same group of kids from elementary school to high school. It was painfully exhausting and monotonous and I never received proper help or treatment and I am not playing the victim or race card, my experiences were deeply rooted in my identity and things I had no control over. Typically, you hear similar stories like mine broadcasted in famous literature, films, and television series classic troubled loner, but it's almost always the white boy. I hate to be that way but I am being honest, none of my experiences of being an outcast were superficial or cool or it was deeply complex and very very isolating and insular. Fast forward, I was expelled from middle school for brining a knife twice to school. I had no intentions to murder anyone but I will be honest do not judge me, I was sincerely angry about it and I wanted to protect myself from the bullies I experienced at school. However, the school misdiagnosed me with with a number of disorders like aspergers and I was arrested and I am not going to explain in depth what happened and who was involved just a lot kids bullying me and being surrounded by two-faced manipulative friends, but it led to an immense misundestanding. Peers perceived me and joked that I was classic serial killer or whatever loner type and I was far from that. My truth was overturned by stereotypes, racist, negative remarks, and hyper-exaggerations.

Moving on, high school was well alienating and I practically had no one to turn to until my final year where I met my best friend who helped. He was also extremely alienated and he exposed to different forms of music/art like My Bloody Valentine, Jean-Michel-Basquait, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, Can, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, Deerhunter, and Animal Collective. We made music as a passion and we both were the only ones in our town that listen to this music. This is not important in the whole context of who I am, but it is still important to address. Anyway moving to college, was not better people often say that to people like me. I was extremely sheltered my entire adolescence I was not part of any group in school any group whatsoever and I was so sheltered and involved in my own world of my music, writing, and my problems that I was so detached from the beginnings of social media and internet culture that reigned all my adolescence. I had no experience of it and I still don't really understand social media or meme culture or this new vernacular, I was not involved in anything NOTHING. This caused me to live in a cloud of deep disassociation from my peers for years. College was extremely traumatizing this marked the beginning of endless spiral to bottomless sea four years and currently now. I withdrew from college my second year to be brief I went to school in New York. Sometimes I slept on the street and roamed on subways for hours and never returned to class. My roommate alienated me my second year and I was forced to sleep in the basement of my dorm sometimes. I also had panic attacks in public in the city and I can just say I rolled in the middle of a busy street and screamed helplessly for someone to help me and car almost ran over my head. That's how bad it was. I can name more darker experiences where I broke windows in the city too and attacked cars. I was forced on a medical leave of absence. Since the year of 2016 I have struggled immensely and I had return to my hometown and I have basically been there since for the most part. I have been in a long distance relationships and I have knew someone who died to heroin in this town. I hate it there everyhting has been fueled by negative experienences. My mother also got married and forced me to live with my step dad in a new home. I am torn between both places and I am also just feeling deeply alienated and since home I did some of those things in New York back in my hometown. thankfully though the only positive elements have come through therapy and passing and failing community college multiple times. I also had traumatic experiences during two summers in two different states where I interned. The most vivid expeirence I had was when I was slept in the fields of Iowa and behind a church in the middle of nowhere at night. I was feeling so disassociated I just escaped I had put on makeup and romaed on the highway drunk as fuck and I failed my summer internship. A lot other shit has happened too. Thankfully though, I finally got accepted to a college and on my way to get a degree but it's terrible to know how much has happened to me and where I am now.",ptsd,"Extreme Outcast and Ostracized In Every Possible With A Lifetime Consumed With Trauma, NO MEMES or CLICHES HERE ONLY THE TRUTH",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lmdzex/extreme_outcast_and_ostracized_in_every_possible/,1613594692.0

Had zero help from my environment with the ptsd and trauma. For years, I was isolated just doing a 3rd shift job and struggling to regain some basic mental abilities. At year 5/6, things started to get better for me. I lost almost 200lbs in a year, was finishing up my schooling, saved up some money, etc. Year 7/8 unlocked all the abuse I tried to keep locked up and totally messed me up in a different way. The first group of people I met after practically 7 years of social isolation, they backstabbed me at my most vulnerable point and ended up making my life even worse. They robbed what little freedom I had and progress I made. 

Currently, I'm trying to relax from the maelstrom others have made for me. I'm focused on maintaining a routine. But I'm struggling to find any self-respect. I realize I can do so much by myself, especially with my diminished mental abilities. But the problem is that the first group of people I made the mistake of trusting, they did so much harm to me. I need advice on how to overcome the negative effects that this group of people had on me. How can I do it when I'm in the same environment and worse off?

It’s only been a month so I don’t know if it’s considered ptsd but I’m just starting to deal with what happened now, I think. I hit a another vehicle almost head on going about 120kmh. 

I’m 17 years old and I have heard of the term being depressed before but never really understood it. I broke both of my legs, my left wrist, all fingers, collar bone injury, grade 3 spleen laceration, liver laceration, lung punctures both sides, broke my left hip, and multiple pelvis fractures, also a scrotal laceration. It’s supposed to be full recovery but I’m just in such a low place right now. I’m expecting charges as well. 

I want to die I think about the crash hours on end. It replays in my mind. Sitting there with all my bones poking out of skin. I’m not very good at writing so excuse my sentence structure. Any tips from anyone who’s been thru something traumatic like this. 

I’m stuck in a bed and have been in hospital for a month. I have had issues with addiction in the past therefore I’m just taking Tylenol. No narcotics. I tried to smoke weed for the first night back home yesterday and I had the worst pannick attack of my life. Reliving that same moment of the crash. I’ve been using weed daily for about 2 years smoking around 3-4 grams a day. 

I keep saying to myself I’m lucky to be here everyday but I’m in pain mentally. I have panick attacks around 2-3 times a day lasting around 2-3 hours each. Shaking, nausea, almost feel manic like and I just lose my mind. I don’t feel like myself. I just hoping things can get better.

240,slangle,1613617564,"TLDR: Recently diagnosed, looking for good recommendations for coping with nightly anxiety. 

I (26F) was recently diagnosed with PTSD. My trauma stems from a medical condition that my husband has suffered with for the last two years. In the last couple of months, we have been able to get a diagnosis for him along with a really effective treatment. In my head it feels that this should cure all my problems, but alas, it does not.

In the last few days I have been struggling what feels like excessively. I had a few good weeks where my symptoms were very minimal. But as of right now, at night, I start to feel overly anxious. I spend the majority of my evenings on edge and frustrated. I'm snappy and overall really don't feel like myself. I'm waking up in the middle of the night having a panic attack and not being able to go back to sleep. I journal every night before bed and do about 20 minutes of self guided meditation. I have tried going outside during a panic attack to the cold to help me ""snap out of it"" to no avail. Has anyone struggled with the same thing? What are coping skills that have helped you in the situation? At this point I'm open to anything as these nights are really starting to take a toll on me.

Please bear with me, this is incredibly hard to write and even harder to think about. 

I am a mother of two wonderful and amazing children who are the sunshine of my life. I thank God for them everyday. Even writing that makes me cry and evokes such emotion I can’t even describe. But years ago our family was rocked to the core.

So background, my partners family is very overbearing and I had basically invested most of our lives with his family, to the detriment of my own as my partners mother was poorly. This caused me tremendous stress trying to ‘fit in’. I had been doing this for over ten years at this point.

Then a few years ago we discovered that my partners, sisters husband was a convicted child abuser. As you can imagine this destroyed and tore our family apart. 


My partner and I immediately ceased all contact with both the husband and his sister. Unfortunately other members of the family (with children) continued to share their lives with them, even holidaying with them! 

This created huge problems in our family and we became angry with these family members and although we still talk the relationship is permanently damaged.

After receiving this news we were told by other family members that we needed to keep it secret as my partners mum was terminally ill. 

I turned to my family for support. My children had spent a night at their house under their care. Their aunt knew his history and didn’t tell us. I was even apprehensive about them staying and was reassured by relatives it was safe. 

Let me stress, we do not believe anything happened to our children as much as we can be. But I will never forgive myself for this. I let a monster near my children. The reason I cannot forgive myself is that I had a bad feeling about this guy.

Now, I am a quiet person and very intuitive and empathic and usually able to ‘read’ people pretty well. I had a strange feeling about this guy from almost the moment he joined the family.

 I remember vividly an incident where I saw his ‘mask fall’. 
He didn’t realise I was watching him and his jovial persona dropped for just a moment and I had a glimpse of something that made me feel very uneasy but I didn’t know why. I told other family members this.

The problem was ongoing as there were signs he was grooming a child within the family and we were extremely worried and eventually he was caught doing smth online I think and arrested again. This was enough that the other family members finally ceased contact with him. 

I struggled with my guilt for having our children around this man. I couldn’t understand how his sister could stay with him? Did that make her dangerous too? Family members would talk about it and I told them I wanted no info about them, they were dead to me and I couldn’t cope with thinking about them.
For the most part, time passed and we were able to move on. 

I became quite ill with a few illnesses and was diagnosed with a chronic illness and was probably at my lowest ebb.

I was juggling working, kids, housework, my health etc and had extended my hours so we made the decision to put our son in aftercare club at his school so I could work a full day for one day per week. 

Our son hated it and eventually told us that there was a woman who worked there who made him feel uncomfortable. He said she would stare at him and sit too close. 
We didn’t think it was something untoward  but reported it and removed him from aftercare. Then one morning walking into the school I saw her watching him myself and felt very strange about it. It worried me very much.

We had to continue to see her at the school and everytime we walked past my son would fall quiet and not look at her which scared the hell out of me. Although she had never touched my child ( he was never alone) smth she did made him feel very uncomfortable. And something was definitely not right. 

I won’t lie. This f@%^#ng destroyed me. 

My partner and I are very very protective parents. We have always controlled as best we could our children’s interactions with other people. They are not allowed social media (teen), we rarely share pics of them online and we would not even allow them to be photographed at school. We did everything we could to protect them! 

 But we had failed twice. Twice our children had fallen into the clutches of these monsters where they could have been hurt. I couldn’t deal with it. It sent me reeling. 

I had a dream about this woman from aftercare ,  (not a graphic dream) like she was asking a child to keep her abuse a secret. This dream was incredibly disturbing and was the tipping point for my mental health. 

Why did that horrendous dream happen?
I fell into a chronic deep depression. I couldn’t understand the dream, why would I dream that? Was something wrong with me? 

I couldn’t get the dream out of my head. So I started googling dreams like this etc and came across symptoms of intrusive thoughts. Reading these was even more traumatic. 

I then started to have intrusive thoughts and images about the awful things that could have happened to my children. I kept thinking about these monsters. All my worst fears were distorted in my mind. 

I was scared that strangers or even people on the tv were all child abusers. I became extremely scared and triggered of anything to do with news stories relating to abuse, rape, murder etc. I would have intrusive thoughts about self harm. 

I would feel such disgust, shame and trauma thinking this thoughts of abusers and self harm that I began to think something was very wrong with me? Was I now dangerous? 

My children began to trigger my anxiety and thoughts. I just didn’t want to be near them. I didn’t want to be near any child. 
It would start a chain of thoughts about what could have happened to them, that I failed them and I would become extremely anxious. I was always crying. I wanted to die. I have nightmares about it all, sudden noises scare me, certain words I can’t read or say, I’m always on edge, the memories of it all make me feel incredibly anxious and traumatises me all over again. 

I have found a therapist who believes I am dealing with the after affects of trauma. Like PTSD of the ‘incidences’. She thinks they are manifesting in many ways.

The crazy thing is NOTHING HAPPENED! Our kids were not hurt! The only thing that has changed is me. My Partner has accepted nothing happened. 

 The thoughts, images and fear were not real. They were imagined worst cases. I have made myself sick worrying about these god damn monsters out there, the evil that they do and traumatised myself. 

I have recently started to get better. I understand that the thoughts were distortions of my worst fears, I am managing my anxiety and triggers, I am feeling happier and exercising but I still have moments where those intrusive thoughts try to break through and my heart just dies all over again. 

I wish I could wipe my memory of all of this. I hate them so much for bringing this to our family. I can’t forgive myself for not protecting our children, I can’t deal with the thoughts when they get through and I just want to be the happy mum I used to be. My children deserve a mum who is present and engaged. I know I am getting better everyday but those sticky days are where I fall down. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How do I move past this. 

It’s not like a normal form of trauma or PTSD and I am so sorry if that offends anyone but I need my life back.

I have always had intense issues with intimacy and mistrust around men and often my family since i was very young. It isn’t just a general fear, but a jolt of tension through my body and a sudden feeling of sensation in my genitals that i have never been able to explain. Its almost like a terrible nausea and a “butterfly” sensation i can feel there.  
Recently, i took acid and ended up racking my brain about my issues with sex. I’ve always felt as if there is something deeply wrong. I’ve ruled out so many things over the years. 
My roommate was talking about an experience with a paediatrician she had as a child, and i had one of the most vivid, gut-wrenching flashbacks of an experience I had as a child, probably around 4 or 5 years old. 
****I’m just going to throw in another trigger warning****
I was having stomach issues, i guess constipation. 
My grandmother decided that medical intervention was necessary. I was brought to my pediatrician. My pants and underwear were removed and I was being held tightly, stomach down by her. A male doctor slid his finger in my rectum. This went on long enough for me to be kicking and screaming. 
After this experience, there were many instances of sexual fascination that i explored as a VERY young child. I think that experience literally changed me forever. I could never look at her the same way, even now as an adult. I have had intrusive thoughts about pedophilia, but i have absolutely no interest in children and want to have some of my own one day. It’s more of a looming, almost demonic emotional experience, like being able to imagine abuse from their perspective.
I had completely repressed this incident until it flooded my mind recently. It’s been so pervasive that i’ve been closing my eyes and shaking every time it comes to mind. I don’t really know where to go forward with this information. Can someone please give me some advice, like literally anything.

I moved away from my city where I had my support-network because of UNI in August. So I lost everything and have to start over again. The wait is so long.

In the beginning I was ""high on life"" I guess, so I started off okay. It felt amazing to walk the streets and not be worried about seeing your perpetrators. But it's been slowly creeping up on me again, that I still never feel safe.

I've been traumatised and retraumatized many times, and my brain shifts between these ""threats"". I worry about never being free, always followed and that I will get hurt again. Every Facebook notifications got me scared of my perpetrators contacting me. Even though they're blocked and I've changed my number.

This paranoia is driving me crazy. It's not realistic. Why would they come back 5 years later and hurt me. We're not related so there's no reason. But my mind believes I'm never safe.

I never thought that would be my diagnosis honestly, because I never found myself relating to anyone's PTSD stories. I struggle the most with derealization, so I was wondering if anyone experiences the same thing.

I can't recognize my face, my voice or body when looking at my hands or limbs. It seems like I'm staring at a stranger. Nothing feels real, everything feels like I'm living in a dream state. It forces me to completely separate myself from the moment or task I'm in, and I can't stop focusing on how much I don't feel real. This has caused me a lot of distress, and this is a daily battle as well. Some days are better but others feel like rock bottom. It feels like a shitty 2003 first person video game.

There's also a visual aspect to my derealization, it's like someone put a white filter over my vision or turned up the overexposure, and I get really bad tunnel vision and it's incredibly difficult to focus on things physically around me.

I have abandonment issues and I also have issues being stuck in one place for too long due to 2 different incidents. Being locked in a room and ignored then later being taken EVERYWHERE and not being allowed to see others. Both of these cause me to become verbally aggressive to my friends if they repeatedly refuse to talk to me despite my efforts to work around their schedules. On the flip side of that. I had surgery last year and some friends housed me for my recovery. Due to weather conditions and everything being closed we couldn't go out and do stuff during any of it. I also ended up there for longer than planned. Now the friend never wants to be near me in person again. They say it's fine in social events with mutual friends but they'd prefer I keep my distance. I was not physical despite how that sounds. And they still talk to me over text and such. They just do not want to be near me because they believe I will never change.

250,Gh0stWr1terTrixie,1613593216,"My PTSD symptoms generally consist of hypervigilance, panic and anxiety attacks, avoidance and dissociation, sleep disturbances, and flashbacks, both situations that remind me of the traumas and emotions that remind me of how I felt at the time of the traumas; but I rarely have nightmares. In fact I rarely remember my dreams at all, so much so that I've often wondered if lack of REM sleep may be contributing to my problems sleeping and waking not rested. 

I had a nightmare last night, the first one in a couple of years. Thinking back on what I remember of it makes me wonder *why* my mind registered it as a nightmare; but I awoke suddenly, coughing and gasping for breath, feeling absolute panic. In the dream (all I really remember of it), I walk to my kitchen window and look out; and my car is gone. There's an absence of snow where it's normally parked. I hear a sound in the dream, like something hitting the side of my house; and I woke up. 

At first, I didn't even realize I had been asleep. It ""felt"" like I had only just gone to bed. The residual anxiety I felt that just wouldn't let me fall back to sleep *made* me get out of bed and walk to the kitchen window, just like in the dream, to check on my car. *Of course* it was there, still covered in snow. It felt like déjà vu up until the point where I saw my car. I checked the time, 4:03 am. I went to bed around 1 am, so I must have been asleep. 

That dream's content had absolutely nothing to do with anything trauma related. The panic felt the same, but that's it. Dreams are weird. Now, I'm wondering *why* because it seems so random. The only thing I can come up with is maybe I'm feeling anxiety about the expected snowstorm tonight causing more power outages, especially considering I would be stranded here with no help and the possibility of my elderly cat and me freezing to death. 

I live in a very rural community with limited resources. Even with all of the power outages a couple of days ago, no emergency shelters opened up for those without power. The county to the north of me opened a shelter, but they were only open for that county's residents and I wouldn't have been able to drive out on these back roads anyway. Snow is usually a rare treat where I live in TN. Ice storms are even more rare but far more dangerous since we don't have the infrastructure to deal with them in a timely manner. 

I don't know. Maybe it's just that feeling of helplessness or it could be the fear of dying alone and no one discovering my body until months later.

Also with Covid, England is in full lock down again, so all my therapy sessions are over the phone and I know that my family can hear which really sucks.

I keep getting horrible intrusive thoughts, have been for a few years. It's making me feel really really anxious and guilty and it makes me avoid being around anyone younger than me. I get panicky and scared if I am around kids because I am so scared that I am going to hurt them they way I was hurt. 

I tell myself that I am not gonna do anything because I know that it's wrong and that it is unforgivable, but I just can't get it out of my head. I'm also overthinking every interaction I've ever had, especially as a kid - did I hurt someone? What is and isn't a normal interaction between kids? What if I have made someone suffer the way I am without even knowing it?

I'm scared to tell my therapist because I'm embarrassed. I don't want her to think I am a p*do, I feel like I have to keep it a secret. I don't really know what to do?

It's hard to think of -everything-, but whether in a good period or bad period, there seem to be little things people do that they just didn't need to check/repeat before.

A harmless little example from me is that I strongly prefer to sit at a certain angle, in a certain part of the train, facing the direction of the conductor. I can handle someone coming up behind me on good days, but it'll fuck me up a bit on bad days, even if I know they're there. Little concessions like that. I stand if the right seat isn't available.

He knew what was happening. I just really messed up.

But I finally opened up to my husband about one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life. I haven't told anyone about it in great detail. I just let it all out, sobbing and shaking and wanting to run away. He just held me and listened. He validated my feelings and reassured me that nothing was my fault. I've struggled with it for so long, and it has held me back because so many things bring it to the surface again, and I don't want to deal with it. I don't know what brought it to the surface this time, but I had destructive results. 

He didn't let me feel like I had messed, though. He reminded me that a relapse doesn't erase the progress I've made. He cleaned me up and sat with me until I was okay again. He checks up on me and reminds me that everything is okay. 

I know he's really worried about me and I hate it so much. He'll feel like I can't be alone for too long. He'll check my body as inconspicuously as possible to make sure there aren't any new marks.

I was just recalling my worst episode of psychosis (borderline personality is another diagnosis) on another thread, and it took me back to my childhood experiences with psychosis. A casual thought at the back of my mind that's so easy to ignore was asking why in almost every episode am I about to be murdered, and why is the perpetrator always holding a knife? As a child it was always Ghostface from Scream who I believed was coming to kill me. When I was in my early 20s it was Victoria Climbie, a girl who was tortured and murdered in 2000. Every now and then since I saw him in a nightmare a couple of weeks ago, it's been a young boy.

And just now I wondered, why the knife? And holy cow it hit me like a ton of bricks. I can't believe I never realised this before.

300,Moodypineapples,1613351660,"Hi, I’m (18F) and over the past few months I’ve been trying to understand my mental health a lot, and a lot of signs recently have been pointing to PTSD.
I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for a lot of my life, I’ve had a lot of parental stress too, my mum, someone who has very flip flop emotions and tense, my dad, an alcoholic and passed away not long after I turned 15, both amazing people and I hold so so much love for them, just sometimes things feel/felt complicated, and I don’t know if maybe it’s linked to that? 
So,
1) with my dad, I found out about his drinking around the age of 12 and it was a big reality check, when my dad has always been someone I’ve idolised in my life, I would confront him and talk to him about his issues and we went in circles, to the point I’d just avoid seeing him for weeks (him and my mum have been split up since I can remember and don’t think that’s an effect) and the last time I saw him, was October 2017, and I tried to see him for my birthday (12 dec) after not speaking for months, because I couldn’t take it due to my mental health being generally bad, being around the toxic energy of a drunk was too much, and he wasn’t able to see me, we called and texted, and we were going to see him on Christmas Day, he wasn’t answering his calls and my mum drive to his house to find him dead on Christmas morning, so that was, something.
2) since my dad passed, I of course did what everyone does, you cry, you feel down, you get upset when you think about them, but for the past 3 years since he passed, I have refused to think about him, I don’t go anywhere near his street, I don’t think about him, I don’t cry over him and when I do think about him, it feels like 3 years ago, but distant, like I’m so distant from my emotions associated with him, it’s almost like he wasn’t real in my brain. And then during anything from cleaning my room, to in the middle of a conversation with someone, I’ll just have a thought like ‘he’s gone, you don’t have a dad’ and I’ve never really accepted that as true, and I don’t know if that’s a normal way to grieve or linked to a sort of trauma due to our relationship, he was wonderful and a life inspiration, but it was constantly going from 0-100 and back again with us.

2) my mum, she’s always been caring and when she understands, she’s supportive, but when it comes to me emotionally, and her emotionally, it’s very stressful. She can be really lovely and affectionate and understanding and caring at one point and then an our later she can be screaming at everyone in the house for forgetting to do something, or not doing a chore straight after one of me or my siblings have been told.
Or with my mental health, I always feel weird to talk to her about my mentality because of the way she can react, again, sometime it’s great, she’ll help me through things and if I tell her I need help, she will and other times she’ll be frustrated with me because I’m struggling with simple things, or saying I’m being dramatic, or suddenly shouting at me for things I can’t help.
For example, I recently started taking setraline a month ago and because of the side effects and that they can cause anxiety, I was telling her I had a moment were I almost had a panic attack, and she started talking to me in an agitated manner ‘why are you having panic attack? You’re on meds, they must not be working? They’re not supposed to do that, blah blah blah’ and it was really distressing and disheartening, and she commonly does this when I open up to her, so as time has gone by, over the years I just avoid talkibg about it, which caused her more frustration when I don’t tell her how I am.

3) This one has been confusing me a lot, because I can’t tell if it’s my normal anxiety or something different.
I’ve been havibg this experience or feeling, an example is, I was at my partners, completely content and we’ve been together for years so I’m always very comfortable and then suddenly I start to feel really tense and anxious and finding it difficult to breath and become shakey and it’s happened a few times, not on at hers but at many other situations too, and I’ve been making sure to backtrack what I was thinking about before feeling anxious, and it’s been nothing triggering I’d be thinking about.
I’ve also recently been having a need for physical touch, which is something I’ve noticed, I feel tense and I get upset when I’m alone, even just to feel someone stroking my shoulder or to be hugged etc, is something I crave a lot, which I never used to feel, and I have never been a super clingy person, and the only thing I can relate it to is separation anxiety, I see my partner every weekend, which is a lot during covid times, and whenever we say goodbye and the other goes home, I’m fine for a while and then I start to feel anxious without it and by the end of the week I just feel really tense.
Idk.

4) a few months ago I came across what ‘derealisation/depersonalisation’ which I related to a lot because I definitely am someone that feels very spacey and dissociates from strong emotions and time can fly very quickly for me but again, I don’t know for sure, I haven’t seen a therapist in years and cabt really figure out.

5) I’ve been tested for autism in the past, which was negative and was something that came up due to my anxieties and the dissociation and I’ve been meaning to read up on other neurodivergance disabilities just incase.

But yes, I’m not even entirely sure if it is PTSD, but I thought it would be good to post for some advice or other points of view.

301,quietasari0t,1613349241,"Tw: CSA, other violent abuse. 

I started going to therapy again a couple months ago. Due to the volume of patients and my providers approach to mental health, I do video calls with her once a month and I can check in via message. I did so recently because I feel like I can’t cope. I will be talking to someone about medication next week. 

I was molested from age 8 to about 12ish? It’s fuzzy. The violent abuse began when I was young, 5 years old is my earliest recollection. My ex stepfather  would continue to physically and mentally abuse me until I was about 16 and started fighting back. Then the mental fuckery continued even after I got married back in 2004. He would pound on my apartment door while I was home with my newborn daughter and my husband was deployed. I remember calling the cops and the damn coward running away, and then getting a letter later on telling me he had rights as her grandfather to see her. Fuck that. I went and got a restraining order after that. I was terrified. And I feel that way again. I look at my teenage daughters and I’m scared for them because there are so many men out there like him. And so few good men, like their father. 

I went to therapy years ago but I was a much different person then. I wasn’t ready back then to peel back the layers. I’m ready now because I’ve realize just how detrimental the PTSD has become to me. I’ve developed OCD which really didn’t bother me until recently. 

I also had an interaction with someone who reminded me so much of my abuser. I heard his voice first. I was up on a ladder at work, zoned out with my music and doing my work, and then it was like a record scratch when I heard his voice. I turned around and saw a guy who not only sounded like him, but looked like and even had the same mannerisms as my abuser. I felt like I was unbothered by it. I told my husband and he was a little weirded out. Told a good friend too (who is one of very very few that knows my history) and he was like.... omg. Was it him? Luckily it was not. 

But ever since then I feel raw and vulnerable. Thoughts and flashbacks creep into my head when I’m trying to be intimate or even affectionate to my husband. He is so kind and patient and understands- we’ve been together 17 years so he knows my ups and downs. 

I’m furious at myself because I hate feeling this way. I was doing so well for so many years. I feel like it’s a combination of the therapy and seeing someone who looked like the abuser. I’m terrified to go out in public and takes a lot of reassurance to myself to even go in a grocery store. I was feeling frustrated and stuck and my husband was like, why don’t you go do something, get out of the house and have a break. Can’t do it.

I love my career and the schooling that goes with it but the happiness I’ve felt from that has been drained too. 

I’m terrified that this is who I’m going to be stuck as. I’m scared that I made a mistake in going back to therapy because now those things wounds feel fresh and raw again. I’m angry again and haven’t been angry in years. I want to run away and hide and haven’t felt that in years either.

302,69420Dota,1613347189,"Hey guys, I'm a 19 year old from Syria.

I was born and raised in Damascus and when I was young I had a lot of close calls with bombs and missiles.

I remember one time a bomb went off on my way to school, its kind of hazy but one thing I remember clearly is how terrified I was, my teacher fainting on the bus, my friend screaming ""I don't want to die"", all the smoke and car horns going off.

Another close call I had was when I was running to my dad's car to grab something for him and a missile fell one street behind, it was so loud and I completely froze up until my dad came and picked me up and took me back inside.

The reason I'm posting is because my friend recently told me I might have PTSD. Mental health is a myth in Syria, I don't want to say anything controversial but people here still believe that being LGBT is a mental disorder so I can't seek professional help because I feel like these ""professionals"" don't  know what the hell they're doing and even if I could It's going to be really expensive.

My problem is that whenever I hear a loud noise (Door slam, Power generator turning on, etc..) I get cold, very cold, my feet and hands especially, my stomach starts to hurt, I panic instantly and get the urge to close my ears and sit down in a corner, it lasts a good hour until after I know I'm safe, it's extremely bad when Israel bombs Syria, my friends try to calm me down by saying that we're safe and they aren't targeting civillians but it doesn't help at all, it actually just happened and I completely lost my shit, I'm still shaking.

I was talking to my friend and she said that she's pretty sure it's PTSD, she's no expert though (we're both english majors) so I was hoping I could get confirmation and maybe some advice on what to do.

306,-civic,1613338453,"Trigger warning: child abuse and attempted murder victim, COVID

Hello, I have PTSD from severe child abuse/child neglect, a severely abusive relationship with a sociopath (attempted murder), a very difficult financially exploitative relationship with a drug addict, and being a COVID ICU nurse during a pandemic. 

There has been a lot of toxicity at my work and the nurses at my job are extremely competitive and unkind. There are two of them who try everything they can to keep other nurses from getting recognized by the managers or from moving up/getting into grad school. It’s because they just want to stay at the bedside, but that’s a different subject all together. 

So, on top of the constant onslaught of death and mass casualty I’ve been experiencing (basically every covid ICU patient dies or has permanent lung damage—not all COVID patients but all the ICU COVID patients do), and not being able to see my friends outside of work, I am constantly having to watch my back at work because of these jealous bitter night shift nurses who try to keep everyone else from getting ahead. Like, even when I basically “run” the unit and help every other nurse out and make life saving/prolonging decisions in the Knick of time, they find something minuscule to criticize and tell the manager, who never gets mad at me because I think she can see straight through the bullshit. But at the same time I think it’s making her wary of promoting me because of the negative attention she’ll get from these two psycho control freaks. 

This has been making my anxiety and PTSD completely out of control. I have nothing to keep me busy, which is my usual form of coping, which is avoidance. I typically am an extremely busy person, I’ve even been called a workaholic. I never sit still. The pandemic has been terrible for my mental health in so many ways, not just at work, but also my coping mechanisms are basically nonexistent at this point. 

I constant alternate between feeling extremely depressed and wanting to run away. I want to get on a plane and disappear from everything forever. I feel like a failure in my relationship and a terrible partner. The voice of my mother telling me I don’t deserve to be alive/I should’ve never been born is also extremely triggering and I keep having these extreme feelings of wanting to escape. I don’t want to die really I just want to escape all this pain. To make matters worse I am basically trapped in this job because they keep refusing my transfer requests and I need this job to apply for CRNA school. I also have my degree about $10,000 paid for through this job and it requires you to stay on for 2 years. So I can’t leave the hospital system either let alone the unit. 

I don’t really want to run away but I don’t know how to fight these feelings. I keep feeling like things would be easier if I ended my relationship and moved back into my empty condo. But I know that’s not really going to help and will only cause more pain long term because I love my partner and I want to marry him and have a future with him. Sometimes the idea of a future or potential future is terrifying though because of the potential that he could cheat on me or leave me eventually. Or that he could die of cancer. Or that if we had children they’d be deformed or sick. Or that if we had children he’d abandon us because it’s too hard. So it makes me want to run away from any possibility of that happening. Intimate relationships are so difficult for me for so many reasons and my current life situation is unbearable.   I also can tell my depression and anxiety is weighing him down and it makes me feel so guilty and worthless. Like I’m a terrible partner because of all these issues and emotional flashbacks and emotionally out of control reactions to so many things.

309,regularhuman2685,1613336202,"So I'm someone with PTSD from a sexual assault, and I'm sure it is a common experience for a lot of PTSD sufferers to have trouble enforcing boundaries. I'm dealing with a situation at work where someone I have to interact with somewhat regularly keeps standing way too close to me when I do have to interact with him. Close enough to be uncomfortable for me personally under normal circumstances and WAY too close for social distancing.

Maybe it sounds so easy since I can use social distancing as an ""excuse"" here but considering how long we've been doing this whole pandemic thing and how long my workplace has been talking about social distancing guidelines basically daily it's obvious this guy doesn't get it. And I've been communicating with my body language for a while that I'm not comfortable, but when I step away from him he moves closer. It's ridiculous and obviously this ignorance of my body language signals makes this whole thing even more triggering and frightening for me. I'm still giving the benefit of the doubt that he just hasn't picked up on it and it's more obliviousness than malice but that generosity definitely has a shelf life.

I obviously have to just say something. It's stupid I would have to but as demonstrated this guy isn't getting it. It's hard for me to be assertive and direct with people about boundaries but I want to work on it, so I'm seeking advice on how to handle this. How do I say something in a cordial, professional way that's still firm? How do I mute the very annoying people pleasing voice in my head telling me that I will be seen as rude?

so whats your story? how has therapy been for you so far (if you go to therapy?) has it helped? and what sort of therapy are you doing? how do you feel like it has impacted your life, especially learning ability and focus in school?

ill start with my own story: i had some medical issues and they involved two surgeries , a lot of pain, and christmas in the hospital, and then a long way to recovery. then i started experiencing shit anxiety attacks, flashbacks, nightmares, and went to therapy and got diagnosed with ptsd. we started working with Sensory-Motor Psychotherapy, and it helped a lot! In a year, my anxiety was gone, and I was feeling really well. 6 months later my dog died young, and I spiraled down into a depression and got diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with symptoms of Dissociation and Depression, and got prescribed Antidepressants. And then we started using EMDR therapy, and we’ve only done 2 sessions so far but it was absolutely excruciating, and it made me really suicidal for a few days afterwards. i realized that most of my school focus issues are rooted in the surgery trauma (which happened 2 years ago) and i got terrified that i’ll have to deal with that for the rest of my life, after i ‘naive-ly’ thought we sorted that out :)) Well, now i’m having a bit of an existential crisis because I had big plns for my future, applying to a good uni and having a good life.

I’ve had a fairly traumatic life. I’ve seen some very dark shit. I wrote up a long explanation post, earlier, but oddly, Reddit wouldn’t let me post it anywhere, so... Nevermind, and here we are.

Anyway, a lot of the terrible, traumatic things I have experienced were orchestrated by, or even done by, people in positions of power or authority over me. In particular, I’ve seen the dark side of administration and bureaucracy. The “system”, as it were, in my country...

I’ve also had some incredibly toxic relationships. I just... Seem to fall into them. Perhaps due to growing up with it, and, as someone else suggested, subconsciously falling for people who behave similarly... I don’t know.

My question is, though - after all I’ve experienced, all I’ve seen, and all that has been done to me - how do I learn to open up, and trust again? Not just romantically, but to friends, to positions of authority, to... Other parts of that same bureaucracy, that ruined my life, in the past...

More than that, though: how do I learn to live with it? Not to forgive. I don’t want to forgive. But I do... Want to stop the burst of memory from flooding back, like last night. I want to stop the guilt, the hurt, and the regret. I want to stop blaming myself. No matter how many times I watch that scene in Good Will Hunting, I just... Can’t forgive myself for the things that I have done, and that have happened to me...

When COVID hit, he started to take some clients at his home and he would charge a little less than he would in the salon. 

This was my 3rd time going to his house for a haircut. The other 2 times, everything was normal. Again, professional. Sometimes we would discuss our love lives very briefly. I knew he was dating someone recently and I was happy for him. 

At today's appointment, I wasn't very chatty. I was really tired and just enjoying the feeling of someone touching my hair. When I first arrived and he was about to shampoo my hair, he asked if I had any Valentine's plans tomorrow. I said no, I'm single this year. 

We moved on to the haircut. I noticed he had a glass of wine on his counter. He told me has hadn't eaten today and he's a little tipsy. Ha-ha. I didn't think anything of it.

He asked me if I'm straight... I'm like...""yes?"" He continued the haircut. He asked me, ""Are you on any dating sites?"" I told him I was taking a break from dating, focusing on my new job, etc.

This still affects me and I feel absolutely stupid for it. It happened a few years ago, and I just feel like it “wasn’t bad enough” since it’s not like he punched me or stabbed me.

The other trauma is from when I had a friend. At first she seemed nice, she’d give me gifts and compliments a lot. The person that she was friends with, that I also befriended, was always quiet or hurt in some way. At some point she was able to tell me that she was actually abusive, and at first I wasn’t sure if I’d believe her, but then she started begging me to not talk to her anymore. So I decided to confront her about it. And she just completely changed. She went from happy and bubbly to angry and almost psychotic. I guess she thought there was no point in hiding it anymore since she started insulting and gaslighting and hitting her right in front of me. I tried to stop her but then she turned on me. That’s when she started abusing me. She’d hit me and beat me up, chocked me until I passed out or almost passed out several times, and took advantage of my ptsd from the earlier mentioned event and triggered me constantly. She said that she was the only one who’s ever care about me and that I was lucky that she didn’t kill me right there and rid the world of such a burden. But she didn’t, since she wanted my death to be slow and painful according to her. We weren’t allowed to do anything without her permission. We couldn’t talk, or eat, or use the bathroom and stuff or she’d hit us or something. She used it to humiliate us. And since we weren’t eating well, especially me, she enjoyed taking our food and eating it in front of us or not letting us eat and making us look at it. Then she’d throw it away. She’d tell us stories of her earlier victims, and we’d have to praise her or she’d hurt us. She also touched and raped me several times and purposely made it hurtful because she wanted me in as much pain as possible. Sometimes when I did something she deemed wrong, or just exist in general, she’d beat her up and make me watch. Anything I did could make it worse, like if I protested or looked away. The whole time she’d blame me, telling me that I made her do it and that I was a terrible person. Sometimes she did her “punishments” and when I’d ask her why she’d say that me existing was enough of a reason because I was such a terrible person. Because of nightmares every night from the incident with the man, I was barely sleeping, so I’d doze off during the day. She took advantage of it and anytime I did she’d trigger me or hit me and then anytime I started dozing off or just fall asleep I’d freak out cuz I connected sleep = pain even more. I tried to tell the other people in my camp, but she made them think that I was the abusive/mean one, so they never believed me and blamed me. When I tried to tell them about the raping they’d think that I was lying cuz a girl couldn’t rape another girl, and that I wanted it since I orgasmed, and if they did believe me they’d say I finally got what I deserved and praised her for it. I tried to tell the counselors but they’d bring us out together so she’d just make me lie then punish me afterwards. I’m surprised they never heard us scream, or saw us cry or the bruises. The only reason the other girl hid hers at the camp was so no one mentioned it and she got it trouble with her for it, since her parents didn’t even care whether she lived or died and she had to take care of herself and they never asked. The girl was also like 2 or 3 years older than us and stronger than us so we were never able to fight back, and she lowered our self esteems enough that most of the time we didn’t cuz we felt like we deserved it. Another thing she did was take advantage of my paranoia that he’d come back (he said that he would and nothing would stop him), saying stuff like “You’re sure he can’t find you?” Or “he might know where you live, cuz ya know the internet’s crazy now.” And stuff. 

This all happened in a year, when I was 11. I've only told my partner the whole story

This only went on for like 3 months so I feel like I’m just invading with actually abuse survivors, since there’s other being with their abusers for like 3 years, or even a decade and stuff. And I feel like I deserved it since I never really fought back, or cuz I was stupid enough to believe her in the beginning when she said I was dreaming it up, or in the very beginning when I thought she was a nice person. My partner says that it wasn’t my fault and I didn’t deserve it, but I don’t feel that way, so I was hoping to get other opinions on it. I feel really pathetic and overdramatic to not be over it, since it's been a few years.

327,Selkie_Muffin,1613261628,"So IDK where to write this but here seemed like the right place. Lately I've been remembering something from when I was younger and I'm not sure why or how to make it stop. Basically, this is what happened. 

When I was four, my dad had gone away for jury duty. The only people in the house where me (4), my brother (nearly 1) and my mom. We where going down the stairs when suddenly my mom slipped. She tossed my brother onto the landing so that he wouldn't fall. I was already halfway down the stairs and my mother crashed into me. My mom sort of cradled me while we fell and that combined with all her extra weight from having been pregnant sort of cushioned the fall for me. Except that my hand had been sticking out and hit each one of the little spokes that hold the railing up. We fell all the way down and crashed through a metal baby gate. My mom landed on her back on hardwood floor and couldn't get up. She couldn't even move. All the could do was talk. She made me run and get the phone and call 911. My mom helped me a bit with the call like telling me what our address was, but I did most of the call. Then we just sat there and waited until the paramedics arrived. My brother was still stuck at the top of the stairs. When the paramedics got to our house they brushed right past me and went to my mom. Then they told us I wasn't allowed into the ambulance. When we asked why they said that I was not ""Seriously injured"" and that I was a child and wasn't allowed on, which is absurd. Also spoiler alert I had twisted my wrist and opened the back of my head and it was bleeding. So then my mom made me go and call all of our relatives to see if they could come. We couldn't call my dad he was at jury duty, and nobody was picking up their phone. In the end my mom made me call my grandfather. She had been holding off on doing this since he worries and already has some health conditions and didn't want him to suffer from this. But nobody else was answering so we called him. The speed at which he came to our house is astronomical. My grandparents lived about 20 minutes away in light traffic and he got to our house in about 5. The paramedics took my mom and my grandfather stayed to watch us. Later that day, the hospital discharged my mom despite the fact that she *literally couldn't walk.* My grandfather wasn't satisfied so he took us to our family doctor. They found out I twisted my wrist and opened my head and they helped fix that. They also found out my mom had broken multiple ribs and could barely move.

Anyways thats what happened. Lately I've just been remembering it. Like I'll be doing something and I'll just think about it. This has never bothered me before. The most effect this had on my is that going downstairs is a bit scary and I have to go down slowly and hold onto something. But I was never just thinking about what happened. I don't really know what to do to make it stop and I'm kind of confused as to why it's happening.

328,Musictheory_nerd,1613257137,"I have almost every single PTSD symptom due to a traumatic experience that happened to me when I was a child. I have gone many many years without a diagnosis, but lately my symptoms have gotten worse to the point that they are pretty debilitating. 

I want to seek a diagnosis so that I can look into treatment options and start to get symptom relief, but the problem is that my original trauma was perpetrated by a therapist I saw as a child. This makes therapists one of my biggest trauma triggers. So my question is, can a GP diagnose PTSD, and are there alternative treatments for PTSD that aren't therapy?

334,Pinkabutter,1613235308,"I've had pretty severe ptsd symptoms from abuse for a few years that have progressively gotten worse.

I turned 17 in December and that was the day I drove with my mom out of state to my grandma's house because the next day we needed to take her off life support. She died shortly after being taken off. I stayed with my mom at my grandma's house for a couple weeks off and on helping pack up and just being there. By the time it was over it was a few days before Christmas.

A couple days after the holiday I worked for an elderly couple I've grown close to. That was Saturday. Monday I got a message from my neighbor asking about taking care of their dogs. The man had gotten covid pneumonia and the woman was in a car accident. The old man is home and doing well, stronger everyday he said. However the woman suddenly passed away. She was like another grandma to me. I would even say I was closer to her than my grandmas just because she was physically closer and I saw her more. I had worked for her for six years, last year I worked for her everyday for three months doing the cooking and cleaning and helping with some medical things. She was always so kind. We would eat together and talk about life. It was so sudden... 

It was a few days later my remaining grandma was on hospice and she passed away a week later. It's been nearly a month since everything happened. I haven't been sleeping and my ptsd has been worse. The other night I was texting my friend when an attack hit. I saw all my pets and family and friends dying in different realistic ways, except a few people who died in absurd ways. It was so bad I thought I was imagining talking to my friend. It took him ten or so minutes to convince me it was an attack and he was ok. I don't know why I had an attack like that.

TW: Suicide, Self harm, Abuse &amp; drug/alcohol misuse

So I've had alot of trauma in my life, and It's starting to effect me again

My mom was really abusive during my childhood, (physically and verbally), and I never really knew my dad, because my mom said ""he is a bad person, you dont want to see him"" even though he isnt.. as bad as she makes him seem. 

Anyways, when I was 12 years old, I saw my brother dead after he commit suicide. After that I developed alot of mental illness (PTSD, depression) 

My other brother, is starting to get abusive too, like my mom. 

I also recently got into a breakup—so thats just hard to deal with too.

Anyways I've been getting more and more flashbacks of what happened when i was 12, and im constantly waking up through the night crying.

I've started to turn to drugs and alcohol to numb myself, as well as some self harm. I'm not too sure what to do anymore. Sort of wishing I could just not be here anymore",ptsd,PTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lj3mmx/ptsd/,1613204733.0
