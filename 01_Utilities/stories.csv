Today I was walking home looking at my phone and I heard yelling in a house. I slowed down to listen and when I passed it some scary guy came out in a wifebeater and was yelling at me and shit. I just ignored him and continued walking home but then a cop pulled me over and thought I took a picture of the dudes house for whatever reason. He asked to see my pictures and it was sort of awkward cause my camera roll is mostly dirty memes but then he let me go. I go back to in person school on monday and now I'm gonna have to take a different route. I go every other week to school so my second week I'll go the normal way cause it should be warm enough to wear a sweater instead of a coat so I'll look different but man I'm worried that guy will beat my ass if I pass his house on the way to school,stories,Scary-ish thing today,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lrg87y/scaryish_thing_today/,1614153727.0

The Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there.

""Ah,” said he, where can you see such noble horns as these, ¡with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight.

At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him.

Away bounded the Hart, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up.",stories,The hunter,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lrejrz/the_hunter/,1614149218.0
3,ladikalakonnaladequa,1614176812,"I don't know the name of this animated show yet. The plot of this show would be about Milo Stewart taking over the united states, Milo Stewart enslaved Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Once Milo Stewart took complete control, every rule that society was expected to follow was thrown out and anyone could do what ever they want. Milo Stewart is an entity that has existed as long as the earths creation. Milo Stewart takes the form of random human every 250 years, and the only way for this cycle to repeat is the collection of 15,000,000 human souls and once this goal is completed the entity that calls itself Milo Stewart disappears into the universe and returns after 250 years to take the form of a random human. Milo Stewart has learned over time causing the deaths 15,000,000 humans gets boring so Milo Stewart wanted to try something new. Milo Stewart created a Gladiator style fighting ring there is no one attending besides Milo Stewart and two henchmen and the people that were forced to fight to the death.

Milo Stewart's henchmen: Kat Blaque and Riley Dennis, both of these people are forced to follow Milo Stewart's orders or Milo Stewart will either make their tits disappear or cause a massive beard to grow on their faces that can't be shaved or cut off. Or Milo Stewart will do a much simpler option just kill them.

Certain people will have supernatural abilities

Milo Stewart: The main antagonist, Milo Stewart's supernatural abilities are unmatched by any being. Milo Stewart is able to manipulate time, it does not affect Milo Stewart, teleport, create purple tendrils that come out of Milo Stewart's hands, the tendrils are able to grapple onto anything and is able to destroy all of the cells of any creature instantly if Milo Stewart wants to. Milo Stewart is also able to scream ''All white people are racist'' over and over again this will cause any living organism that can hear to try to cover there ears and take out as much sound as possible. There is a part two to this ability Milo Stewart can scream ""All men are misogynistic"" after the ""All white people are racist"" and what happens after the second line is the death of any living organism in a 500 mile radius. Milo Stewart can also fly and float at any moment and change the way anything looks.

Kat Blaque: Kat Blaque is able to manipulate the ground with a quick leg kick. Kat Blaque can also stomp the ground and crack the ground in half. Kat Blaque is physically very strong and can take a lot of damage while fighting. Kat Blaque is also talented in hand to hand combat.

Riley Dennis: Riley Dennis is able to fly, teleport and manipulate light. Riley Dennis is able to shoot a burst of light in a quick hand motion. This light is able to blind anyone temporally, besides Milo Stewart. Riley Dennis is able to create a strong burst of light that can burn through anything, besides Milo Stewart. This process is very difficult to do and leaves Riley Dennis very physically exhausted. Riley Dennis does not usually fight with fists but if Riley Dennis see's an opportunity Riley Dennis will take that chance.

Milo Stewart wanted to focus on well known people how are ""LGBTQ"" mainly people who fit the ""T"" and there is some characters who will fit the ""Q"". Milo Steward gave Kat Blaque and Riley Dennis a list of people to capture and there addresses while Milo Stewart was creating the gladiator styled fighting ring. Milo Stewart told Kat Blaque to focus on people on the list who are near to fighting ring. Which is the whole LA region and to team up completely with Riley Dennis after everyone on the list in that region is captured. Milo Stewart told Riley Dennis to focus on areas farther away since Riley Dennis is able to teleport. If either one of them fails the mission Milo Stewart will kill them both and do all of the capturing, which would take more time and make everything a lot less fun for Milo Stewart. Since the united states is in complete anarchy all of the people on the list will have other issues to be dealing with will them more prone to getting abducted.

Side Characters

Gozi Kodzo: Gozi Kodzo became a dictator, Gozi Kodzo created a socialist facist group who's purpose is to kill all white people in the united states.

The flag of the group know as ''Gozi's black supremacists"" is a black nazi symbol with a rainbow backround. The group travels west looting any store for weapons and food and killing any white person they come across.

Vaush: Vaush left his home shortly after Milo Stewart took over. Vaush's girlfriend said ''I want to go outside to get some fresh air'' She never came back. This happened two months before the united states became an Anarchist country. Vaush traveled south east by car for 550 miles going through abandoned hospitals and collecting as much scrap and random technology as possible until a cave caught his eye. The cave had large metal doors that were slightly opened on the outside and seemed to be abandoned. There was no one in the cave. There was a large computer in the cave, it was still functional. Vaush stayed in this cave building technology made out of car parts and leftover scrap. This  cave became Vaush's new home.

Samantha Lux: Samantha Lux is possessed by an entity that takes full control when topics such as is it hateful to have dating preferences are brought up. Once this happens Samantha Lux will start to float, Samantha's head will start to twist in 190 degrees. Samantha lux will began to ask a question in deep raspy voice that will echo around the room ""Would you fuck me?"" if the person says no Samantha Lux will point at the person and screech ""Transphobic"" a hole will be burned into any clothing the person is wearing until it burns the skin slightly. A curse will be placed on that person, they will die in 12 days from an unknown STD with no cure. If the person says yes Samantha Lux will be visually disgusted and say ""  Ew, I already got a mans, but thank you though""

Bootleg Samantha Lux/Mathilda Hogberg: Mathilda Hogberg is not possessed by an entity. Mathilda hogberg just copies almost everything Samantha Lux does.

There is going to be more side characters such as Shoeonhead who is going to be an assistant to Vaush and eventually Shoeonhead will betray Vaush. Jessica Yaniv will have one scene where Jessica Yaniv will confront an adolescent girl and say ""I'm going to teach you how to put in a tampon.

He hadn’t enslaved humanity, instead he linked their souls in a way so they felt as one. Their minds were linked in a way where everyone knew each others thoughts, but still had the ability to think for themselves. Whatever he did to one was felt by all. And he made sure that all Humanity would ever feel is Pain. This is how he wanted the world to feel.

No one could understand his pain,
so he made sure everyone would understand each others.

We don’t know how he attained this power, but it was done and nothing to be done about it. With every strike to one person, humanity fell to its knees and with every whip, their spirits were shattered to the bone. “He enjoys this” was a common thought among humanity. “What did we do?” Was another. Disdainfully he looked down upon humanity and with that condescension in his eyes the world would never again know peace. What was his goal? What was the point of all this? 

After many, many years humans had almost lost their individuality in the mush of thoughts that everyone shared. Their bodies and spirits were broken to the core, and although all wished for death, it would not be so. They had however found friendship in one another. Not that it could be helped as no one could keep secrets from each other, and they instead worked towards building humanity to stand against their Oppressor. The Man knew of their thoughts however, and whenever they got close, he’d break their minds and their bodies again. To make sure they stayed down. 

A surprise declaration was made, by the bloodthirsty tyrant himself saying: 

*I’m doing this for you.*

All at once humanity became a mash of emotions. After years of torture and hellish anguish this is all this man had to say? And it’s utter nonsense?? With the crack of his whip humanity once again became silent. The World resumed in its pathetically worn state.

Generations have passed, and nothing has changed. The Tyrant spoke again:

*Its almost time everyone. For your Salvation*

There were no words from humanity, just sounds of agony as the whip cracked one last time. 

The earth began to shake, and the once blue sky had turned red, the sun disappeared behind the clouds and from the sky came down a Man riding a White horse. In all his brilliance, he revealed himself to be the son of God; here to once again redeem all of mankind. It was Judgement Day. 

Humanity had grown weary of their endless torment, and pleaded unto this familiar man they they be saved from this Oppressor. The tyrant stood silent. The Man on the White Horse rose his hand, and the souls of all Humans and animals were taken with him to the sky. The Tyrant fell to his knees. Still silent, but oddly enough, relieved.

When they awoke, they noticed to be standing on the sky. It was infinitely blue in all directions, with nothing around but the yellow sun magnifying its brilliance. A clear, calming voice spoke to the souls of the previously oppressed. 

*It wouldn’t be fair to judge those who haven’t had a chance to live. So I brought all of you here to show you the paradise you’ve yearned for*

A golden gate had appeared, and the souls rejoiced as it opened, revealing a perfect Utopia, their new home. All of humanity has made it to Heaven. One small soul asked of their Oppressor, and his whereabouts. The Calming voice reassured her that he was in a place where he could never harm anyone again.

Back on a cold, dark Earth; the Man had been doomed eternally to walk alone. It would not bother him for quite some time, as he had expected this outcome. The Man on the White Horse rode towards him. When he caught up, he asked him:

*Was it worth it?*

The Man looked up at Son of God, with a smile on his face, and said:

*I don’t know. Did everyone make it?*",stories,Broken Savior,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lrc3jt/broken_savior/,1614142184.0
8,ErbzNdBuds,1614169381,"I have been holding some of this back for a while my closest know some most know none, none know all. My punctuation and grammar are most likely awful.

M/21-25/UK

Well to start from the very beginning I have to go back to when I was 15 but I'll take you there just shortly. Everything was fairly normal (ish) I've had a very tough childhood anyway but I'll leave that for another time. I was walking in work one day as a apprentice chef I had a major pain shoot though the right side of my body and woke up in hospital. I'd had kidney failure, kidneys stones, polyps and mass hematuria (loads of blood) I've peed blood ever since but been okay ish. 

Skip forward to about 4 years ago, I went to Canterbury hospital to have a camera put up my urethra into my bladder and kidneys to see where to blood was still coming from all these years later. I had a very rough surgery and was in recovery for hours. When I awoke I had a horrible pain in my lower back and my penis was burning beyond belief. I had some string painkillers and drifted in and out for a while

A couple of hours later, I'm going through the after surgery motions (something to eat, something to drink, observations for a bit). Then comes the next part, I get up to the toilet expecting a pain similar to a water infection but worse. I should have mentioned earlier that this isn't the first time I've had this procedure, if my memory serves me correct its my third time. Anyway I digress. 

So I get up to the toilet, walking like I've shat myself with my gown open at the back no dignify in the world left. I get in the very large disabled style toilet and use the railings to help me sit down for this one and brace for what's coming, but to my surprise, and utter horror nothing happened, I couldn't feel anything inside me, I couldn't feel the muscles in my badder or my penis contracting. It was like I had forgotten how to go, like a part of me that's was there just hours before had completely gone. I tried, oh how I tried. Tears were streaming down my face my body was shaking it might sound like nothing but I was terrified.

I've left the toilet now, got myself together, tied my gown back up together properly and headed back to my bed. I use my buzzer on my bed to call the nurse over and explain my situation, she tells me to take it as easy as I can she will get me a bladder scan and page the urological on call. Lady nurse comes over with a troll with what looked like a laptop and a probe, turns out it's an ultrasound machine that measures the amount of fluid in the bladder and gives you a reading instad of giving you a look inside. 750ml ""we're going to have to catheterise you."" This words will ring in my head forever. (If you're unfamiliar on what catheter is then it's thin tube around 8-12 inches long with a deflated balloon and hole at one end and a much larger hole and filling port at the other end.) The tube is pushed into your bladder through the eye of your penis and the down the shaft until it's in far enough saline can be injected into the filling port inflating the balloon thus stopping it from coming back out). Doctor comes around and explains that's it's most likely due to inflammation and trauma of the procedure and to go home with the urethal catheter for 2-4 weeks, come back to the hospital have it removed and try again to go to the toilet.

Skipping forward to 4 weeks later so what would become to be know as TWOC: Trial WithOut Catheter. I was led into a room shortly after arriving where the deflated the balloons and pulled out this long clear pee filled tube that's had started to become an extra and hated part of my very self. With a gasp and whimper it was out and I could breathe again. The lady nurse told me to drink as much water as I can from a 1.0L jug and let them know when I had the feeling I needed to the toilet. So I sat there reading crap on my phone and people watching drinking this water like a good patient. The time came about an hour later I had finished the jug i was given. I called for the nurse as you have to attempt to pee on a flow rate machine. Just the same as after my procedure four weeks ago j couldn't feel anything. I had completely lost the ability to control my bladder in any way, shape, or form. After being taught how to out a catheter in myself to drain the pee four to six times a day I was sent home to wait for a follow up.

Couple of months later I go for what's called a ""Urodynamics Study/Test) basically it's a tests that will tell me a bit about why my bladders isnt working anymore. I have the test done and it shows no detrusor activity and no pressure to aid in mictrition. In normal terms for no apparent reason my bladder has died and there's no getting it back. That's was the moment I feel my life changed forever. I'm to go home again and carry on with the self catheterisation and await an hour outpatient appointment with a urologist. It was decided after seeing the urologist that I would get a superpubic catheter (goes In my belly instead of my penis) as the scarring from the penis ones and the pain was affecting me quite badly and affecting my sex life massively.

This is where things actually get much, much worse. So the surgery for the supapubic comes around and I go into to hospital a couple of days to have the surgery and a short inpatient zrecovery. Things go relatively well and it's feels less invasive in my belly than it does elsewhere. A couple if months down the line I contacted sepsis, managed to get rid with help from hospital.

Couple of month later after a catheter change I contract a hospital born infection called acinetobacter baumannii. Basically a bug which only job is to shut down your immune system and take out intensive care units. I managed to get rid of that one after extensive use of antibiotics and multiple hospital admissions. Life was okay ish for a while a few minor infections and the problems that come with a catheter to all users. Then bam! Serratia marcescens another hospital born infection multiple drug resistance I was told by Margate QEQM that they wouldn't admid due to the infection and there was nothing they could do inoes I turned septic. I spend a few days being more unwell than I had ever been before in my life, I had no energy, my whole body hurt I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, light hurt my eyes, I had hot and cold sweats with a fever, I was being sick my pee was crimson red I had rashes and skin breaks all over my body, my chest hurt, the palpitations I was having made it look like my heart was going to be right out of my chest. I was tacyacardic, having bladder spasm after bladder spasm, I could hardly stand or move. It was this point I decided I was going to make videos saying goodbye to my two young children and my OH. It broke me, twisted me, crushed me, but I didn't want to go without leaving them something. 

A scrape the empty reminents of my souless broken body together and force myself to Kent Canterbury hospital with the onset of urosepsis.

""""Mr C, if you keep leaving it until you get like this you're going to run out if chances, we can help the living we can't bring back the dead, what I'm earth are we going to do with you, you need to look after yourself."" 

A couple if days, some tests, I.V antibiotics bladder flushes, catheter change, acid bladder washout, and lots of fluids go by. I'm crying orange tears, I'm sweating orange sweat, I'm peeing in shades of brown, and red, but slowly the world, the reality start to find their way back. ""Am I getting better? I'm feeling better, what did you do?"" ""We found it, the one thing the bug couldn't take, its why your waste is shades of orange, and why your back with us."" "" I told you, we help the living."" They did for me what I thought was impossible brought me back from the very edge, right at the point I was ready to give up, no scratch that, i had given up. 

Things have been okay ish since then but I'm meant to have my catheter changed every 6 weeks because I get bladder stones and the catheter sticks to the inside of my badder and the base of my urethra. Due to moving and then Covid-19 I have I my had four changes in the last two years meaning most of that time has been spent using a walking stick and/or a wheelchair to get about as well as being on fentanyl for the pain. I wake up in pain everyday I go to sleep in pain everyday it's currently been 13 weeks and counting since my last change and every day right now is agony. Sometimes I feel death would be better. 

Sometimes I cut myself just to see how much it bleeds but now I'm ending my life because i don't like what I see I feel the blood running out of my veins. I'm hoping if I die tonight it will take away the pain.",stories,A medical dilemma.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lrbl2q/a_medical_dilemma/,1614140581.0

TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide and Substance abuse

“What are you doing?”, Lilian questioned, standing across from me. I was sat on the table with an empty pill bottle on the floor.  “Quit acting like you care, just leave,” I muttered out. She tried to mumble out a collection of false words to instill some sort of untrue hope. I stood up from the table to confront her face to face, but I immediately fell onto the shivering hardwood floor. Bracing myself to get back up, my hands stepped into a puddle of liquid, that I guessed was my own blood. She ran over to me, seeming as if she cared, but I didn’t bide into her lies anymore. “You need to go to the hospital, you need help,”, she frantically pulled her phone out of her purse. I tried to grab it, but I couldn’t feel my hands. It’s a weird sensation to not feel your limbs. It almost feels as if you’re moving on a cloud. “I need an ambulance NOW!’’. I almost laughed a little, there’s no way that I’m surviving this but that’s what I wanted. For them to finally realize how much they don’t care. It only took a few more seconds for me to not move at all. Lilian grabbed my hand and for the first time in 10 years, she prayed. I let out a last chuckle and bam, darkness. 

“Finally,” I thought. I sat in the pitch black for a few minutes, just listening to the silence. Peace at last. Then a voice appeared in my mind. I couldn’t recognize it at first until I turned around and saw my younger self. She was almost glowing. “Why are you here?”, she asked. I looked at her for a few seconds, trying to recognize the girl that I used to know. “I’d guess that you would understand when you’re older,” I answered back, not exactly knowing what to say. She stood in silence, “You know, those pills you took were strong, but depression was stronger. It really made you believe that your own sister was against you,”. She didn’t show a facial expression but the empty void around me screamed disappointment. I didn’t want to say anything. “ I’m denying your request of death, come back in another 60 years,”. Blink.

I opened my eyes to an empty hospital room. What the fuck. My sister was asleep on the chair with my old coat around her. A little alarm started playing on a machine that it seemed I was hooked up to and a few seconds later a nurse came in with an amazed look on her face. “You’re awake?”, she sort of questioned as she grabbed some equipment to check my pupils and awareness. Lilian woke up when I said “Damn,” with a flashlight pointed at my eye. “Charlotte?”, she spoke with excitement, “You’re awake”.

Turns out, I had less than a 1 percent chance to awake from my Coma. The weeks following, I went into treatment for an undiagnosed depression and anxiety that had been going on for years. I had to go to a 6-month rehab, even though I only did any sort of drug that night. A year after the incident, I was in a better state. I never really knew that if talking to my younger self was real, or an impulse dream in my coma, but I’ll never forget what little she said to me.",stories,A message from my younger self.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lr8m6s/a_message_from_my_younger_self/,1614130022.0

15,PointCrow_Simp_14,1614137359,"Late, at night, dark and cold outside. Trees blowing in the wind, the clock strikes 2. Here I am. Just staring... empty space. Just the outdoors with the rain showering down, lampposts flickering. I look out at the stormy sky, I don’t know what I’m doing here, in the real life. No purpose? No passion? What am I doing here? Why was I a thing? I don’t know who I’m supposed to be. Did I even matter to anyone? Was I even wanted? Or wasn’t I planned to be here? Just a random kid being brought to this cruel world? So many questions. I don’t know if my parents are my real parents. No similarities in looks, passion or anything. Completely the opposite. I stop pondering, thinking that I really need to sleep. I look down and I see... a man? I couldn’t tell who he was. He was taller and he was in a raincoat. Pitch black, the only thing bringing colour is the last lamppost that survived the horrid storm. I hear nothing other than the wind. I slightly open my bedroom door. Nothing. No sound, no light, no activity. I decide to rush down the stairs, on tiptoes after I open my window by 5 centimetres. I swiftly make it to the door, narrowly avoiding the cat. Evil little thing...



I grab my boots and my coat, torch in hand. I slip out as quick as I can, locking the door behind me. I walk faster and faster, catching up to the mysterious man. I call out to him. Nothing. I sprint over, 1 centimetre away from his hand. After running 5 more seconds, I finally grab a hold of his hand. It’s freezing due to the horrendous weather. He stares deeply into my eyes, clearly shocked. I then ask him, “ why are you running sir? Shouldn’t you be at home? It’s awful out.” He then has a concerned look on his face. “ You should be at home! Asleep! Your parents will be terribly worried! Quickly, don’t worry about me!” I return the same glance back at him, then suddenly... I burst into tears of distress. “ I don’t know my parents! All I know is that they are not like me at all! I’m almost certain I’m adopted! You don’t know anything about me, what it’s like to not get to know your real family... or yourself... so don’t make assumptions! I shouldn’t of come out here for you. Goodnight.” He then looks guilty... and looked into my eyes again, I did the same and i saw it. I saw the same dull eye as I’ve been seeing my whole life. The detail the same... even the colour? Could he of lost someone in his life who he never got to know? Could I finally relate to someone? He spoke more softly. “ Actually, I do know what it’s like... to not know who I am, or my family. I lost my daughter when she was born. Her mother passed due to difficulties with birth. I was already short with money, I couldn’t look after her. I regret it deeply. She had the same eyes as mine, that’s all I remember! I was so stupid to just give up, I never got to see my little angel grow up and spread her wings. I reckon she’s the same age as you. Are you 13?” I then realised... could HE be the answer! The one I was looking for? The one I was missing in my life who is alive? He looked impatient. “Y-yes. My name is Maya.” He looked stunned. Confusion overcame me. I figured it was my time to leave. “ Well I should go now... thanks for talking to me.” I turned. He grabs my hand. “ Wait, just remember... you have a meaning. I’m sure your parents love you. Biological and/or adoptive. You will know and find the purpose in your life. I know what you’re going through. Please don’t do something incredibly stupid that you will regret, and please! Don’t forget me! Thank you, goodnight.” He passes a note to me. Black, it shadows over me, the rain getting heavier and then softer again.



I’m... in my bed? Was that a dream? The window staring? The strange man? The note? “Maya! Breakfast!” I get ready, and before I look at my bed. And I see... a note? I read it. And the ruffled, wet paper is actually there!


Don’t give up! You were born for a reason. I know it. Please keep this note a secret and don’t throw it away. Remember me. You will know what you’re supposed to be. People love you! No matter what! And don’t do anything you will regret, because I will regret everything... our little secret. 



I cry, with a little smile rising on my face. It was a stupid smile, but one that was worth remembering. I put the paper under my pillow. 9 pm arrives and a picture is right in front of me. A sketch I made that took me all day. The man that helped me realise what life is all about. Life is full of surprises. I was loved! By the man, my family and... myself!

**The Lottery**

The birds were chirping, the salmon-coloured sky was beautiful, the bright sun was out, it was a perfect day.

“SCORE!” the opposing team exclaimed with joy.

That put an end to the game, both teams showed entirely different emotions. 

“Alex, Alex!” she called out cheerfully.

No response, the boy just kept walking. He didn’t take losses well, but no one expected him to go this far. His grumbles echoed throughout the barren land, stomps ruptured through the earth. A perfect day turned into a crummy one

Although despicable at moments like this, he was a bright light, for now, concealed by an overwhelming shadow.

Jeanie finally caught up, “Alex, can you stop?”

He stopped, his eyes darted to the murky puddle next to the dumpster. 

With a frown across his face, he apologized. But she could tell it was fake, insincere, and not from the depths of his heart.

She sighed “I know you don’t take losses well”

Her bright yellow sneakers walked across the puddle, down the muddy trail. 

She looked back, with a smile on her face “Let’s head home!”

They both started walking back to their neighbourhood, one upset, and one joyful. The perfect day was stained with a single soccer goal. 

The footsteps echoed through the barren land until it stopped. His shadow stood still, his footsteps came to a halt and the tension around him suddenly vanished. There was something different, unusual about him.

He looked towards the rusting, poorly maintained bandwagon, and marched towards it. Not with anger, nor joy, but with curiosity.

There was nothing special about the vehicle, it was in poor condition and seemed to be as old as time. Something sparked his interest, but Jeanie didn’t understand.

“Alex, what’s wrong with you, you are bein-”

He turned around with an annoyed look on his face, and he brought his index finger to his lips. She followed his lead, tip-toeing across the murky puddle. 

He stopped at the flat, crouching to get a better angle of the undercarriage. She didn’t see anything special about the car, she tried to see what was unique about the rustic bandwagon. She took a step back, looked at the broken windows, ripped-up seats, and the faulty engine. Still, she drew a blank, nothing popped out.  

“Alex, I am heading back,” she muttered while looking at him.

But, then she saw it. It was in plain sight, did Alex already see it?

He started picking apart the flat tire, revealing the green, rolled-up hundred-dollar bills. They both marvelled their eyes at the wonder, the day stained with a single soccer goal, suddenly turned into a perfect day again.

23,helangar1981,1614114068,"This is a crazy story I wrote back in 2003. It has been translated to English from Swedish by me.

\----

John Smith woke up with a shiver.

&amp;#x200B;

He was sweating profusely but could not think of what he had dreamed of. Suddenly he recognized it. Craving for gambling. Actually, it was not the gambling itself that drew him to constantly and evenly lose large sums on Powerball, casinos, and other gambling. It was the money that pulled. John, like most others, wanted a big house, a nice car, and lots of capital to use if there was something he wanted. But instead, he sat there, in his studio apartment in Phoenix. The only ways he could imagine getting rich quickly were either gambling or crime.

The former was obviously what he was doing right now. Crime, on the other hand, no, it was not in the family to do such things. All his ancestors, at least as far back as he could remember, had been honest and earned their living by hand. And they had not gambled either. So at one point, he was still different from them. Why should he not be allowed to deviate on other points as well? He had thought for many, long moments about this kind of thing, but still could never imagine doing anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But now this morning around four o'clock when he was sitting there cold sweaty in bed, he came up with other thoughts. He wanted to be well. He did not want to live in misery for the rest of his life with coupons strewn around him. He wanted to get rich. Very rich. And that did not happen by robbing the local convenience store. No, a bank robbery was the only thing that mattered. A coup against a suitable bank nearby. But first, he would try to fall asleep again and sleep on the thing. Tomorrow he might think about it all. How could that be? He lay for a long time thinking about it all before he could fall asleep again.

&amp;#x200B;

John woke up rested despite the night's violent awakening and insomnia to the tunes of the radio morning show. He got out of bed with newfound confidence, made himself a bowl of cereal, went to the window to peek outside. There he saw a couple of blocks of graffiti on the nearest building. But they were not annoying, they were merely decorative.

&amp;#x200B;

Halfway he stopped and scanned the area carefully. Sure enough, there were three police cars parked near a café. The area around the café was blocked and lit up by a spotlight. He turned around to go home again when the police car turned and went the opposite way. What was that all about? An officer in a uniform was looking for someone. John did not recognize the face. and went to the kitchen to cook a hearty breakfast. He ate breakfast with joy in mind. Soon he would have more money than he could ever dream of! So, breakfast was eaten, teeth brushed and the bed made. During the night he had come to the conclusion that the coup would absolutely take place. In that case, it was just a matter of finding a suitable ""object"" to plan around. He went around the suburbs, as far from his own home as possible, but still, within Phoenix, it was a city he knew with his heart.

&amp;#x200B;

He checked Encanto, Estrella with several places but finally came to the conclusion that the Chase bank in Alahambra was a suitable victim for the blow. That bank was ideal in many ways. The local police had just been subjected to savings and closed down, and no private security company had yet had time to establish itself in the area. The only type of security activity that was available was the order group ""mothers and fathers in the city"", which also only acted at night, as well as the bank's own security force. But how would they stop him? He would be heavily armed. How he would now get over the weapons… Maybe Charley Growler, an old classmate of John, could fix it. He lived in Denver for a long time, he knew that after a class reunion five or six years ago, when Charley disgraced himself after drinking a lot and then revealed that he was part of the ""Jockey Robbery"" in 1979. He probably went in lockup for ten years, John remembered. He should not be so difficult to get a hold of!

&amp;#x200B;

And guns, he had enough of that. The problem was that no one but himself would know anything about the coup, he would work alone. Maybe he would have to do more than he thought about at night after all. First and foremost, it was important to find out more about Charley in secret, and that without him realizing that something was wrong, at least at first. Maybe someone would have to commit to life for the sake of the coup. And Charley, with everything he had on his conscience, would probably be more than suitable for it. John went to the tax authority and looked a bit in the ""citizen terminals"" that were set up, and found out more than well with information.

&amp;#x200B;

Charley had no idea when he received the mail in the mailbox this beautiful Sunday morning. He now had an orderly life, he was single as usual, but out most of the time and ""looking for a woman"" as he called it. He went through today's letter harvest and discovered a pasted envelope that was strangely torn. Someone had stolen his mail, in other words. The days passed, and Charley did not think much about the letter until a few days later another torn envelope arrived. With some concern, he went to the police and reported what had happened. The chief of police greeted happily and wondered what it was all about this time. ""I have not done anything, but someone is after me"" was Charley's instinctive response to the call. The report was made, but without hope, as the police now had bigger things to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

The letters were composed by John, and the letterheads were prepared with Johnny LaCourse's fingerprints, straight from his office. John had discovered in the terminals that Charley had a huge debt to this man, and had therefore bought a variety of envelopes which he sent to Johnny's office, with various offers of free office envelopes in editions of two thousand pieces. Johnny had not been able to resist this offer but flipped through the envelopes a few times to find out which one he wanted to receive. The condition for the deal was strangely enough that you would return all the envelopes in a stamped envelope and this Johnny did. He never received any envelopes, but John received something he needed; a large collection of envelopes tainted with Johnny's fingerprints. It was these envelopes he now terrorized Charley with, by sealing them again, of course not with his own saliva, and sent them opened.

&amp;#x200B;

John looked at Charley from a distance as he picked up his mail, and he could not help but to enjoy himself when he saw how unhappy Charley was every time he discovered one of the opened envelopes. He also had reason to feel unhappy. This was the day it was going to happen. John had planned the whole coup for a few months, and this was just one of the steps that had to be performed for the well-being of the coup. He almost regarded the coup as something alive nowadays, an organism with tentacles that not only extends into his life but needs to extend throughout society. The organism had to be cared for and taken care of, and he, John, had been given that task. He even felt love for it. In any case, the next step was to execute Charley, and this in a very bestial way. It had to be done that way, to give the organism the satisfaction it needed.

&amp;#x200B;

John snuck into Charley's garden the following night and opened the back door with the key under the flowerpot. He had discovered this during his reflections on Charley. Charley lay asleep peacefully in his bed, and John made an effort not to wake him. His weapons must be hidden somewhere. He finally found them or at least thought he could find them, in a locked cupboard in the basement. No matter how he looked for the key, he could not find it. He simply had to ask Charley for it. Carefully he crept up the stairs, and into the bedroom where Charley was dreaming. He lifted Charley's pillow, and there really was a gun. He took it and put it in the waistband. He carefully put a bandage around Charley's mouth, and then took his magnificent hunting knife, bought at Wal-Mart last Christmas, and put the blade against Charley's neck. He shook Charley who woke up with a jerk, a jerk that caused him a small injury to the neck. Charley looked at him for a fraction of a second with horror-mixed fatigue, after which he lay pressed against the pillow, stiff with fear.

&amp;#x200B;

“Where are the other weapons? I know you have more""

&amp;#x200B;

Charley did not make a sound, partly because of the bandage, partly because of the fear.

&amp;#x200B;

""YOU HAVE MORE WEAPONS AND I WILL FUCKING HAVE THEM""

&amp;#x200B;

Charley nodded gently and tried to get up. Together they went down to the basement and opened the weapons cabinet, it was unlocked. Damn it, John figured and put everything in a bag, after he paralyzed Charley with a blow to the back.

&amp;#x200B;

He dragged Charley out to the car, luckily his house was a bit out in the countryside and no neighbors' watchful eyes saw what was going on. He put Charley in the trunk and the weapons in the back seat, funny, he laughed to himself, his friend in the luggage, and the weapons in the back seat. He drove south for several hours, and at the height of Green River he took off on a detour. Here he had built the croft, outwardly a small timber shed, but built almost entirely of concrete and stone. Inside, it was about 150 square feet, and the only interior was chain fittings connected to blocks and hoists in the walls, and some chains and pieces of metal on the floor and walls. He had got it so nice, he thought to himself, and nature, yes it was certainly something else up here in the countryside! He lit the kerosene lamps and candles and carried Charley in from his luggage. Charley was still not conscious. He hooked Charley up with some difficulty in the hooks on the wall and hoisted him up so he hung where he wanted him.

&amp;#x200B;

""Mhmmm-hmmmmmmmm-mmm!""

&amp;#x200B;

""So you've woken up now?!""

&amp;#x200B;

John cut off the bandage from Charley

&amp;#x200B;

“What the hell is this, my back hurts, and… what the FUCK is this? Where am I? And John? Is this some kind of joke or not?""

&amp;#x200B;

Hearing about the organism's order as a joke was too much, nothing could stop him now. He picked up one of the chains from the floor, and with a flick, he slammed it right over Charley's belly, Charley screaming out his pain and agony.

&amp;#x200B;

He kept going, beating and beating, Charley screamed and screamed and John roared with pleasure. Finally, there was nothing more than blood, tendons, and bones hanging on the wall. The roar had been silent for a few minutes now as if faded out in time with the beats. John cut Charley down from the wall, left the corpse lying, and went home, well equipped with new weapons and an enemy less to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks passed, and the articles about the missing Charley became fewer and fewer, no one was looking for him, he had just disappeared. The police thought he had chosen to move abroad, and had just broken with everything. However, they had tried to secure some evidence of his disappearance at Charley's home, and found, among other things, a large stack of opened envelopes.

&amp;#x200B;

John sat and enjoyed another breakfast, today it was time to harvest another sacrifice for the benefit of the organism. He had carefully selected a victim, and this time it was time to take on the young cashier at his local grocery store. He had systematically mapped her life for a few days and knew when she went home from work and so on. He did not really want to do that, but at the same time, he felt that the organism's orders were clear this time. He simply had to.

&amp;#x200B;

Her name was Jennifer. She had only worked at the grocery store for six months and planned to start studying in the autumn. She did her job very well, and she earned well, so really there was no reason to quit. But she wanted to see something different in life and had therefore applied for and got admitted to the college in Salt Lake City. She and her only remaining family, her father, were to go on a tour of a private student apartment tomorrow morning, it was a long way to go from Phoenix to Green River, but it was worth it if you wanted something proper. The guy who rented out sounded so nice on the phone, she had thought, and he would meet them in Green River. Early the next morning they were off on their trip.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a lovely morning in Green River, John had gone up the day before and set up a wardrobe in the croft, where he threw in the remaining remnants of Charley, yes, it was just sludge now. He had then cleaned out as best he could, and then prepared the croft, which was windowless, with a large number of perfume balls.

It led to the day when Jennifer and her father came to the square in Green River, where they were greeted by a happy guy.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello, are you going to look at the apartment?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, we are very happy that it was so quick to find something!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, it's difficult today, we all need a home, and my apartment is a bit outside of town, in a forest area, that's why I do not take more than 120 bucks a month""

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, it's a fantastic price! Shall we drive after in the car? ""

&amp;#x200B;

""We can go with me""

&amp;#x200B;

They went out to the croft together, and John had cut the grass outside, so according to him it looked really homely. From the outside in any case. Jennifer's dad mentioned something about it looking like a small cottage, how cozy, while Jennifer sounded a little more skeptical. But John hardly heard it, now he fully enjoyed what was to come. They went into the cottage after John, who stood in the doorway.

&amp;#x200B;

“What a smell! Lemon - or what kind of scent is it? ""

&amp;#x200B;

""I have tried to make it as nice as possible""

&amp;#x200B;

""But - there are no windows""

&amp;#x200B;

""No, there are no windows. Goodbye."" John said, slamming the door shut.

&amp;#x200B;

He locked carefully with the beam outside, and then closed it again with the heavy steel door. Then he covered the shed as best he could with spruce twigs and went home. He would not return until after a few weeks, he laughed to himself.

&amp;#x200B;

The weeks passed and became two months. John became more and more excited to see how things had gone for Jennifer and her father. The newspapers still wrote quite a lot about their sudden disappearance, and the police said they had secured some clues. Impossible, John thought and had another breakfast. He had been thinking for a few days about who the next victim would be and came to the conclusion that he might try to find someone around Green River. Well, first he wanted to see how things had gone in the croft. He would probably drive at night and have a sleepover in the croft, it could be cozy to see what happened to the autumn rush, which had now begun to appear. It was mid-September, and the leaves lay like a carpet over the croft. He carefully opened the door, quietly and cautiously, just as if he did not want to wake those who slept inside. The sight that met him was macabre, but it still aroused some joy in him. The walls were full of traces, which Jennifer and her father must have made after a few days. Only Jennifer's father laid like a rotten corpse on the floor, of Jennifer and Charley only the gnawed bone knots remained.

&amp;#x200B;

The father, whom John never asked for his name, must have eaten his own daughter. Together they had well consumed the half-rotten remnants of Charley, and only the organism knew, what they had suffered! John felt with joy in her heart how he took the life of these existences in a very macabre way. It was early in the morning, and he was going to spend the night in the croft, so it was time to go out and get provisions.

It tasted great with fresh meat. He slept well among the bones.",stories,John's Croft,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lqsxo4/johns_croft/,1614085268.0

Ashlyn smiles and says,"" C'mon girl, we gotta find the one behind this plot."" As they walk down the old stairs, making a creak with every step. a crash fills their ears. A female in black leather with a biker helmet runs for the door. The biker pulls out an Uzi and sprays at Ashlyn, grazing her leg. As she hits the floor, Ashlyn unloads two rounds into the woman's leg. She falls down, grasping her leg. Ashlyn limps over to the biker and kicks her helmet off. A decayed, rotting face looks back with piercing yellow eyes. Ashlyn groans in disgust as the goon laughs, stating,"" Immortality and Beauty don't always mix."" Ashlyn holds a knife to the goons throat, demanding,"" Who sent your rotted, pale ass?!"" The biker pulls out a knife and swings at Ashlyn. Ashlyn dodges the attack and slams the door on the biker's head, crushing it. A male voice says over a radio,"" Sky? Did you get her?""  Ashlyn kicks the door open, wincing in the process before spotting a second biker. The second one, armed with a shotgun, aims and fires at her.

Ashlyn says,"" If you won't talk, then Cerberus can eat you. Have at him, girls."" The triplets maul the biker to death, tearing his eyes and fingers off. Ashlyn smiles at the bloodfest in front of her while still pondering the name given at the graveyard. 



Maine:


In the furthest North of the States, another castle sits, one bigger than its partner in New York. It sits on a hill, overlooking an old military graveyard. Along the path, two large parking lots, full of expensive cars, showing that its owner is bad at money management. Inside, a lavish dining hall, filled with oil paintings of relatives. At the head of the table, a portrait of Mary Shelley. Left of the table, a staircase leading up. At the top, a study filled with books on biology, anatomy, and much more. A burly man walks in, holding a tablet. The man at the desk, a young man in his mid 30's, dressed in a white shirt and grey vest. His hair is spiked and messy, his mustache ungroomed, a monocle hazardously placed over his left eye. The burly man says,"" Doctor, Alvin failed to report in, so did Felix and Sky."" The doctor stops writing his notes and looks up, saying,"" Thank you, Angus. Inform Ernest that his services are needed."" Angus asks,"" Is that all, Doctor  Frankenstein?"" He replies,"" No, that is all, thank you."" Angus walked out, radioing to Ernest. 



Ashlyn returns to the bunker, cleaning her wound. Zoe asks,"" Did you find the mad doctor?"" Ashlyn replies in an annoyed tone,"" No, all I found was 6 of his goons. 5 of them had to be put down with head trauma. They still didn't react to pain unless it was their head."" Caimio asks,"" Do you want my findings on the female victim from the graveyard?"" Ashlyn nods yes and follows Caimio. He pulls back the sheet, exposing the body in all its glory, or lack thereof. After getting past the prospect of looking at a nude corpse, Ashlyn noticed that much of the body had stitching done to it. She asked,"" Why is it like that? That looks nothing like the monster in the movie."" Caimio pulls up a picture of the monster and says,"" That's because what you're looking at isn't the flathead monster played by Boris Karloff, this is a real case of man-made humans, or what I assume is a person who kept avoiding death. If you mortals would take the time to read, you'd find that in the book version, Victor doesn't dig up graves, he uses parts that were never alive. Like the Golem in Jewish lore. For some reason, this young lady was assembled from various scrapped remains."" Ashlyn asks,"" If she's been rebuilt, how was she alive? Did the creator use human hearts?"" Caimio pulls out a human heart with glowing spores on it. Ashlyn says,"" Why does that look like magic? That wasn't in the book."" Caimio replies,"" This is what was powering this woman, the man had wires attached to his. Did you see the faces of the goons in New York?"" Ashlyn replies,"" Yeah, I saw them. This one girl looked like she died in the 1970s. Her face was all rotten and fleshy. I legit wanted to vomit. Her head also caved in easily and Cerberus picked off the man she was with. His head was fine but had some resemblance."" Caimio said,"" Are you suggesting mother and son?"" She replies,"" The age matched so maybe."" Caimio's computer went off, showing a police report of grave robbery. He said,"" Well that's odd. These two were the victims of grave robbery back in the 80s."" Ashlyn asked,"" Did they die then?"" Caimio replies,"" Yeah, the report says that they just went missing."" The woman's arm started twitching, looking for a weapon. Caimio crushed it, saying,"" That's fucked up. The man's arm did the same. Someone programmed these things to keep working."" Ashlyn says,"" If you're done with them, burn them. That might put them down for good. In the meantime, I'm going with Zoe to find out who sent them."" She walked out and asked,"" Hey, hon? You wanna go hunt some Frankenstein's?"" Zoe sighs and responds,"" Sure, but don't tell Alli, she'd lose it."" Castiel returns from his trip and says,"" The bodies at the Castle are related. I felt it in their blood."" Zoe asks,"" Wait, does that mean someone's family is behind this?"" Castiel replies,"" I'm not sure. Seeing as the bodies were all human, I think we can rule out Tsunami. Strangely, the memories of the dead were gone, like someone erased them or that they never existed."" Zoe says,"" I guess we got hunting to do...""

25,DekDeki,1614099272,"I was on the bus when I noticed a little girl sitting in her mother's arms not far from me. Holding on to the handrails in the bus, I walked a little closer.
At first glance, it was just a cute curly-haired child in a pink hat with a pompom and a winter jacket, but when she turned her face in my direction, I noticed a little interest.
I smiled back, wanting to encourage her face, which looked sad, but when she saw me, she immediately turned away from me, disappointed and cold, and completely lost interest.

Her mother and she drove very quietly and they hardly moved. And even though her jacket was buttoned up in the heated bus, she didn't move or try to discuss anything with her mother, just looking straight ahead.

I noticed small cuts on the hands of this child, about 4 or 6 years old, before she turned her head towards the window and a loud cold cry was heard from her:
""Stop turning your head! Sit tight! I'm tired, stop pointing that at me right now!""
And then she hit the pompom on her daughter's hat.

The little girl tried to move closer to the front seats, but again hit her mother in the face, causing even more screams and no one but me looked in their direction most people just silently turned away from them.

After a few minutes, the screams, during which the girl only silently and without tears looked wearily ahead of her, stopped. There was a deathly silence on the bus.

After a couple of stops, the girl got off her mother's lap, took her by the sleeve and led the woman, who was leaning heavily towards her daughter and again shouting loudly, away from the bus.

The door closed and I saw for the last time the cold, haggard expression on her face.

I live in the Philippines.
The Philippines always has problems with police, corruption, the government, and most importantly pedophilia.

This happened around 2 months ago, 10 days before Christmas.
I went outside with a small, but sharp butterfly knife
Mainly because there have been reports of men in motorcycles stealing your stuff.
I went outside to buy some things, then i saw my friend with this old man. 

The old man looked around 50 or something and was a foreigner, which was uncommon. 
I was worried since the old man just walked up to my friend and started talking to him. 
I didn't intervene in the conversation but i watched. 
I watched silently. 

They talked for like 30 minutes or something and after that, they crossed the street. 
I was suspicious, i followed but i didn't make it look obvious

The old man held my friend's (who is 9) hand tightly and he clearly didn't like that. 
It looked like he was being forced and harrased by this creep so i intervened. 

I walked up to him and i ask him what is he doing. 
He replied with ""none of your business"" 
Then proceeded to forcefully push my friend in the back of the car. 

I immediately try to push the old man out of the way. 
He replied with ""what are you doing with my son!? Are you a kidnapper or something?"" 

I know my friend for years, i was there when he was born. Heck, i even offered to become his Ninong (a filipino thing). I know his parents, this old man wasn't his parent nor his grandparent nor his uncle or whatever. 

I replied with"" yeah, sure. His parents are literally my neighbors. And you are not his parents""
I then proceeded to carry my friend out of the car. 

He then pushed me to the ground and grabbed my friend and put him in the pasesenger seat. 
He then went on to the driver's seat and tried to scram. 

I was fortunately close to his car when he pushed me. So i got up as fast as i could and went straight to the driver seat window. 
Obviously, i grabbed my knife. I stabbed him
Its the first time i stabbed someone with the knife that i had for years. 
I stabbed him in the shoulder twice. I was gonna stab his neck, but then the other bystanders got in and broke it up. 

Police came, i told the police that the old guy was about to kidnap my friend. I then called the parents. 
The parents then said that they are not related nor know the old man. 

Police confiscated my knife but didn't put any charges on me. 
The old guy however, got charged with attempted kidnapping and assault. 

I swear to god, i was gonna kill this man without regret. Jail or not, he deserves to die in my eyes",stories,"I nearly killed a pedophile, I'm mad that i didn't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lqmvg8/i_nearly_killed_a_pedophile_im_mad_that_i_didnt/,1614070005.0

On the night before the final, he studied so long that he overslept the morning of the test. He was 20 minutes late for the class and of course missed the beginning.

He looked at the blackboard and saw 3 equations .  
 ‘It must be the hometask for the next time’ - he thought.  
He silently wrote down all 3 equations. 2 of those were quite simple, but the last one required more time and efforts.

He came home and spent a couple of days and even nights thinking about the solution for the third task. Finally he got the solution and passed it to the professor.  
The next Sunday, in the early morning, somebody rang at the door. George and his wife Ann were not expecting any guests. 

That was the professor.   
“You were only supposed to do only the first two equations,” the professor explained. “That last one was an example of an equation that mathematicians in the whole world have been trying to solve with no success. The last one was the unsolvable math problem, and NO ONE knew how to solve it. I discussed it with the class before starting the test.  And you just solved it!”

Though, George didn’t know that the problems were unsolvable and he missed the beginning of the class when the professor explained the story behind this equation.  
If George had known that the problems were not homework but were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics, he probably would not have thought positively, would have become discouraged, and would never have solved them.",stories,TRUE story: Student that was 20 minutes late for the class and made the professor SHOCKED.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lqmspi/true_story_student_that_was_20_minutes_late_for/,1614069822.0

But he wasn't in the pram this morning.
The blanket was neatly folded in an empty space, the suit was still on the table, but my Shrek was gone!
I cried for a very long time and asked my parents and grandmother, but since the morning no one even came to my room.

---------.

I was at the bus stop. It was raining a lot and I didn't have anything to cover myself with so I was completely wet as it was raining on me. 

All of a sudden, a girl with brown hair, probably around my age, came closer and gave me an red umbrella saying: ""Take this! I have two. If I were in your situation I'd be praying for this to happen!""

I initially refused for courtesy, but she was super nice and insisted that I took it, so in the end I did. I remained there completely blown away by the amount of kindess I had just received. 

I smiled and my bus arrived right after. It's just a bus every hour so I jumped on without thinking too much about it. Doors close, and I still have the umbrella with me. I give a look outside to at least apologize to her with my eyes, even if I'm 100% sure she wanted me to keep the umbrella, and she's gone. There's nobody but a bald man with a blue umbrella standing there, and she's not of the bus either.

I immediately regretted jumping on that bus. She was an angel and I didn't deserve it.

32,YeahBoi772,1614092035,"To give some context. 

This happened a few years ago. I'm a boy  I was staying a few weeks at my Aunt. She doesn't have a husband or kids. I'm an only child. My parent both had to go out of the state for work. I was around 7 years old. At the time I was very small. Smaller than normal people I had the size of a 4 year old. I am now a lot bigger no worries XD. I did not mind staying with my Aunt for a few weeks. Because she is a very nice lady. I arrive at my Aunts house. She's a pretty rich lady. She has a big house and a lot of rooms.

The first day goes fine! We stay up late watching a movie. This is when the weird happened. We ate a lot of candy. My aunt gave me some sleeping pills without me knowing she said it was ""candy"". I of course took the pills. After a while I feel very tired. This is the part that's very vague to me. She  probably changed my clothes around that time. She put me in some kind of bed. I still kept sleeping.

When I was younger I had very real dreams that's probably because I have a very big fantasy. I woke up and wanted to get out of bed. But the pills weakened a lot of my muscles. I had very long hair like girl hair. I had a wig attached to me with a hairband so I count take it off. I was also wearing a my little pony shirt. I was in a pink room with girl toys and such. This is were my stupid brain came to play. I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING! I cried so I could get the attention of my aunt. She came into the room in very different clothes and a lot of make up. This was her plan all along. She made me her child! 

But stupid young me didn't know that and still thought I was dreaming... She put me in her arms and began to sing something. I don't remember what because I forgot. I kept crying. Because all my muscles were really weak like she planned. She put me in one of those baby box thingies. And she gave me some milk out of one of those bottles. The room changed entirely. She grabbed some other clothes for me. They were of course pink (What would you expect). She changed my clothes and put a diaper on me. She put me in a Pram and walked me outside. I really had to poop but I couldn't get a word out of my mouth. She took me to some shops and bought some toys for me. She keeps doing these things for a few days. My muscles weren't paralyzed anymore. The longer this went on the longer I forgot my old life. 

Luckily my parents came to pick me up. And told my aunt to f up and that we would never talk to her again.

So we now still don't talk to my aunt. She did sent me a letter saying if I wanted to play again I could message her. I of course declined

that's it!

34,Godess777,1614081084,"Backstory - Basically this teacher has no shame. Basically if a child tattled on another kid for saying something inappropriate she would handle it strangely, however if she witnessed it she’d go berserk. Okay, it’s common knowledge that kids make mistakes especially little kids like ones that are only in grade 2, whether the mistakes were on purpose or not. But apparently children making mistakes is new too that teacher for whatever reason. 

So the first incident what I did I don’t suggest doing if your a kid and what I did was wrong, but to be fair me being a kid with Mild Autism I didn’t really understand social cues back the when I was in Grade 2, whenever I’d hear new phrases that were new too me that sounded inappropriate I’d go ‘WAIT THATS ILLEGAL.’. Too be fair, what I did was wrong. 

But continuing on, I was walking in class I don’t  know what I was doing but while I was in the room, I heard one of my class mates say ‘bare lady’s bottom’ I told on them. Yes, tattletaling is bad, but that’s not all. So I go to the teacher and tell her about what happened. Naturally, the teacher told them to stay in after class to discuss it. Honestly, after I told her I felt bad for doing it, but then what really baffled me was when the teacher said that they’ll stay in after class for the rest of the week. WHAT?! What’s even worse is that the fact that I tattled on someone went over her head. 

You think that was strange? Another time, it didn’t involve snitching, but this time she ‘witnessed’ it (not really, she just heard one thing and misunderstood.) I and a few classmates were having a conversation. One classmate goes to the other about a lady being shot somewhere in the private of her body (okay maybe I got the shooting part wrong but I do remember the lady and the private parts bit). I wanted to join in the conversation, and I go to them. “Which one?” The other kid goes: “What one?” So I ask in a way he could understand. “Which private part do you mean? Was it the bottom or her chest?” So the other kid naturally answers, but the teacher cut him off after she only just arrived to us obviously not knowing the full story (which was just rude). “HEY DON’T TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS IN CLASS! I’m calling your mum!” Then when she goes to the phone box, she goes to the other classmates I was talking to. “GO SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE NOW!” Then when they leave the one that started the conversation says my name to me in a condescending manner showing his disappointment to me. What’s even worse is that the teacher didn’t even need to do that, what she needed was to chill. 

Also, calling my mum was pretty unnecessary because the class had a 3 part chart (the first part for good behaviour, second for having detention for doing something silly, and third for calling parents if so bad) and the students had pegs with their names on them recording there performance in class. Not only that, but what really baffled me was when she called my mum over something she overheard me and another kid talk about, but when I snitched on a group of kids she only gives them a talk after class.

36,TreadmillTreats,1614079819,"The incredible gift of friendship

I say all the time that I am blessed with wonderful friends, that one person shouldn't have this many friend's and yet I do. I have had friends I've known since I was 5 years old, friends I went all through school with and friends I've met when I started my life in Florida.

I remember when I was married and my ex made me choose between him or my friends. Being young and stupid, I chose him because I was afraid of losing him and it felt like I lost a part of my soul. For years he kept me away from my friends because he knew they would see right through him and tell me to open my eyes. 

As I found myself again, I found my friends again and they helped me through some of my darkest days. They encouraged me, supported me, gave me a shoulder to cry on and even after, time and time again when I didn't take their advice about freeing myself from this marriage, they were still there for me.

They have been there in good times and bad, in hard times and smooth sailing. They made me laugh and cried with me. They taught me who I truly was because they loved me for who I was, and they taught me the lesson of always being yourself, being true to yourself.

I remember when I realized how much my friends were there for me, it was when I bought my own home. It was then that I realized how truly blessed I was, when I saw how many friends came to my need to help me. Especially when I first got divorced and moved out and then and then with the new home I bought.
I had friends that flew in from all across the country for my 50th birthday, friends that flew in to help me with my new home and when I was finally done remodeling and moving into my new home, friends that flew in to make me a surprise housewarming party. I was blown away each and every time to know I have these incredible friends. 

Most people are lucky enough to get maybe one or two friends in their lives, and yet I have all of these friends that I am so grateful for. Friends I've had for decades, friends I've had as long as I can remember and new friends that I meet along the way. 

So today my friends I want to thank all of my amazing friends who went above and beyond the word friendship to become the family I chose for myself and to say that words could never express what I feel for you all.
I am truly blessed each and every day that you are in my life, I love you all.
I am grateful for each and every one of you!

And for my readers out there, please know that when times are hard you have someone to lean on, someone who has your back, they are called your friends. 

""Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for"" 

""Be the change you want to see""

You know what happens when you give a kid no older than 10 an ak and tell him to shoot at the white folk?
[he harshly throws his smoldering cigarette to the ground, stomping it with his bloodied boots]
Horrors you couldn’t even fucking fathom. These marines, these people who have been broken down into little pieces of dust and built back up and told to kill, I’ve seen some think twice about shooting them and others not even giving em quick death. No, they’d shoot for the lungs, shoot to wound, shoot to fucking make em suffer. Today when I watched this, I immediately grabbed the kid and carried him to the bird that got us out. I saw him see us, barely pull the rifle up, and pull the trigger. Nothing happened. And this stupid asshole shot him. Right then and there I pulled my pistol out, 
[he draws his 1911, cocks the hammer, and aims it down the field]
Slammed the guys skull, and shoved the barrel down his throat while telling others to pick up the kid. I said to him,”I ever see you do that again, I will personally send you home in a bucket wearing your asshole as a hat, do you “fucking understand me?” He shook his head, pissing his pants. I holstered my weapon and carried the kid to the black Hawk. He’s stable, but I’m not going anywhere until he’s ok.

2022, Pennsylvania at a local graveyard. A man and a woman, both clad in brown suits, attempt to dig up a body. The moon is still full, a sign of the tomfuckery that exists in this world. The woman hits a coffin and drags the old-ass coffin out of the ground. The man rips the coffin open and picks up the corpse. A gun cock sends the woman reaching for her revolver. A female voice says,"" Drop it or I let the dogs on you."" The woman says,"" What the?"" A small girl leaps on the woman and pins her to the ground. A brown-haired girl with black leather walked over. Zoe said,"" Good girl, Cerberus. Now send the other 2 to fetch."" The blonde Cerberus whistled, sending the brown and black-haired ones running after the man.  The man is pinned down, he groans in anger. Ashlyn walks over, holding a shotgun. She kneels down and says,"" You aren't the first grave robber we've fought, but something tells me you're after more than just wealth."" The brunette and black-haired Cerberus chew on the man's leg, ripping it off. Ashlyn says,"" Great! Now you've killed the... Wait, why is he not screaming?"" Cerberus #3 yelps as she spits out the leg before trying to get the taste out. Cerberus #2 sniffs the man and looks at Ashlyn, whining in concern. Ashlyn shoots the man in the leg, getting no reaction. Zoe brings the woman over with Cerberus #1 crawling next to her. Zoe says,"" What in the hell is that thing?"" Cerberus #1 says,"" Zombie?"" Ashlyn replies,"" Whatever they are, they won't be alive much longer. I can assure you that."" The Cerberus triplets keep the woman cornered while Zoe and Ashlyn investigate the man. The man says,"" What? Little wolf can't do what a human can? Shame, I thought your kind was superior."" Ashlyn stomped his head in, killing him. As the boot left the crushed head, the skin and flesh decayed rapidly. Ashlyn aims her shotgun at the woman's head, asking,"" What's the body for?"" The woman replies,"" A special project led by dear Uncle Victor, bringing life to nothing and something at the same time."" Ashlyn shot the woman in the head, blasting her brains apart. Zoe said,"" What does that mean?"" Ashlyn replies in a nervous tone,"" We're gonna need some help with this one...""






Act 1: The Making Of A Monster:




Back in the bunker, Ashlyn paces back and forth nervously. Zoe has Caimio examine the body of the grave robbers. Cerberus walks in, each playing with a bone. Caimio walks in, the same concerned expression that Ashlyn had. He says,"" You're lucky that you went for the head. Those two weren't mortal. The DNA didn't even match. There were parts of 6 people in that lab. Someone built a human..."" Cerberus whimpers in fear, knocking a book off of the shelf. Ashlyn grabs it and notices it is Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. She says,"" Caimio, do a background check on the bodies, keyword, Frankenstein."" Caimio plugs it in and pulls up a result in New York. Zoe asks,"" Are you saying that Victor Frankenstein is real and wants us dead? If so, I'm out."" Ashlyn says,"" Wait, what? You aren't coming?"" Zoe replies,"" I've seen some freaky shit, but fighting a Hollywood monster isn't my idea of a hunt. I'll see you when you get back."" 




Act 2: Book Meets Reality:




Ashlyn drives to the Frankenstein estate in Upstate New York. Cerberus looks around as the trees slowly lose color, looking more and more decayed. Cerberus #2 says,"" Scary..."" Ashlyn replies,"" I know, girl. I know."" As they reach a turn in the road, a guard holding a rifle stops them. The guard says,"" Are you the one with the demon dog triplets?"" Ashlyn nods yes. The guard signals to the gate operator who opens the gate. They drive forward, past a pair of graveyards. Strangely, none of the graves have names. Ashlyn parks in front of a large, European-esqe mansion, topped off with gargoyles. She gets the triplets out and they walk towards the large spruce door. She knocks and waits for the door to open. A man in a butler's outfit opens the door and says,"" Greetings, Madam. Well to Frankenstein Castle, the master will see you in the lab."" Ashlyn brings Cerberus inside. They walk up a staircase clad in velvet carpets, paintings of relatives on the wall. Ashlyn draws her pistol and peaks in at the lab. Inside, a girl chained to the wall, next to her, a man. Inside are also 3 assistants, all clad in doctor robes. The butler charges at Ashlyn with a knife, knocking her inside. The burly lab hand grabs a cleaver and tries killing her. Ashlyn snaps the neck of the bullet before shooting the buff assistant in the head. The female assistant grabs a shotgun and blasts the buff one accidentally. Ashlyn shoots the female in the head, killing her. The final assistant, a blonde, grabs a knife and swings at Ashlyn, nipping her shoulder. She knocks him down, breaking his leg. She grabs him and pins him on the wall, yelling,"" What are you doing?!"" The man says,"" It's beyond your mortal mind. You still think you're a righteous protector. The truth is that you're nothing, a speck of dust about to be vacuumed. Long live the Frankenstein Family!!"" He bites his tooth, breaking a capsule of cyanide and committing suicide. Standing in a room of corpses, Ashlyn looks around, taking in the carnage. Cerberus walked in, whimpering and nuzzling Ashlyn's leg. Ashlyn says,"" It's not over girl, not yet.""

48,AquaChad96,1614040168,"There’s an urban legend, common in many cities around the world that tells of a special market where peculiar items can be purchased. While it goes by many names, it is most commonly known as the Night Market.

According to the legend, there is a door to the Night Market in almost every city, the tricky part is finding it. While there are many different reports on how to locate the Door, they all share a few traits. It is always in an obscure, public place. Sometimes, it’s in an abandoned shopping center, or it’s a random door in a hotel. On rare occasions, the door may even be in the middle of a large empty field. No matter where the door is, it will always look the same; an ancient, weathered door carved with images of the moon and stars. 

During most hours of the day, the door will be locked, impossible to open or destroy by any means. Reports say that it can only be opened if you are alone, and if it is between 12:00 am and 3:00 am. 

Once you enter through the door, you will be met with a large antique shop unlike any other. Objects ranging from the mundane to the incomprehensible fill the shops many shelves and display cases. The following is a list of some of the more interesting items that patrons have supposedly gotten from the Night Market:
* A photograph, supposedly taken and lost years ago by the buyer.
*  A “universe in a jar”
* A pair of cardboard glasses with green and yellow lenses labeled with the words “4D glasses” on its arms 
* A taxidermy of a creature resembling a monkey with gills, webbed hands, and the tail of a fish. A plaque upon the base that the creature is mounted on labels it as a “Sea Monkey”
*  A McHotDog
* A skeleton key, capable of fitting and unlocking any lock 

As you explore the vastness that is the Night Market, you are bound to stumble upon the owner of the establishment, a strange figure only known as the Tradesmen by visitors. All descriptions of the Tradesman are the same; a large, hunched figure in a rough brown robe and skeletal hands, with tiny, beetle like eyes that peer from a ragged hood. While no one has heard it speak, it can understand any language spoken to it, and will attempt to aid visitors in finding items that interest them and demonstrating what said items do. 

Once you have found an item that you wish to purchase, the Tradesman will produce a scrap of parchment and a quill from its robe. It will then write out a price upon the parchment, and present it to you. You might as well leave your wallet at home, as money is useless in the Night Market. All purchases are done through trade. The Tradesman can ask for a myriad of things from you, ranging from regular items such as a photo of your family or a live goldfish, to more metaphysical things such as a happy memory or your time. If you agree to the exchange, and bring back the item that the Tradesman requests, it will produce a contract from its robe, written in a language no one is yet to identify. You must sign the contract in order to finalize the deal. Be wary, as the Tradesman accepts no refunds. Whatever you give in exchange at the Night Market can not be taken back easily.

There are a few rules that must be followed at all times while within the Night Market in order to ensure your safety.  
1. Do not touch anything. Ask for assistance before handling any objects 
2. Do not speak to any other patrons within the Night Market
3. Do not enter any door that isn’t the one you came through
4. DO NOT STEAL ANYTHING from the Night Market. The Tradesman will know, and he will find you.",stories,The Night Market,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lq4hvg/the_night_market/,1614011368.0

50,Mrdollarjoint,1614034368,"The wastes were unforgiving, I thought as I shoveled dirt over my best friends grave. Tears intermingling with sweat as I tamped down a shovelful and tossed the implement aside.

I sat down, the glass bottles of medicine and painkillers in my cooler satchel clinking lightly.

I remembered a line from a movie way back when called hacksaw ridge “the world seems so desperate to tear itself apart, it doesn’t seem to bad to wanna put a little bit of it back together.”

I couldn’t remember the quote verbatim but it’s what made me sign up for this mission. 

Two weeks ago, a company of American soldiers lost contact in the Oregon wastes. Their mission, simply find unmutated plant life for crops.

I was shaken from my thoughts as our groups leader set a cold bottle of water against my neck.

I took it and drained a couple gulps before standing back up and saying “let’s go, I can’t do anything more for him” though it broke my heart to say.

Cassias, our leader was a tough man, not very book smart but knew survival like it was second nature. I wiped my eyes as I sling myself resignedly into the passenger seat of our side by side.

Clara got in behind me, her scar 17 sliding into its scabbard on the top of the roll cage. I waited for tommy to get in, then remembered the wooden cross not ten feet away. The light clatter of his dogtags as they blew in the breeze, wrapped around the cross section.

Cassias got in the drivers seat and started the growling machine, putting it into gear and taking us swiftly down the shattered pavement towards the near demolished city.

“Med... you okay?” Clara asked quietly, she was always kind to me, even when I didn’t want kindness.

I shook my head and replied “no, Clara, I just had my best friend since middle school die in front of me”

She didn’t respond but I heard her sit back and start fiddling with her dog tags. 

I opened my backpack which sat between my legs and pulled out my sat phone.

The cold numbness inside me as I dialed Tommy’s mom.  I listened while it rang, composing myself.

“Hello Jason, hows Tommy doing?” Janet asked, blissfully unaware.

I stayed silent for a moment until a flood of sadness made me speak in a cracked voice.

“Tommy... isn’t coming home...”

In a second I relived yesterday’s most painful moment.

*watching the camp with Tommy, joking and dicking around as the fire in the torn open warehouse burnt down. It happened so quick, he was looking at me, asking a question about my gear when I heard the unmistakable sound of a gunshot close by. In horror I watched Tommy jerk, clutching his neck as bright crimson leaked through his fingers.*

*i dove into action, bulling out a thick gauze bandage and pulling his hand away, way too easily and I suddenly knew why. The front of his throat was torn open and over the sound of Clara and cassias’ gun fire I heard his final breath, an awful, gurgling breath that never left his lungs.*

I heard gentle sobbing and a hesitant question “was it painless,quick?”

I choked a little, it was quick but it was far from painless. Finally I choked the words out “yes... he, he didn’t feel anything”

I felt her sadness through the phone as she said goodbye and hung up.

I pulled the phone from my ear and folded the antenna down. That feeling of void nothing taking over.

I looked up just as cassias swerved to avoid hitting a small little girl, and ran right over a land mine.

The side by side was tossed, I flew from my seat, clutching my bag and satchel to my chest. Until I smacked into the ground and lost consciousness.

I woke up minutes later and sat up to look on in watered down disgust as a group of locals converged on my groups limp forms.

They were disfigured and mutated from radiation and inbreeding, vestigial limbs and extra organs could be counted from where I sat. I quietly checked the vials in my satchel making sure they weren’t shattered.

I slowly got to one knee and pulled my 1911 from its holster on the side of my bag.

I watched a local reach for Clara’s face as she started to stir, a red hot burning emotion rising in my throat like caustic bile. I screamed at the top of my lungs

“GET AWAY FROM THEEEEEEM!!”

I stood, as they turned and took two carefully aimed shots.

A local with three arms fell, bleeding from its face, the others leading a screaming charge towards me.

I didn’t turn and run like instinct told me, I fished a scalpel from my pocket and screamed back as I charged forward.

My pistol bucked, raising gouts of blood and bringing one down, my slide locked back just as the seven reached me.

I grit my teeth and started stabbing with my scalpel and bludgeoning with the butt of my pistol. 

It was a whirlwind of gore and death that I couldn’t keep track of until I was straddling a local on the ground, beating its face in with my handgun.

I stood up and realized I was hoarsely mumbling “not loosing another friend”

A gentle hand was set on my shoulder and I flinched away, wiping blood off my face and looking at a very concerned cassias.


“You’re bleeding” he stated softly. Gesturing to my arm.

I looked over and yes there was a small cut in my arm.

I pulled a bandaid from my pocket and some neosporin, putting the goop on the cut before slapping the bandage over it. 

I went back to my backpack and satchel wordlessly, discarding the ruined scalpel. I reloaded my handgun, put it in its holster and grabbed my satchel and backpack. Jogging over to Clara who looked dazed.

I quickly diagnosed the problem as a concussion as one pupil was dilated while the other was shrunk down. Possible brain damage.

I jumped to work rubbing the inside of her arm with an alcohol patch and filling a syringe with an anti inflammatory to keep swelling down as I doctored her cuts and spread salve on bruises.

When I was done she thanked me and I sat back before a distant gunshot rang out, and I watched Clara fall back, a hole in the middle of her forehead.

I stood just as cassias dropped to a similar fate.

I looked up just as the glint of a scope focused on me from hundreds of yards down the road.

I was on my feet and behind cover when a round pinged off a steel girder by my head.

I was frozen, in fear and in grief. All my effort to save them, and they get gunned down right in front of me.

A round zinged off the metal above me, forcing me lower into cover. Suddenly that numbness was replaced by that same, caustic emotion and I knew if I didn’t fight back I was dead.

I closed my eyes for a moment as everything seemed to freeze. I looked at my already bloody hands and clenched them into fists. 

It’s, MY Turn.

I sprinted from cover, a red hot piece of lead scorching my ass as I dove for the side by side and Clara’s rifle.

I scooped it up, switched it to semi and ran to the other side of a bombed out skyscraper, out of angle for the sniper.

I took a deep breath and reached into my satchel, retrieving an auto injector of epinephrine.

I bit the safety cap off and slammed it into my leg, holding it there for ten seconds as the artificial adrenaline entered my body.

Everything seemed to zoom out as I took of running, slinging my satchel to the ground. 

I rounded a building and ran straight at the glint, dipping side to side randomly as rounds whizzed centimeters past my face.

The marksmans blind was a tangle of broken metal and as I closed the distance I saw the rifle get drawn back. 

I aimed and fired three rounds into the pile, the suppressor sputtering as I heard the wet thwack of lead on meat and bone.

I sprinted straight forward as I heard maniacal laughs of pain. 

I slowed as I got close, poking my rifle through the opening, and looking at the doctor, still in his dingy scrubs, holding his shoulder where I’d hit him.

He looked at me with crazed eyes as I slipped in, able to stand in the sniper blind.

“You can’t kill me, you took the oath HAHAHA” he screamed as I put the sights on his face.

I paused, he was still very much a person, but he was no longer a threat to my life, I couldn’t kill him.

I couldn’t, but the locals can.

I grabbed him hard by the sides of the neck, the adrenaline in my body giving me the raw strength to pull him from the blind and drag him down the road.

“Your friends were such easy targets haha.  That one in the warehouse looked so shocked hehe.”

I paused, looked back down at him with a blank face and he shut up, fear entering those crazed eyes.

“No...” he whispered as I hauled him up and smacked him against a metal beam. 

I grabbed a cable by my feet and began wrapping it around his torso, between his legs and around his wrists.

I stepped back as he struggled against it. Then very closely leaned in to say “hope you enjoy yourself” then I pulled a wrapped scalpel from my pocket and slashed his chest, drawing blood.

I heard the screams of the locals as I walked away, to my backpack and pulled out the sat phone.

I called hq as the mad doctor began to scream, I looked back as a little local girl sank her teeth into his leg.

The commander picked up and I spoke “Clara and cassias have passed, Tommy has passed, Jason is going awol, I have a city to clean.”

I hung up and as the adrenaline wore off I noticed the bleeding hole in the center of my chest.

I walked over to cassias and Clara, closing their eyes and folding their hands over their chests.

Then, I layed down, folded my hands over the hole in my chest as a green army helmet with a Red Cross leaned over me, shouting something, something I couldn’t make out.

A gentle hand took mine and I looked up into Tommy’s face. I went to pull myself to him but he stopped me saying 

“Your place is here, you did your best to save us, now it’s our turn”

Do you remember how much effort it cost you?Our today’s hero - is a successful guy from the Gold Coast, Australia, that easily gets what he wants now. But that wasn’t always like this.  


Anthony Bayer's story began in high school, when he was addicted to fast food that led him to weight problems. So, he weighed almost 347 lbs. And here comes the graduation day. Dancing, elegant suits and dresses, graduation from school. What can be better you will  say.  
Anthony thought the same. He dared to invite the most beautiful girl in class, though he knew that she would never agree.  
So can you imagine his excitement, when the girl did agree to his invitation?   
The boy was on cloud nine. He was so delighted that went to the nearest mall and bought the best suit for the graduation ceremony. He even rented a limo for this special day.  
And all of  this was done to impress his beautiful companion.

And here comes the graduation day! Anthony all dressed up came up to the girl’s house. He knocked at the door and was waiting for her beautiful smile, that he liked so much. The girl opened the door, but her smile wasn’t the one that he expected.  
She laughed at his face and said: \`*Sorry, you are just so fat that you cannot even fit through the door\`.* And slammed the door in front of his face.  
We cannot even imagine what our main character was feeling at that moment. Nobody would ever understand him and guess what was in his head on that day.  
The graduation day was completely ruined and the memories will be following him for a long period of time.

A couple of years after, the guy put himself together and started exploring everything about a healthy lifestyle.  
The guy learned literally EVERYTHING about proper nutrition, endlessly worked out at the gym and the result did not take long.   
Anthony lost 60 pounds thanks to his patience, perseverance and hard work.   
Noone teases the guy anymore, and moreover, he gets date offers every single day!  
Guess who he’s got the message from recently?   
Yes, from the same girl who rejected him at the school ball. It was a complete triumph.  
The girl who mocked Anthony at school invited him on a date!  
What did our hero respond to her  message? -You’ll ask.   
He acted like a real man. He decided to ignore the message.  
Although he forgave the girl, he still couldn't forget the situation, the guy admits.

Anthony has since opened his own personal training business called 'Transform Your Future' in order to help those who are in the same position that he was five years ago.

*'I've gone through a lot, but my experiences have made me the man I am today. My message is just never give up, even when everything seems hopeless.\`*  
*'My goal now is to help others who have been through the same things I have. If I can do it, anyone can do it.\`*  
*'I feel so much happier about life and I'm looking forward to the future.'*\-says Anthony Bayer. 

As we can see, life prepares various obstacles for us. But if we have the strength to endure them, we will definitely bask in glory after all. ",stories,"The Guy that was rejected by a girl for being overweight, refused HER date proposal after 5 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lpzwkz/the_guy_that_was_rejected_by_a_girl_for_being/,1613999162.0

We live on 12 acres, somewhere in the middle of nowhere, in the New Mexico frontier.  We fenced a 1/3 or 1/2 ?? acre area around the house, front and back.  During the day, our goats and chickens freely roam the property, outside the fenced area.

1:30 - 1:40 this afternoon.  The (fenced) dogs are barking frantically.   The dogs bark when the goats get into mischief.  They bark when they hear coyotes.  They bark at other dogs barking.  This bark is a different bark.  I've heard it before.  Once it was a rattlesnake.  Once it was elk at the fence.  Many times it has been coyotes.  This bark says something different is afoot!  

Again, despite my previous experiences, I exit our 240 sq. ft. house without a means of defense.  When am I going to learn?  When?

I exit the front door (our only door) into the fenced area to see what all this mayhem is all about.  To my right I see 2 of our dogs targeted on something, their heads through the horse panel fencing, giving it all they've got.  The goats are in front of the dogs, beyond the fenced area, frozen in a huddle with their asses together and looking in the same direction as the dogs.  Next to the goats, outside of the fence, I see little Booda Dog has taken a bulldog stance and is staring fixedly in the same direction.  She is silent.  I notice that some of our hens are gathered under the trailer we use to haul wood.  

There is a greenhouse (I use that term loosely) blocking my attempt to follow their gaze.  Beyond the greenhouse is the chicken coop and beyond the chicken coop is the goat's pen.  A long row of 'buildings' (I use that term loosely).  I walk the length of our tiny house and around the end, the dogs still giving it all they've got.  Goats still frozen.  Booda striking a pose.  I follow their gaze.

There it was.  Right up next to the goat pen.  Less than 75 feet from where I stood.  So close that I was taken aback.  TOO close!

When it saw me, it didn't move.  We stared at each other, while I wondered what it was thinking.  I assess my best recourse, given I had nothing to defend any animal or myself.  My only thought, of all things, was ""Bigfoot""!  I took a deep breath, stretched my hands above my head, like some monster in a Scooby Doo cartoon, and gave my best impression of a bigfoot roar!  Such an epic fail, I think I squeaked instead of roared.   I had to try again!  It didn't move a muscle and stood there looking at me for a very long second before it sauntered off.  I swear to you, it was weighing it's odds on securing a chicken dinner.   It didn't run.  It didn't trot.  It sauntered.  Like it owned the joint.

It looks like a coyote, but it's much bigger.  For a moment I considered letting the dogs on it, but it's bigger than Sadie the red tick hound!  Not quite as big, but almost as big as Yago the lab/husky? mix.  In the midst of chaos, I was sizing up the dogs vs. predator, taking note of size and closeness.  I had a few moments of hard time processing what I was seeing.  I don't believe for a single second that this is a coyote.  I wonder if I have time to grab a camera!  

I'll say it again: It ain't NO STINKIN' NORMAL COYOTE! 

I watched him trot across clear land and into the tree line, toward the road.  He stopped and turned to stared back at me, shadowed in the canopy of the trees.  Does he think that I can't see him?  He changes direction and walks the tree line back INTO the property.   I lost sight of it behind the hill, where I put grain out for the goats (a little version of Hide and Seek)!  It'll be a cold day in July before I do that again!

I count the hens.  All there.  One hen = 4 eggs per week.   Last year I lost all my hens AND a rooster in the span of 3 hours, while I was IN the house, no doubt yelling 'hush up' and 'shhhh' at the dogs!   

What if I had been IN the goat's pen, sweeping or cleaning?  What if I had been IN the coop, collecting eggs?  This animal was too close!  It is comfortable enough to come across a clearing!  It stared me down!  I didn't 'scare' it.  Good gravy, the small dogs and the chickens can run through the horse panel to safety, but I can't!  

It will come back.  There is no doubt in my mind.

56,jaysces,1614017367,"Tl:dr boyfriend made me a romantic bath, chaos ensued. Watch what you put in someone’s bath. 

My boyfriend is the most amazing person in the world. 

He is beautiful and kind and I have to say this now or he’ll end up seeing this and get upset. He’s amazing, really. 

It was my birthday this weekend and as a romantic gesture he picked me up and took me to his house. His mom went out to let us have space (cutie) 

So I arrive and he says he’s made me a bath, I go up and get in and smells nice and there’s candles a little drink in the side and he goes out. 

Suddenly, I feel something isn’t right, the water feels weird. 

I thought “has he spiked my drink the water wasn’t thick before” 

I text him for assistance with my one dry hand, no answer

I then text his mom to get him to help me because something is wrong. 

I try to stand up and fall over straight away. The water is oozing off my body in clumps. 

What the hell? 

I can’t get out the bath. There’s a few candles but it’s really dark because he turned the light off. 

I’m panicking a little. What the hell? 

I try to grab my phone to text for assistance but it flies out my hand due to the slimey water. The consistency was getting thicker and thicker as I kept struggling to get out. 

I try to grab a candle in sheer panic to find where the towel was and it slips out my hand. 

He finally arrives while I’ve been in a prison of goo, and says dinner is nearly ready. 

He has come to be romantic and (you know we’re adults)

I look at him and say “get me the fuck out of here”  

I couldn’t find the towel, because it was so dark. I couldn’t text because slimey was everywhere 

Then he reveals what he put in the bath.  It wasn’t a bath bomb it was his little sisters slime powder. In big quantities. 
 
I was like a newborn baby out the womb but they get a towel in reach at least. 

As horrific as my experience felt at the time (like I was on acid) 

It was a thoughtful gesture and it’s gonna make me laugh for the rest of my life.

57,battlerazzle01,1614014342,"This story somehow comes up often in my life.  Mainly because it's gotta be the most ridiculous thing I've ever had happen to me when you look at the grand scheme of it all.  Let's set the stage.  


March 2019.  I'd been searching around for new jobs ever since I found out I was going to be a father.  And while I made sure my resume was up to snuff, I was being a bit overzealous and applying to positions that aren't exactly in my wheelhouse, or entirely above my pay grade because hey!  It might work.  I was given the directive by a friend to apply to machinist jobs because sometimes the employer would rather hire somebody who knows nothing, and that it might still net me a decent paying job.  So I did exactly that.  


I get an email one day from a machinist job I applied to.  I read the email, and then read it again.  It's from the CEO of the company.  He saw my application, sees that I'm not really qualified, but he really likes my resume and has another position in mind for me, and wants to know if i'd like to set up an interview.  Hell yeah I do!  The CEO is emailing me?  This has to be something I jump at.  So we set up a time for the coming Thursday at 10am and go from there.  


Thursday comes around, I show up trying not to lose my mind because this could be the beginning of something great.  I walk in and before I can reach the receptionist,  the CEO comes down the hallway asking if I am there for the 10am interview.  I said yes, I am here to meet Jeff (not real name).  He introduces himself and then leads me into the conference room.  We sit down and start talking about my work history.  He asks me all the usual questions you get in an interview.  What's your biggest weakness?  How do you work under pressure?  Where do you see yourself in 10 years?  All that jazz.  Then he starts explaining the job that HE wants me for.  In the middle of his explanation, he decides that he's going to show me the facility and where I would be working and what I would be doing.  Got to see the other guys in action and see how some of the machines work and what parts they create and what I would be dealing with.  After our mini tour, we returned to the conference room, talked for a bit more and then he said that he ""felt confident in my ability to exceed expectations for the job.""  He said the next step was to set up a secondary interview with all of management in the facility and go from there. So we set up for Wednesday of the following week at the same time.  Excellent.  


The day before the secondary interview, I get an email from the CEO.  My heart sinks as I am assuming they've decided to hire somebody else.  Instead, it is an apology.  There is a scheduling conflict on that Wednesday and he would like to know if moving it to Monday the next week would be an issue.  I said not at all, works great for me.  So we scheduled for Monday at 1pm.  


Monday comes, I show up and complete the same routine.  I walk in, tell the receptionist who I am there to meet and why.  Only this time, she looks at me kind of confused.  She tells me that Jeff isn't currently in today and there is no interviews on the schedule.  I explained that I was here previously and we had set up a secondary interview.  She asks which position I was applying for and then tells me to have a seat while she goes and gets that manager.  I see the manager and the receptionist come out and they're pointing at me, talking back and forth behind some glass doors before anybody comes to get me.  The manager greets me, introduces herself as Tammy (also not real name) and then asks me to sign in as I did previously.  I told her I never signed in last time.  She stared blankly at me for a moment before explaining to me how to sign in and that they would need to take my wallet and my phone before I could proceed past the receptionist desk.  I obliged without question, although I did feel a bit uneasy because this wasn't anything I had to do previously.  We went to the same conference room and quickly rehashed the interview I had previously with Jeff.  She apologizes for the confusion, and says that there is nothing in the schedule for interviews, as there are no current open positions.  But she is willing to give me the assessment test that all machinist applicants are required to take beforehand.  I explained to her that I had no prior machining experience and that I knew nothing about a test.  She tells me it's fine, just do the best I can on the test.  She leaves me with a 5 page test packet and leaves.  


The ten minutes she was gone was the longest ten minutes ever.  I stared at this first question with zero understanding of what it was asking me.  She came back in to see how I was doing, and I apologized as I handed her back the empty test, telling her that I have no idea what is on those pages, that the position Jeff offered me had nothing to do with anything on those pages.  She seemed very concerned at that point.  She asked me to walk her through my previous interview with Jeff and tell me what exactly was discussed and how it went.  She showed initial concern when I told her that I had never signed in or given my belongings to the receptionist.  But the real reaction was when I mentioned that Jeff had walked me through the facility and showed me what I would be doing.  She cut me off and asked me to follow her out of the conference room.  We went back to the receptionists desk where the receptionist as well as the head of security was standing there.  She had me recount my interview, which pretty much shocked everybody.  I learned that Jeff had been out of the country for almost two weeks and there's no record of him being in the building during my previous interview.  They followed this up with an explanation that the parts they machine are in the aerospace sector and specifically for government contracts.  They explained to me simply that me being in the building, never having signed in, no way for them to track my actions during my interview, was a direction violation of their security standards and furthermore was in violation with their confidentiality with the government contract and now both them and myself could possibly be seen as a threat to national security.  They gave me back my belongings, apologized for the confusion, and let me know that they or somebody from the government might be in contact with me should this situation become a problem.  I was then promptly escorted from the building and told not to return.  I emailed the CEO personally, explaining what happened, with no response from him.  


A month later, I received an email from the CEO again, offering me a straight machinist position, for a considerably lower amount per hour.  I responded with an explanation of the events that transpired on that Monday, and the only response I got was ""I'm sorry.""  I never heard back from the company, and no government entity has contacted about it since then.  But I'm sure I am on a watch list now.

Jack sat in the back seat of the truck while the two beefcakes in the front sang along to some song that he’d never heard before. It was Metal, the fast-paced drum beat and the galloping guitar riffs made certain of that. He thought perhaps it was Black Metal, guessing from how the singer blurted out words like the cookie monster. Through the windshield, the high beams pierced the darkness—*like the bat signal*, from those batman comics he read religiously.

The mound of muscle known as Chaz sitting in the driver's seat reached for the radio knob and turned the rhythmic beats down to a low drone. “Come on Frosh,” he said, “Sing along man!”

Jack twiddled his thumbs, “I don’t know the lyrics,”

Jack saw Chaz’s eyes in the rearview mirror glaring at him with a squint that implied a thick smile. The big jock laughed and said, “Sorry, how rude of me. I didn’t even ask if you cared to listen to my playlist. You look frightened out of your mind Frosh. Turn that frown upside down Bud, you're well on your way to Bone-Town!”

The slab of muscle in the passenger seat with the missing front tooth and the douchey behavior—a running back Chaz referred to as Roady—chuckled and said: “Brah, if this is his first lay, it’s only natural for him to feel a bit jumpy.” 

It was just the day before when Chaz had approached Jack in the lunchroom when he caught him catching glances at a thicc piece of tail—a redhead who appeared to be Chaz's girlfriend. The mountain of muscle had walked in his direction, and at first, Jack thought the big dude was going to give him a wedgie or pour milk all over his face, but, to his surprise, Chaz came off as friendly. *You the new kid?* he had asked, *Been looking around for some new peps for a party. Having a get-together and was wondering if you’d like to come along.*

Chaz had also mentioned Jack's perverted glances toward the hot girl with red hair. *Saw you takin’ a peek. I can hook you two up if you’d like.* After hearing that, Jack was confused. Chaz was the star quarterback and the redhead was a cheerleader—arguably the hottest chick in Hughes Academy. It didn’t take a genius to figure the two of them were… *Nah, bro, we’re just good friends. I don't even have a girlfriend. You see, she’s a little shy. She was actually the one who asked me to invite you to the party.*

Jack looked out the window and chewed on his thumbnail, replaying over and over what he’d say to…

“Evangeline, bro,” Roady yelled, “She’s gonna love you man. Just get a little muscle on those bones of yours and maybe I will too.”

Chaz turned his nose up, “You’d like him if he gained some muscle… What are you a faggot?”

“Shut up, dick. You know what I’d mean. After the last guy, my friends’ list has been reserved for only the toughest of us.”

“The last guy?” Jack said, leaning forward in his seat. “What are you guys talking about?”

“Nothin’ Frosh. Forget about it.” Chaz careened the steering wheel right, onto a gravel road, simultaneously turning off the headlights. Small rocks and pebbles crunched under the weight of the tires and Jack could hear the car slowing to a stop.

“Where are we?” Jack said. From the front seat, he heard seat belts unclasping. 

“Farmer's road, off the 34. Gotta keep the lights off. The cops don’t like us coming in here.” Chaz said.

Jack had been a “Bad Boy” before. A few years ago he’d snuck out without his parent's permission, over to his friend's house to watch scary movies. He also took a puff of a vape once, but that’s neither here nor there. This: driving out on dark highways, keeping the headlights off in fear of getting caught by the POPO was exhilarating to him. His nerves cooled down and his adrenaline started pumping in waves. He felt as if he could take the world by storm; felt as if he could grab Evangeline by the…

“Frosh, keep your ears open for the fuzz and just follow behind.” 

The three of them shut the doors softly and went down a path that was just barely visible by moonlight. The gravel path gave way to a concrete sidewalk. Jack looked up and saw two wide steel gates with an arch curving over them. The arch had words on it but it was too dark to make out anything legible.

“What is this place?” Jack asked.

“Shhh keep it down,” Chaz said. “Just follow behind.”

They walked on the dark path for a while. The stars above and the yellow toenail of the moon didn't do a very good job of lighting the way, so Jack's imagination kicked in. He started to imagine what that red hair would smell like, or what she would look like in just panties. *Forget underwear*, he thought, *how about stark ass nak*—

The sound of a crack and an excruciating pain shot up Jack’s leg, “Owww, shit!” he croaked.

Chaz’s shadowy form turned to face Jack, “Goddammit, what now?”

“I hit some kind of stone. Sharp corner or something. Do you have a flashlight? I might be bleeding.”

“Don’t be a pussy Frosh. I brought you all the way out here to Bone-Town so you can get laid by Evangeline and all I’ve heard from you the entire night is bitch bitch bitch—“

The sound of footsteps that didn’t belong to any of the three college students came from out yonder in the trees that surrounded the immediate area. The footsteps got closer. Then, a thin beam of light shined their way. 

“That’s her,” Roady said, “About time your girl showed up, Chaz my boy.

*His girl?* Jack thought, *But he said he didn’t have…*

“Hey, boys,” The female voice holding the flashlight said, “What took you so long?”

Two more lights flashed on, originating from Chaz and Roady. The three of them focused their beams on Jack. He raised an arm to block the blinding lights.

“What the hell is going on here?” Jack said.

Chaz chuckled, “That ‘sharp stone’ you cut your leg on is a tombstone.” He then shined his beam onto the tombstone, revealing the words etched onto it. They read: 

EVANGELINE SHARON MONTGOMERY

LOVING WIFE AND MOTHER 

1958 - 2015

“And this…” Chaz said while moving the flashlight beam to a large rectangular hole. “Is Evangeline’s grave, and coffin. Damn thing took us a while to dig up so don’t be shy on camera.”

Jack backed away but was completely unaware that Roady had snuck up behind him. He felt two massive bear claws clasp onto his shoulders, holding them in place.

The girl with the red hair snickered and pulled out her phone. “Recording, baby.”

Chaz pointed his flashlight beam into the sky, illuminating his grinning face, looking as if he were about to tell a scary bedtime story. “Be gentle with her, she’s very old, Frosh.

But here is what happened during those few months, at least it will make up for the lack of entries. Please do enjoy them as I and Ludmilla have, Cheers!!

To clear it up, I had been watching the news in my dacha or second home in Minsk as the European Military Administration and the Eurasian Commonwealth made peace with one another while sipping my glass of rum, It was on May 9th, 1974, the anniversary of the Second Russian Civil War between the Soviet Union and the Eurasian Liberation Movement, great timing by the way. I should know because I was there to film the entire thing and to get interviews since my departure from Vienna in '71 while it was pre-recorded. 

So there I am talking to dignitaries and leaders from both sides of the conflict when out of the blue, a Ruthenian government aide approaches towards me as I was interviewing General Jürgen Bennecke, a high ranking member of the European Army and one of the EMA's representatives at the event. He asks me to come with him into this room inside the meeting place where this thing went down and I obviously said yes because I knew it had potential to be a big story for very good reasons and I was not wrong.

When I entered the room I see three people along with two ELM partisans on each side of the table, brandishing their British-made Sterling submachine guns and those three were the leaders of the new government in Russia: Fadeyka Holovaty, A Ukrainian and a leader of the Anti-Russian branch of the Eurasian Unity Party, Oliwia Jarosz, who's the founder of the Brown Brigade and war hero. Created the Polish-Eurasian Resistance Force and was a huge celebrity in the Commonwealth. And right in front of me at the end of the table was the Great Patron of the Eurasian Commonwealth himself! Nurzhan Diasev, Nurzhan Diasev, a Kazakh from the Eurasian Unity Party and perpetrator of the Alma-Ata uprising. A pragmatic and cool-headed strategist who advocates for a Federation of equals including the Russians. So there I am and they're asking me if I would be interested in joining them for a private dinner in Omsk with other high ranking members of the Eurasian Unity Party and I, being the esteemed journalist and reputable man that I was said yes!

However I come to realize the “something” was just absorbing it all. Only for it to show up now in my life as if it were a blatant and unsurpassable wall I must now deal with.

I had a dream when I was younger, one that has somehow became my reality in a sense. As short as it was, it was terrifying to me. 

I stood amongst many of my childhood friends, as perfectly clueless as we all were, we all knew that our names being called by our parents meant playtime was over and that we needed to go home. We all groaned in disagreement but we all knew better than to turn mom into “scary mom” if you with strict parents know what I mean. On the way home I reflected on the day with a smile on my face as optimistic as I could ever be. We get home and I immediately take a bath, change into PJ’s, and go towards my room for a much needed nap time.
However I get to the door and stand there. “I don’t want to go in there” I think to myself but it has to be done, I’m too tired. I knew what was in there. 
I had a mirror in my room that hung next to my currently empty closet. I take a look at it and notice I am frowning. As I stood in real life I wasn’t, my reflection was. The lights turned off but I could very clearly see it. My own voice spoke back to me saying “You know you won’t keep me in here for much longer”. 

Then I woke up. I didn’t know what the dream meant then, as I passed it off as my imagination being too wild. However as I am now I’m beginning to understand what my own reflection meant.",stories,Deep Within.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lpmtks/deep_within/,1613967945.0

“Are you sure you don’t require aid?” Quilx’tch asked uneasily.

The nutritional anthropologist was clinging to the underside of the damaged cargo transport easily enough. The steel bar that supported his six motile legs was more than strong enough to hold his slight weight. No, the unease came from flecks of iron rich blood that he could smell scattered on the underside of the frame.

“I have this Quick,” the human mechanic snapped.

Quilc’tch fell silent but didn’t leave. The human was writhing around in a most disconcerting way. Granted the odd movements of human joints were usually a little disturbing to any species with a proper exoskeleton but Quilx’tch was fairly certain that human arms were not supposed to bend like that. The pain filled grunts the human was letting out confirmed his suspicions.

“I know I could not be of use in a task that requires such raw strength,” Quilx’tch began uneasily. “It would really be no trouble for me to fetch another human to aid you.”

“I can do this myself!” The human growled. “I don’t need any help.”

Quilx’tch wondered at the hostility in the normally friendly human’s voice. What possible benefit could the human gain by insisting on performing a non-critical maintenance operation that clearly was meant to be done in pairs? Especially as there were many other humans close to aid him? A loud snap coincided with a triumphant crow from the human.

“See!” The human called out. “I told you I could do it myself.”

“You did,” Quilx’tch replied. “Though I do not know why you make a point of that, as I never expressed doubt that you could.”

The human stared at him blankly for a moment and then burst into laughter. He rolled out from under the transport and sprang to his feet. Quilx’tch followed him and climbed up on the proffered hand. The skin on the hand was torn in several places though the humans’ remarkable healing factor had already stopped the bleeding.

“Yeah I got a stubborn streak I guess,” the human said shrugging his shoulders as Quilx’tch climbed up his arm. “Sorry I snapped at you.”

“Apology accepted,” Quilx’tch replied. He wanted to pursue the matter but the human stretched and bent to pick up his tools.

“Come on, let’s get lunch,” the human said. “I get even more bull-headed when I’m hungry.”

So naturally I make my way to the pharmacy with my throat so swollen that I can’t move my head and a fever. When I get there, I show my prescription to the pharmacist who says he can’t give it to me. I proceed to explain that the law allows it while keeping in mind that he’s just following orders from higher up and none of it is his fault.

That’s when he starts telling me I should eat raw garlic instead of bothering getting a replacement prescription. RAW GARLIC. He goes on to explain that if I mix raw garlic with green tea I should be cured in a couple of days.

\[1\] Open House

&amp;#x200B;

 

""Yo, Link!"" My buddy Rocco called to me as I walked down the street of my hometown.

I turned to see him  jogging up to me. His hair looked freshly buzz-cut, and he was wearing a  pair of torn blue jeans and a grey t-shirt. He had his hands stuffed in  his pockets, and always carried himself slightly hunched over, like he  had something to hide. I waved as he caught up with me.

""How's it goin' Rocco?""

He shrugged, ""You're heading to open house, right?""

I nodded, ""Yeah. Family not coming?""

He didn't respond.

""Same here,"" I sighed, ""But whatever. Kind of feels like it's better that they don't, anyway.""

He shook his head as if  in disagreement, but didn't say anything else. His eyes looked shinier  than usual, but he turned his head away when he caught my gaze.

""Aaanyway, what class are you in this year? I'm in 1B.""

""2A,"" he answered, his voice cracking just *slightly*.

I pretended not to notice, ""Oh, damn. I was hoping they'd throw us in the same group.""

""Ehh, it's whatever, man. It's only freshman year, we'll probably have classes together at some point.""

""From what I hear, all the freshman boys have gym at the same time. Same goes for the girls. So there's that.""

We came up to a  stoplight, and I pressed the button to walk. I peered around us as we  waited for the signal. Traffic was unusually busy for our relatively  small town. But that was to be expected for open house night, I guess. A  group of upperclassman walked on the other side of the street toward  the school, laughing and making a ruckus. The signal went green, but  Rocco grabbed my shoulder as I started to walk.

""Not yet, amigo. We'll go on the next pass,"" His expression sent a chill down my spine.

""What's up, man?"" I asked.

He nodded at the upperclassman, ""We need to steer clear of those guys.""

""Why?""

""Bad news,"" was all he would say.

""Rocco, if this is another one of your vampire stories-""

He shot me a dirty look.

""Fine.""

I pressed the button again and we waited as the upperclassman headed further down the street.

""Hey guys! See you at school!"" A deep voice yelled from a passing car window.

Rocco and I both shot  our heads over to see our morbidly obese buddy Jason half-way out the  backseat window of his mom's car. His curly red hair whipped around  violently over his glasses as his mom sped through a red light. I caught  Rocco grinning in amusement as he watched them pass. 

""He's in a good mood  considering school starts tomorrow,"" I grumbled, reminding myself that I  was about to have responsibilities again.

""He's always in a good mood,"" Rocco said, still grinning as we passed the street.

Rocco was always really  fond of Jason and his family. I didn't really understand why, but  whenever Jason and Rocco were together, Rocco just seemed in higher  spirits. Maybe it's because he thinks Jason's general existence is  funny, or maybe Rocco is secretly gay and has a thing for morbidly obese  gingers with tons of freckles. *Shrug*.

Who knows.

""Did you hear what was on the news? Apparently another guy was killed in town a few days ago.""

Rocco shivered, ""Makes me nervous to walk the streets. Who knows when that psychopath is going to show up, you know?""

I nodded, ""It's definitely making the town feel creepy. You think it's the same guy like they're saying?""

""Has to be. They're the police. They know what to look for, right?""

""Fair point. It just seems unlikely that he could kill so many people without getting caught,"" I responded.

""What's he up to now?""

""Fourteen, I think.""

""Word on the street is, we're going to have an assembly about it tomorrow,"" A third voice joined the conversation.

""Hey Alec,"" Rocco said, increasing the distance between the two of us to let our abnormally tall friend in.

""Aloha amigo,"" Alec said in a fake Mexican accent, mocking Rocco's heritage.

Rocco softly punched his  shoulder, laughing in response. Alec donned his usual black hoodie,  regardless of the summer heat. His sandy-blonde hair shined brightly  under the beat of the sun, hanging just above his golden-brown eyes. He  was easily the most attractive of our friend group.

""Wonder what they'll say?"" I asked.

""Probably some dumb shit  about how we should stay off the streets and never do anything fun and  just go straight home and do our homework like good little drones,"" Alec  rolled his eyes.

""Yeah, probably,"" I agreed.

Ahead of us, the school  waited. A short stretch of grass separated the school from the road, and  decorative flowers and bushes lead up to the front entrance of the  school on either side of the side-walk. It towered four stories tall to  accommodate for nearby towns sending their students here. The school was  mostly made of small red bricks, but a massive green knight's helmet  was painted right in the middle, interrupting the lay of windows for  each classroom.

Our school mascot. I  never understood why our color was green when we were knights, but I  also never bothered to ask. On the top of the round arch in the middle  of the school, a large American flag flew from the roof of the building.  The warm reflection of the sun off the flagpole briefly blinded me as I  scanned it.

""Hello boys!"" A teacher with a neatly-trimmed brown beard greeted us.

He wore a green polo  shirt and traditional khaki pants, and his bald head reflected the sun  like a mirror. He was short, with a stocky build. I couldn't tell if he  was crazy ripped or just overweight, though. 

""Err, hi,"" I greeted the man.

""Alec Jones, right?"" He extended a hand to Alec.

His forearms were massive and riddled with thick brown hair. Alec shook his hand weakly.

""I'm Mr. Burns, your  homeroom teacher. I've had all of your older sisters in my classes, so I  know all about you. Welcome to high school! I look forward to a good  year with you!"" His enthusiasm was almost exhausting.

""Y-You too,"" He seemed super caught-off-guard.

Rocco choked back laughter.

""And you two are...?"" He asked, looking between Rocco and I.

""Rocco Mendoza, I'm in class 2A,"" Rocco straightened up, extending his hand to shake Mr. Burns'.

""Ah, one of Mrs.  Romano's students. She's a great teacher, but,"" he leaned in, covering  his mouth as if to be more secretive, ""be careful about having your  phone on. Make sure it's on silent, or Alec and I will be able to hear  her scream from down the hall,"" he whispered, giving Rocco a wink.

""Thanks for the heads up,"" Rocco said as they shook hands firmly.

""Anytime. And you?"" He looked my direction.

""Link,"" I said.

""Do you have a last name, Mr. Link?"" He teased.

""Rissoff,"" I looked into his eyes.

They were a deep brown, and I got the sense that he was a genuinely nice guy.

""Mr. Rissoff! You should have told me sooner, you're in my class as well! I'm not aware of any siblings, are you...?""

""An only child,"" I answered.

""Well, it's nice to meet  you. I hope my class keeps the both of you at least moderately  entertained this year. I aim to make at least one hour out of eight  reasonably bearable.""

I found myself grinning, ""Well, here's to hoping, then.""

""I don't mean to pry, gentlemen, but is there a reason your parents aren't here with you?"" 

I caught Rocco looking down at his feet in the corner of my eye.

""My parents are out of  town on business trips,"" Alec answered for himself, ""Link's parents have  more important things to do, and Rocco's have so much faith in him that  they sent him here to take care of himself so that they could stay home  with his sick younger brother,"" he lied, hanging his arms on our  shoulders and grinning confidently.

""Ah, well, I hope your brother starts feeling better very soon, Mr. Mendoza.""

Rocco nodded quietly, ""Me too...""

""Out of curiosity, why are you out in front of the school instead of inside?"" I asked Mr. Burns.

""I like to meet all of  the students coming to school, whether they're in my class or not. Helps  more than you would think, knowing everybody.""

I liked the way he spoke to us like we were already adults.

""Oh, Mr. Fallon!"" Mr. Burns' face lit up as he looked behind us.

I spun around to see a  guy my age walking up. He had long black hair, a long-sleeved shirt that  was black and white-striped, and black jeans on. He was practically  barren of all emotion as he approached, eyes focused on Mr. Burns.

""Mr. Jones, Mr. Risoff,  Mr. Mendoza, meet one of your peers, and a member of my homeroom class,  Mr. Niss Fallon. His older brother graduated here last year at the top  of his class. He was the brightest student I've ever had. He spoke very  highly of you,"" Mr. Burns beamed at the emo-wannabe.

Niss didn't really react to the statement, but shook Mr. Burns' hand when he outstretched it.

""How is he doing?"" Mr. Burns inquired.

""I'm not sure. Haven't spoken to him in a while. He's been busy with work.""

His voice was unexpectedly soft, and he both looked and sounded tired. Deep bags rested under his dark grey eyes.

""Oh? Where's he working?"" 

""The car mechanic shop  next to the gas station,"" Niss responded apathetically, looking at Mr.  Burns through the strands of his hair partially covering his face.

""I don't mean to  interrupt, but we're going to go on in and meet Rocco's teacher, Mr.  Burns. See you around!"" Alec said, wrapping his arms around the both of  us more tightly and pulling us away.

""Be safe out there, gentlemen!"" Mr. Burns called out to us as we walked into the school.

As we entered, the  office sat immediately to our left. Large windows gave a clear view in,  where various students were standing with their parents, who were  socializing with the office ladies. At the corner of the office, the  hallway opened up into a crossroads. Straight ahead was a long hallway  riddled with grey lockers along the right and left walls, with  occasionally breaks for classroom doors. The left hallway was  essentially a replica of the middle, with the exception of double-doors  at the far end that let in the golden-warm sunlight. The right hall was  short, and lead to a large cafeteria. The floor was full of white tiles,  with highway-style dashes of green tiles stretching down the middle of  each hallway.

""Man, I wish I had your homeroom teacher,"" Rocco complained as we headed down the middle hallway.

Alec smirked, ""You'll change your mind when you see Mrs. Romano.""

""Guys! Guys!"" Jason wheezed as he ran up to us, his glasses fogged from his body heat.

His equally obese mom  lagged well behind him, waddling through the double-door of the school  at her own pace. She had a large, afro-like bush of red girls tied back  in a ponytail. She wore a white dress shirt and green jacket that seemed  far too small for her size as she made her way toward us.

""Hey, Jason,"" I said, scooting over to make room for him to walk with us.

""So, what classes are you guys in?"" 

""Alec and I are in 1B, and Rocco's in 2A. What about you?"" I responded.

""Oh sweet, 1B here, too,"" he said in-between heavy breaths.

""Damn, I'm the only one not in the same class? Uuugh-"" Rocco froze in his tracks, staring at something ahead.

I cocked an eyebrow,  following his gaze. Up ahead, standing in front of a classroom door, a  tall, dark-haired woman stood, wearing a green polo shirt and khakis  like Mr. Burns. She had long, dark brown hair with a gentle wave as it  hung to her hips. Her skin was olive-tinted, and she wore dark-red  lipstick.

""Holy shit,"" I said, my jaw hanging slightly.

""Told you,"" Alec smirked again, rolling his eyes.

""Amigos, scratch what I just said. Class 1B is mi casa.""

""Jesus, where do I go to transfer classes?"" I asked, half-jokingly.

Rocco quickly walked  ahead of us and introduced himself to her, shaking her hand. His other  hand was tucked deep in his back pocket, as though he were comforting  himself through the endeavor.

""Rocco Mendoza, ma'am. I'm in your homeroom this semester.""

Mrs. Romano beamed at  his formal approach, ""Well it's a pleasure to meet you, Rocco! I'm  looking forward to having you in class!""

""Duuuude...Sign me up,"" I groaned.

""Hey, Link!"" I spun around to see a familiar face.

My childhood friend,  Mia. Her rich brown hair curled down to her shoulders, resting on the  white band T that she had thrown on for open house. She wore torn jeans  and red converse, something she pretty much always wore. Her light blue  eyes smiled as she walked up to us.

""Oh, hey Mia. What's up?"" I asked.

""What homeroom did you get?"" She asked, grinning at the three of us while Rocco continued talking to Mrs. Romano.

""1B, you?"" Alec interjected.

""Aw, dang. I got 2A with Mrs. Romano,"" She fussed.

""That blooows,"" I said, slightly disappointed she wouldn't be kicking it with us in Mr. Burns' class.

She nodded, leaning in and whispering to us, ""I hear she can be a real bitch, too.""

I peered behind us,  stealing a glance at her. She was deeply engaged in conversation with  Rocco, standing uncomfortably close to him.

""Mr. Burns warned Rocco about having his phone on, but other than that she seems friendly, I think.""

""I dunno, I've heard bad things too,"" Jason finally joined in, having caught his breath.

""Well, let's see,"" Mia said, walking past us to greet her.

""Hi, I'm Mia. I think you're my homeroom teacher?""

Rocco shrank back to our  group as we observed the interaction, both of his hands stuffed into  his back pockets. Mrs. Romano's face immediately turned sour as she  looked Mia up and down.

""Class 2A?"" She asked dully.

""Mhm!"" Mia responded enthusiastically.

Mrs. Romano took a deep  breath, ""Well, I want to inform you that cell phones are strictly not  allowed in my class. I expect you to be on time. I close my door at  exactly 8AM, so don't expect to get in if you're running late.""

""Dude she suddenly got way less hot,"" I whispered to Rocco.

""Well I don't usually run late, so we should be all good!"" Mia tried to maintain a positive atmosphere.

Mrs. Romano looked down the bridge of her nose at her and nodded, ""I'll see you on the first day of class, then.""

""A-Alright,"" Mia was clearly uncomfortable at this point.

""Well, is there anyone  else we want to go see before we call it good?"" I asked, gently pulling  Mia by the arm back toward our group.

Her skin was warm and soft to the touch. Her eyebrows were twisted upward in defeat.

""Wait, we're not going to go see the rest of our teachers?"" Jason asked in confusion.

""We most certainly are.  Come on, Jason, let's get moving so we can go get dinner. Your father  wants KFC tonight,"" his mom suddenly materialized in front of us.

""Aw, sweet! Alright, I'll catch you guys later!"" He said, beaming at the thought of his dinner.

""Wwwweeell, I wasn't really planning on it, how about you guys?"" I answered his question, despite him already being gone.

""I am actually gonna go  meet my other teachers, but you guys can feel free to do whatever. I  guess I'll see you later, unless you want to join me?"" Mia asked, her  eyes hopeful.

""Euuuuhhhh..."" I trailed off, unsure of how to respond.

She rolled her eyes and half-smiled, ""I get it. I'll catch you guys later.""

""Later Mia, stay safe,"" Alec said nonchalantly as he looked at the front entrance of the school, down the hall.

""Do you guys wanna do anything, then?"" I asked.

""Meh, I think I'm gonna go see a movie. You guys wanna go? I can't pay for the both of you, though,"" Alec said.

I shook my head, ""I don't have any dough. Rocco?""

""No dice, amigo.""

""Whelp. I'll see you two tomorrow morning. Stay safe, alright?"" 

""You too, man,"" I gave him a fist bump as he headed out of the school.

I looked to Rocco. He  seemed mildly entertained by everything going on. He usually wore that  expression, like life was just a chill stroll 95% of the time.

""Do we just...head home, then...?"" I asked, kind of disappointed.

He shrugged, pulling his  hands out of his back pockets and  stuffing them into his front  pockets, and started heading for the exit. I quickly caught up,  following along.

*Lame.*

""You ready for freshman year?"" I asked him as we passed Mr. Burns.

""Yeah, I guess. Just another year, you know?""

""I mean, yeah, but it's all different now. We're high-schoolers, man!"" I gave him a friendly shove.

He laughed, shoving me back, ""That's true, but is it really gonna be that much different?""

""I sure as hell hope so!"" I said as we hopped onto the sidewalk and started passing stores and restaurants.

The stores and  restaurants in our small town were unusually close together. I guess  when they first built the town, they expected it to grow into a bustling  city or something, but it never really happened. So chunks of it had  the aesthetic of being a huge city. The conversation between Rocco and I  kind of died in place, and we just walked for a while, taking in the  ever-busier scenes of the restaurants as families left open house.

""Whatcha gonna do, faggot?!"" I heard yelling from an alleyway ahead of us.

I looked to Rocco, whose  face had gone pale white, contrasting his darker skin tone. I picked up  my pace, quickly veering around the corner into the alley. The  emo-wannabe we met while talking to Mr. Burns was pinned up against a  brick wall by the group of upper class men that Rocco had intentionally  made us avoid earlier. The emo didn't fight back or anything, just  glared down at the guy holding him up. In the background, a large green  dumpster sat open, blocking an exit from the other side.

The guy was crazy  jacked. He was built like he was 25, and definitely a jock type. Spiky  blond hair, a white muscle shirt, the works. He had a shit-eating grin  on his face that really pissed me off.

I felt my body start shaking as I watched them.

*I-I gotta do something, right?*

Rocco grabbed my shoulder firmly and tugged hard.

""Let's get out of here, Link.""

""Rocco, we can't just-We can't-""

""Say something, pussy!"" 

I spun around to see him punch the emo kid in the gut. I heard the air leave him with impact.

""Amigo we need to get the fuck out of here before they target us next,"" Rocco warned, pulling my wrist hard.

I was shaking harder now. I pulled my wrist free of his grip, ignoring the pain.

""I can't just let it happen,"" I gritted my teeth.

*Goddamnit why am I like this?*

Before Rocco could convince me any further, before I could stop myself, my legs started carrying me toward them. 

""H-ey!"" I shouted, my voice catching in my throat.

The emo and the jock both looked over at me. His buddies all turned as well, and they grinned.

""Look who is coming to your rescue, just like your punk ass older brother!"" 

I started running  forward, balling my fist up. One of his friends tried to tackle me, but I  narrowly dodged him, impressing myself with my reaction time. I threw  my punch as hard as I could, and-

It bounced off of his back, not even fazing him.

""Wrong move, motherfucker.""

I felt arms roughly grab  me from behind, pinning my own behind my back. He dropped the emo kid  and turned to me, jabbing his fist hard into my ribs. The wind shot out  of my lungs, and I gasped hard, trying to bring air back into my lungs  and process what was happening at the same time.

*Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck*

The arms suddenly  released me and I spun around, preparing to run. Rocco was struggling  with the guy that was holding me, trying to restrict him with a  headlock.

""Get ou-"" The other jock jabbed him hard in the stomach with his elbow.

Rocco doubled over,  clutching his stomach. Two hands roughly shoved me forward, and I slid  on my knees, scraping them hard as my head snapped back from the sudden  impact.

""You faggots think you're tough?"" The jock shouted, giving me another hard shove.

My head snapped back  again as my upper body bolted forward, and I slammed my forehead on the  pavement. My ears rang as I tried to crawl to my feet to run, but he  roughly shoved me *again.* In front of me, Rocco was struggling to protect himself as the other guy started punching him over and over and over.

""C'mon man, let's just go. They're just a bunch of pussies,"" one of the other jocks said.

I felt hands grab me by  my arms and tug me to my feet. I was spun around to face the main jock,  who looked me in the eyes with a fierce glare.

""You had enough?""

I was shaking hard, and I nodded, trying not to cry.

""Next time you see shit happening, don't make it your fucking business then.""

He shoved me to my ass,  kicked the emo kid hard in the shin, and then walked out of the  alleyway. The other jock was still punching and slapping Rocco.

""Jace, let's go! I think he's had enough,"" One of the jocks called from around the corner.

Jace laughed before  roughly slapping Rocco again, then stood up and left. The three of us  lay on the ground for what felt like forever, holding our breaths and  hoping they didn't change their minds and come back.

Finally, I got the courage to stand up. Adrenaline had been pulsing through my veins and made all of my muscles ache. 

*W-We couldn't do anything. This wasn't like the movies. I can't fight...I can't fight at all. God...*

""R-Rocco, are you okay?"" I asked, shakily walking up to him. 

He was still curled up in a ball, shielding himself with his arms and legs. I grabbed his wrist and he flinched.

""Hey man, they're...They're gone. I-I'm sorry...""

He slowly pulled his  arms away, still fully tensed up. Tears were streaming from his eyes as  he climbed to his feet, ignoring my offered hand.

""A-Are you okay?"" I asked shakily.

He didn't respond. He  glared at the emo kid behind me. I turned around to see him standing,  hiding his eyes behind his pitch-black hair. He was clutching his ribs.

""U-Uh, hey. You're...Uh...Niss, or something?"" I asked.

He nodded, ""Yeah. Thanks.""

""N-No problem, even though we didn't really help...""

Without saying anything  else, he limped past us and left the alleyway. I didn't even know how to  respond. Rocco still had tears streaming down his cheeks, and his eyes  were bloodshot. But he wouldn't say a word. We both headed home, going  our separate ways as we did. 

""Rocco, I'm sorry..."" I said as he quietly limped down his street, away from my own.

No response.

I walked home, feeling  completely void of emotion, as though it had all just...Left me. As I  approached the shitty single-wide trailer we lived in, I didn't even  really feel anything when the steps up to the door cracked slightly  under my feet, or when I saw that the door was open and the A/C was off  despite how hot it was outside.

I walked through the  house as the TV blared and my parents yelled at each other, and just  went into my room, shutting the door. I pulled up my window, letting a  warm breeze rush in, cooling my sweaty face. I sat on my bed, kicking my  shoes and socks off and tossing them onto the floor, and pulled my  knees into my chest, staring blankly at the door.

I started hyperventilating, and then bawled my eyes out.

...

...

...

Suddenly I was awake. It  was dark, save for the moonlight illuminating my room. The warm breeze  had gone cold, and I shivered, realizing that at some point I had fallen  asleep. My feet were freezing, and the house was eerily quiet.

*J-Jeez it's cold...I need to shut my window...*

*Thump*

Something lightly tapped the top of my window. It sounded like a small pebble hitting it. I froze.

*Thump*

I sat up, looking over  at the window. There was nothing there, although I stared intently at  it. Fear paralyzed me as I waited for the thump once more. My window was  at ground level.

Silence.

Suddenly I caught it out of the corner of my eye. There was something in my room.

I slowly turned my head,  focusing my eyes on the tall, broad figure, a silhouette standing idly  against my wall. I stared in terror, silently praying to myself that I  was just making up shapes.

The corners of its mouth twisted upward in an evil grin, revealing rows of jagged, sharp teeth.

""LINK!""

I bolted upright,  breathing hard. Sunlight shined through my window. I was drenched in  sweat. I looked around in a panic, but there was nothing in my room. It  was warm, and my feet weren't cold anymore. I heard shuffling outside my  room, but no TV or yelling anymore.

*Thump*

I yelped, jumping  practically out of my skin as I turned to the window. My shoes were  sitting at the foot of the window, just the slightest bit of movement  from them caught my eye. The window was still open, but the breeze had  turned warm once more.

*What the hell...? I thought I kicked them off at the foot of my bed?*

*Knock knock*

""Hey, get up. If you  miss school and we have to go to court again for that truancy bullshit,  I'm kicking you out,"" My dad threatened.

*School...?*

I looked at the black digital clock that I had set on a cardboard box next to my bed.

7:34 AM glowed in red.

*Shit it's already morning? Class starts soon, fuck!*

I bolted out of bed and  scrambled to throw on some somewhat presentable clothes, and dowsed  myself in cologne to cover up the fact that I hadn't showered, grabbed  my bag and bolted out the door.

I dont remember anything exept getting in the van, checking my stuff, and then getting home. I felt the warm air and heard the waves crash close by. I was talking my father and he asked where my coat was. As I tried to wave them down to come back I had seen that they were already coming my way. 

I got my coat and off they went. Once I had my items I went inside of a place that I had never been in before. Exept I had this weird familiarity with it. It was different from every other house I've ever dreamed of, infact most of the time Im in a house its either a none existant part of my current home or somewhere ive never been. Instead it felt like home, like I had been away for a while and was finally back. Its was a small naturally lit modern home by the beachside with no lighrs on. With a dirt road out front leading to an industrial district. It gets fuzzy from there but this vivid memory of me walking on the shore of the body of water by my ""home"". I didn't feel the sand on my feet, nor did I hear any other sound. All I remember was the warm air and the sound of the waves crashing on the shore looking towards the horizon of a cloudless day.

The next thing I remember I was talking with someone. I dont remember there face but as I got up I gained control of my movement. Its was like taking control of a character in a video game. I dont know if I went lucid as I didnt think I was in a dream, but as soon as I did my eyes felt dry. So I blinked, I saw darkness for a couple seconds then I woke up. 

This has brought some dream and nightmare fragments that I had forgotten. A room comes to mind. Biege walls and carpet. There were four rooms but I had always chose one.

My mind is warping the dream as I remember it. Its been reduced to images and sound now. For some reason I long to go back there. Back to the place that felt like home, even for a moment. If any one would like to recreate it just think of the modern homes with the big windows.

75,pizzansteve,1613965878,"So I suddenly remembered this while I was drawing something.

So it all happened a few years ago in an art contest in my school(before COVID). And one of my classmates/friends also joined the competition and he drew this very simple but very cool monster with grass a man and everything.

But a few years before that he actually did the same thing but its just a man walking into a forest. So I didn\`t win so neither did him but atleast we tried.

76,WerewolfOverlord,1613958673,"Many religions have variations of the same characters. For example, Greek mythology uses a creature called Cerberus. In Demonology, it or rather, she is the guardian of Hell, a 3-headed giant dog. In Brooklyn, Crowley awaits his messengers who haven't reported in. The hellishly designed doors blast open, both informants flying in, grasping their throats. A woman in a black dress with red hair walks in. Crowley said,"" Oh for Christ's sake...."" The demons cough up their own insides, dying in the process. The woman says,"" Did you miss me?"" Valentino and Vox clear their throats before leaving. Velvet follows as Ravelious asks,"" Who in the fuck are you?"" Crowley replies,"" My dear friends, this is Rowena, my mother... What are you doing here, you bitch?"" Rowena scoffs and says,"" Fergus, you always were a grumpy lad."" Valentino says,"" Your name is Fergus?"" Crowley replies,"" Shove it, you pimp. Mother, unless you need something, show yourself out."" Rowena snaps her fingers, sending a cage floating inside. Crowley notices the occupants are three girls, hands bound. He says,"" Who the hell are they?"" Rowena says,"" I'd like to introduce Cerberus, the former guardian of the Hellish gates. Excuse their lack of conversation. I had to mute them. They wouldn't stop yapping."" Crowley says,"" Well, unmute them. I haven't talked to them in years."" In the corner of the room, a small demonic bird watches, reporting back to Caimio.


Act 1: The Prisoner:

At a safe house, Castiel and the demons sit around, waiting for their mortal friends to show up. Gremory gets a call from Ashlyn. She says,"" What's Crowley up to? We got Undyne in Florida, Mangle in Utah, Camila in Kansas with the Winchester's, and whoever's left in Texas on some vampire thing."" Gremory replies,"" Caimio's spy worked well. Sadly, Crowley got a visitor."" Ashlyn replies,"" Who? Another demon?"" Gremory replies,"" No, his mother. She brought three girls in a cage."" Ashlyn replies,"" Were they blondes?"" Gremory replies,"" Yeah, why?"" Ashlyn replies,"" It's Cerberus. We gotta bust her out."" Gremory asks,"" Is someone just simping for the demon dog girl?"" Zoe laughs in the background while Ashlyn replies,"" Just meet us in New York.""


Act 2: Grave Danger:

In New York, Gremory, Cass, Zoe, Ashlyn, and Valefar plan their move against the demons. At the docks, Furfur leads an operation to purchase arms for Crowley's army. Valefar uses four pistols to take out the demon guards. Furfur hears the shots and groans and alerts his angel escort. Gremory uses a Limbo-made shotgun to kill 2 angels, blasting their knees out. Ashlyn shoots the loading team along with 2 demons and 3 angels. She says,"" These bullets do make smiting these Biblical freaks easy."" Cass smites another demon before Furfur beats him with a crowbar. Furfur says,"" I always did hate you, Castiel!!! Time to smite God's star player!!!!"" Castiel pins Furfur into a shipping crate with a rod. Zoe goes to shoot him, aiming at the deer demon's head. Castiel lowers her gun and says,"" Crowley would just replace him and we need answers."" Furfur chuckles and says,"" Screw you... I know what you want. You'll never get it. I don't know where Cerberus is. Only the king, his mother, and the three V's"" Zoe shoots Furfur in the leg causing him to wince in pain. Furfur says,"" I truly don't know where the Overlords are hiding her. All I was told is to complete this deal and that Cerberus is in safe hands."" Castiel knocks him out before saying,"" We need to move. Cerberus is in danger and I fear Crowley's mother has brought something truly evil."" The group mops up the last of the demons and angels, killing or smiting them.







Act 3: The Rescue:


Crowley sits in the limo of his convoy along with the three V's. Crowley sips his wine as Valentino sleeps. Vox asks,"" You really think that every demon that doesn't obey really needs to be caged? It's just excessive, my king."" Cerberus whimpers in pain while chained. The first one wipes her ear, the second licks the first's arm. Velvet gags at the sounds of the dog demons. Crowley says,"" Saleos, turn the damn sound off."" A voice replies,"" Yes, my king. Muting now."" Crowley says,"" For Christ's sake, that thing is disgusting. I see why you want it dead."" Vox replies,"" Please burn it..."" Castiel teleports inside the truck and frees Cerberus. The demons rub their heads against his legs. Castiel teleports them out. When the convoy reaches its destination, Crowley kills half the guards for failing him. At the safe house, Zoe and Ashlyn stare at the triplets, who now wear black suits, red ties, black skirts, red leggings, and black boots. The first one says,"" Hi, Dog lady. I want head pats."" Zoe chuckles as another one crawls on her lap, acting exactly like a dog. Castiel says,"" I'd never imagined the Gate Guardian would be this....."" Gremory replies,"" Playful? Yeah, she's always been like this. People back then didn't understand playfulness and took it as aggression."" The triplets all pile up and fall asleep. Castiel says,"" I've never seen demons like this. It's quite nice.""

77,_KILLBLADE_,1613955471,"Jack sat in the back seat of the truck while the two beefcakes in the front sang along to some song that he’d never heard before. It was metal—the fast-paced drum beat and the galloping guitar riffs made certain of that. He thought perhaps it was Black Metal, guessing from how the singer blurted out words like the cookie monster. Through the windshield, the high beams pierced the darkness like the bat signal from those batman comics he read religiously.

The mound of muscle known as Chaz sitting in the driver's seat reached for the radio knob and turned the rhythmic beats down to a low drone. “Come on Frosh,” he said, “Sing along man!”

Jack twiddled his thumbs, “I don’t know the lyrics,”

Jack saw Chaz’s eyes in the rearview mirror glaring at him with a squint that implied a thick smile. The big jock laughed and said, “Sorry, how rude of me. I didn’t even ask if you cared to listen to my playlist. You look frightened out of your mind Frosh. Turn that frown upside down Bud, you're well on your way to Bone-Town!”

The slab of muscle in the passenger seat with the missing front tooth and the douchey behavior—a running back Chaz referred to as Roady—chuckled and said: “Brah, if this is his first lay, it’s only natural for him to feel a bit jumpy.” 

It was just the day before when Chaz had approached Jack in the lunchroom when he caught him catching glances at a thicc piece of tail—a redhead who appeared to be Chaz's girlfriend. The mountain of muscle had walked in his direction, and at first, Jack thought the big dude was going to give him a wedgie or pour milk all over his face, but, to his surprise, Chaz came off as friendly. *You the new kid?* he had asked, *Been looking around for some new peps for a party. Having a get-together and was wondering if you’d like to come along?*

Chaz had also mentioned Jack's perverted glances toward the hot girl with red hair. *Saw you takin’ a peek. Brah, I can hook you two up if you’d like.* After hearing that, Jack was confused. Chaz was the star quarterback and the redhead was a cheerleader—arguably the hottest chick in Hughes Academy. It didn’t take a genius to figure the two of them were… *Nah, bro, we’re just good friends. I don't even have a girlfriend. You see, she’s a little shy. She was actually the one who asked me to invite you to the party.*

Jack looked out the window and chewed on his thumbnail, replaying over and over what he’d say to…

“Evangeline, bro,” Roady yelled, “She’s gonna love you man. Just get a little muscle on those bones of yours and maybe I will too.”

Chaz turned his nose up, “You’d like him if he gained some muscle… What are you a faggot?”

“Shut up, dick. You know what I’d mean. After the last guy, my friends’ list has been reserved for only the toughest of us.”

“The last guy?” Jack said, leaning forward in his seat. “What are you guys talking about?”

“Nothin’ Frosh. Forget about it.” Chaz careened the steering wheel right, onto a gravel road, simultaneously turning off the headlights. Small rocks and pebbles crunched under the weight of the tires and Jack could hear the car slowing to a stop.

“Where are we?” Jack said. From the front seat, he heard seat belts unclasping. 

“Farmer's road, off the 34. Gotta keep the lights off. The cops don’t like us coming in here.” Chaz said.

Jack had been a “Bad Boy” before. A few years ago he’d snuck out without his parent's permission, over to his friend's house to watch scary movies. He also took a puff of a vape once, but that’s neither here nor there. This: driving out on dark highways, keeping the headlights off in fear of getting caught by the POPO was exhilarating to him. His nerves cooled down and his adrenaline started pumping in waves. He felt as if he could take the world by storm; felt as if he could grab Evangeline by the…

“Frosh, keep your ears open for the fuzz and just follow behind.” 

The three of them shut the doors softly and went down a path that was just barely visible by moonlight. The gravel path gave way to a concrete sidewalk. Jack looked up and saw two wide steel gates with an arch curving over them. The arch had words on it but it was too dark to make out anything legible.

“What is this place?” Jack asked.

“Shhh keep it down,” Chaz said. “Just follow behind.”

They walked on the dark path for a while. The stars above and the yellow toenail of the moon didn't do a very good job of lighting the way, so Jack's imagination kicked in. He started to imagine what that red hair would smell like, or what she would look like in just panties. *Forget underwear*, he thought, *how about stark ass nak*—

The sound of a crack and an excruciating pain shot up Jack’s leg, “Owww, shit!” he croaked.

Chaz’s shadowy form turned to face Jack, “Goddammit, what now?”

“I hit some kind of stone. Sharp corner or something. Do you have a flashlight? I might be bleeding.”

“Don’t be a pussy Frosh. I brought you all the way out here to Bone-Town so you can get laid by Evangeline and all I’ve heard from you the entire night is bitch bitch bitch—“

The sound of footsteps that didn’t belong to any of the three college students came from out yonder in the trees which surrounded the immediate area. The footsteps got closer. Then, a thin beam of light shined their way. 

“That’s her,” Roady said, “About time your girl showed up, Chaz my boy.

*His girl?* Jack thought, *But he said he didn’t have…*

“Hey, boys,” The female voice holding the flashlight said, “What took you so long?”

Two more lights flashed on, originating from Chaz and Roady. The three of them focused their beams on Jack. He raised an arm to block the blinding lights.

“What the hell is going on here?” Jack said.

Chaz chuckled, “That ‘sharp stone’ you cut your leg on is a tombstone.” He then shined his beam onto the tombstone illuminating the words. They read: 

EVANGELINE SHARON MONTGOMERY
LOVING WIFE AND MOTHER 
1958 - 2015

“And this…” Chaz said while moving the flashlight beam to a large rectangular hole. “Is Evangeline’s grave, and coffin. Damn thing took us a while to dig up so don’t be shy on camera.”

Jack backed away but was completely unaware that Roady had snuck up behind him. He felt two massive bear claws clasp onto his shoulders, holding them in place.

The girl with the red hair snickered and pulled out her phone. “Recording, baby.”

Chaz pointed his flashlight beam into the sky, illuminating his grinning face, looking as if he were about to tell a scary bedtime story. “Be gentle with her, she’s very old, Frosh. But that’s not gonna stop Evangeline from giving you a good time.”",stories,Evangeline Wants To Bone You,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lpb8zi/evangeline_wants_to_bone_you/,1613926671.0

80,Citronpaw,1613949050,"So, my family and I were traveling in Amsterdam a few years back visiting family. We also were couchsurfer members and often had people crash on our couch. This time we had a guy from England if I recall.

In his stroke of luck my mom asked me if I would go with him around Amsterdam, get me out of the house and occupy this guy.Mind you I was around... 21... at the time?

With about 20 Euro in my pocket and a companion we quickly get onto the tram to head into downtown.

Of course the guy being a male, in Amsterdam steers me towards the Red Light District. I'd been through before with another group of people and was used to the idea of woman scantily clad in the window motioning seductively for my companions to join them.

I turn around half way down the main drag and realize the guy is gone. Flat out gone. I do a little bit of searching but I know what's happened. So I find a localized place to sit and wait.

Suddenly Dutch police men are surrounding me.

""Excuse me, do you need help"" one asks me.

I replied that no, I was just waiting for my 'friend' to get back from wherever he was.

The police told me this was a very unsafe area for someone my age, and sex. So they would be more than happy to take me home. I was about to leave when I hear my name called out. And there, low and behold is the guy who was supposed to be hanging out with me. Who abandoned me in the RLD (Red Light District) of Amsterdam.

I explained the situation to the police men, and thanked them for helping me and keeping me company until he had returned.

My mom was going to gut him for that. He told me with a dumb smerk on his face that he had a great time with a lap dance for 15 Euro, and how amazing it had been. He was not going to just get demolished by my mom for leaving me alone without telling me where he was going. Oh no. I had a plan for how to get back at him.

On our way out of the RLD I found a really nice small sex toy shop and asked him if he minded if we stopped in here. He was a little hesitant but agreed reluctantly. Once inside I took a deep breath and resolved to make this the most glorious payback ever.

The man who ran the store came up to me and welcomed me and my friend in. Thanking him I began carousing the wears. Asking my 'friend' what he thought of this dildo, or that one.Mind you I'd never been in a sex shop before. So this was all new to me, I was scared and embarrassed as hell, but did I let him know that? No. I did not!

Finally after a couple of minutes looking, I bring one to the man tending the store and asked him what he thought about this product. He said it was a popular one, but not what he thought of as the best. So I asked him what he'd recommend and he brought out a very natural looking dildo, handed it to me and began listing off the specs like it was a computer. I admired his ability to sell a dildo.

I listened and was acting interested, feeling the material, etc. By this time I notice the guy I was with was shifting on his feet uncomfortably, and visibly upset. I call him over and show him the dildo. I even pulled on the material to show him just how good the silicon was. And pulled the head of the penis almost pulled it a foot longer than the dildo itself. At this point his face turns pale and he just wants to get out of the store. Perhaps I should have let him off there, but I wasn't too happy with the mark I left on him. So I talk to the guy selling and begin negotiating with him.  Half way though my 'friend' is beginning to beg to leave, and I told him I was almost done.

I finally negotiated down a good enough price I walked out of the store with a pale man at my side, 5 euro left in my pocket. And a bright purple dildo in my bag.

I don't know what ever happened to that dildo, but I had it framed on my wall for several years, unused in mint condition.

And that's my story of how I got back at a man for abandoning me in the RLD of Amsterdam.",stories,Storytime in Amsterdam,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lp974i/storytime_in_amsterdam/,1613920250.0
81,Emradinn,1613946488," 

His very first memory was of himself crying in a closet, his parents screaming their hearts out at each other in the entrance hallway. Their words didn’t make much sense to him at the time, but he still remembered the feeling of being afraid, alone and terrified at the incomprehensible anger they were putting on display. He was three then. The memory came to a grand finale with his father smacking the door shut, not to be seen much of again, and his mother curled up in the corner of the sofa, still yelling, crying… and pointing at him all the while.

His consequent early childhood memories were somewhat of a blur. There had been a lot of moving, as his mother had decided to shed her past life to look for better pastures. Then somewhere along his adolescent years began the memories of what would be a long streak of stepfathers, accompanied by violence, abuse and drugs. Here and there were sprinkles of joy, and genuine childhood memories he cared for, but for the most part, the only thing his childhood left inside him, were bitter feelings of anger and hatred… Lots of hatred. 

At the age of sixteen he ran away and began living off the streets. His parents hadn’t given him much, but from their behaviour and broken promises alone, he’d developed a keen nose for bullshit. That alone kept him alive long enough to realize, that no one in the world looks out for anyone else but themselves. Altruism always came with ulterior motives. 

Now, he was eighteen, staring down the barrel of a gun, very much afraid and sweating profusely. On the other side of the gun, stood *Kansas*. Kansas was what some would call, a connoisseur. To Caleb, he was a dealer, *his* dealer, and in this particular case he was a very pissed off dealer. Caleb, despite his silver tongue and quick wit, had *not* gotten away with “*the heist of the century”,*  and was now about to pay dearly for trying to steal weed worth more than a decent house in the suburbs. A house with double parking…

And a toolshed…

Tools included...

“Did you *really…* Think that you’d get away with this Cale-head?” Kansas pressed the gun against Caleb’s forehead and gave it a solid push.

Caleb flailed with his hands for a rough second, before he landed on his ass with a thud that echoed somewhat flatly between the containers surrounding them. 

“Did you *really?!* Think that you could rob ME!?” Kansas pointed the gun at his own chest, then back towards Caleb. “Have you *any* idea… How many years I’ve spent building this Empire, and how many squirms like yourself I’ve had to deal with?” Kansas smacked his tongue in frustration, and before Caleb could react, the gun went off. 

He’d been stabbed in the arm once. He’d also gotten beatings since first grade, and taken on more than enough tough love from his many step-parents, but nothing, could compare to the searing pain of being shot in the stomach. He yelled… Or at least he thought he did. His world was in shambles, and nothing felt real, not even his own voice. 

“Listen, kid.” Caleb was indeed yelling, really, really loud. “Hey!? Are you listening!!” Kansas took two quick steps forward, and kicked Caleb right where he’d shot him. “I’m fucking talking to you!” Kansas’s voice was trembling with anger. 

The pain made Caleb black out for a second, but before he could get any real relief from passing out, the pain brought him back to reality just as quickly, and this time with a vengeance. Having no prior experience with this kind of agony, his body started convulsing making him vomit violently. He was too shocked to be shocked about seeing that most of his vomit seemed to be blood that he was positive was supposed to be inside him, not gushing out of his mouth like that. The taste of iron and vomit made him vomit again, and he could feel the world slowly becoming colder.

“Look kid, I’m sorry. You know, sometimes I gotta make examples of thieves.” He aimed the gun at Caleb’s head. 

“No…” Caleb felt his entire body scream with pain, as he mustered every ounce of life he had left to put his hand in front of his face, caked with blood and vomit. His voice cracked, and he felt tears beginning to take form in the corner of his eyes. “Please.. No..” His hand fell back down, as his body felt suddenly powerless, and cold. 

“There are always consequences kid.” Kansas sighed, and pulled the trigger. 

Caleb had thought about death many times. He was born in a time when raw greed had destroyed most of earth, and humanity was teeming on a cliff heading towards catastrophic decline. People were still bothered about the color of skin, of who was and wasn’t worthy of love, and not least who was allowed to love who. Suicide had become a gnawing thought at the back of his head that made him strangely okay with the encroaching cold that was slowly eating away at the corners of his consciousness. That last gunshot, he knew was aimed at his head and the fact that he was still thinking, meant that either the remnant pink jelly in his head was struggling to keep a sense of self intact, or the bullet missed, and he had died, or was about to be, considering blood in vomit not being the best of signs last time he checked.

He allowed the cold to creep further in, and in the process he felt it transform into something akin to that warm embrace his mother gave him, back when he was three, after she was done crying and yelling. He could feel his tears drip down his cheek. They were warm, and left cold streaks that stung as a breeze caught his face. He knew, deep inside, that she loved him… At least she did, back then when he didn’t have a personality she had to relate to. 

“*What a weird thing to think about*” Caleb thought to himself. And as the seconds went by, and his consciousness kept fixating on trying to figure out why it was still conscious, Caleb himself realized that he was still, in fact, very much conscious. And still in pain.“*What a weird thing to think about*” Caleb thought to himself. And as the seconds went by, and his consciousness kept fixating on trying to figure out why it was still conscious, Caleb himself realized that he was still, in fact, very much conscious. And still in pain. He opened his eyes carefully, just a little, but enough to make his reflexes involuntarily kick in, forcing his eyes to very dumbly gander at his surroundings, which, to his surprise, were nothing like the docks of death and gloom where he'd been shot, only seconds before.

In fact, Caleb was pretty sure that for some reason, he wasn't even on Earth anymore… His brain was too far gone to even care about registering the massive pain overload that it was experiencing, so it decided to instead enjoy the scenery, pretending that the pain was just bad taco’s. 

Although, it coming to terms with the fact that its meat-bot was now somehow lying on a green grassed slope feeling a gentle and strangely sweet breeze, all the while being studied and prodded with a stick held by what seemed to be an outlandishly tall woman in what looked like a really good fantasy cosplay, her flaming red hair flowing in the breeze, and casually standing next to her what definitely *had* to be an elf, was not going to go down easy.

*“Thrufr diC hen vahKnh?”* The red haired giant looked over at her friend, whom in turn turned and looked at Caleb.

*“DiC thakr dhet sau ovAuntlig!”* The elf cosplayer looked at the red haired giant cosplayer and, nodded? Caleb’s brain couldn’t tell. In fact it wasn’t sure it was capable of staying awake much longer.

What it no certainly could no longer do, was convince itself that it was tacos making the stomach burn. And before it could think about it anymore than that, the lights turned off.

Part 1: The Chosen

Creed

Sir Astor Creed rode on horseback through the woods with only one thought on his mind. He had to get to the village and stop the massacre. He had been riding for hours now and his body grew weary with exhaustion. He kicked his horse again hurrying her. He knew she could take it, she was the best mount a man could ask for. 

Wether riding into battle or venturing across the lands, Margo was dependable, rock solid and at times downright extraordinary. She had been with him for most of his life and she had never failed him, not even once. 

As he rounded the corner Creed saw a sight that he knew he would never forget for the rest of his days. There was a battalion of the royal army, the most trusted and experienced knights of the king, lighting torches and hurling them through the windows of the cottages in a small fishing village. There were villagers running in the streets, screaming out for their loved ones. 

The members of the royal army, maybe 50 or 60 of them, rode on horse back, trampling innocents in their way. Creed saw a young boy fall beneath the hooves of a warhorse and watched in horror as the boys skull was crushed by the horses stomping hooves. 

He kicked Margo again this time with intensity and they lurched forward full speed into the fray. As he approached, several of the royal army members called out to him to stop, but he had not come this far and done this much just to be stopped by these men. 

They might have been experienced knights but he was Sir Astor Creed, the kings most trusted advisor and right hand man. The greatest knight in all the lands as some called him. Creed was a humble man, even with all of his accomplishments and accolades he still just saw him self as a soldier, a grunt in the kings army. 

He felt as if the only reason he had been raised as high as he had was because he and the king had grown up side by side. He had been the kings squire as a boy when he was just a prince, only two years older then Creed. They had formed a bond, not unlike brothers, and had been at each other's side ever since. 

They had rode to battle together, defeated army's together, they had even ended a rebellion when they were only young men. Since his coronation however, the king had been a different man. As it usually does power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The prince that he had known was gone, only the king remained and Creed held no love for the king. 

The royal army saw him approach and turned in shock. They would not of expected him, he was last seen months ago when he escaped his execution. 
As the light fell over his face he saw recognition dawn on their faces and heard weapons being drawn. 

One member launched a spear so close that creed heard it cutting through the air as it whizzed by his ear. Several arrows scattered the landscape as Margo weaved in and out of them at top speed as only she could. Creed unsheathed his sword, the metallic sound echoed back to him as the members of the royal army did the same. 

Creed launched from Margo’s back and tackled one of the nearest Knights to the ground. He knew he was ridiculously out numbered but he could not let these men kill any more innocent people, he was the only one who could stop them. He stabbed the man in the heart with his sword as they fell, impaling him into the ground. He landed roughly on top of the mans corpse and had to immediately roll to avoid being trampled. 

He leapt to his feet pulling his sword from the ground and slicing off an approaching members arm. He screamed in pain as blood squirted from his shoulder painting the cobblestone path red. Creed had no time to react, he was surrounded on all sides by hostile men, incredibly trained men at that. He ran through the battalion slashing and ducking and blocking, killing many men. He saw villagers cowering under the wreckage that had once been their homes and felt another surge of anger towards his adversaries. 

He jumped out of the way as a mace came flying from overhead missing him by inches. He reached down to his hip and extracted a dagger and threw it end over end as hard as he could in return. It was a direct hit, straight into his right eye. The knight screamed in agony as he fell from his horse and was trampled by his own men. There was nothing for creed to do, he knew he was fighting a losing battle. 

He was exhausted from the long ride and he was only one man. He fought valiantly but he could never defeat this many men, this was a fools errand yet his honour would not allow him to leave it lie. He had to defend these people, he had sworn an oath. He got slashed by a passing spear on his left shoulder, causing him to cry out in pain and miss a step in his current battle. It was all the other man needed as he spun, slashing creed’s sword arm and across the front of his body. 

Creed fell too his knees as his sword clattered down to the ground in front of him. He picked it up but was Immediately kicked in the back by yet another member of the royal army. His head collided with the path as he felt the breath flood from his chest. Creed knew this was his last dash, his run of good luck had come to an end. The royal army all dismounted surrounding him, swords drawn. As they approached Creed suddenly had an idea, it was crazy, but just maybe it could save his life. 

The royal army were laughing as they approached, sure the battle was over and that they had won. Just as they closed in on Creed, he rolled on his back and pulled his fingers too his mouth, whistling as loud as he could. The soldiers moved a little quicker towards him, not knowing what was coming next. Just as one of the royal army reached down to pull Creed off of the ground, Margo burst into action. 

She galloped from out of nowhere rearing on her hind legs and kicking a nearby soldier in the face with such ferocity that he sailed through the air collided with a nearby cottage. He lay in the ruin, unmoving and surely dead. 

The soldiers turned their attention to Margo, trying with everything that they had to bring her down. She was too fast though galloping in and out of ruined and burning cottages, dodging everything they threw at her and kicking the occasional soldier. Creed leapt from the ground and several nearby soldiers, noticing this, turned back to him ready to attack. 

Before Creed could even raise his sword, Margo galloped over and booted the closest man in the chest with her hind legs sending him flying into his companions knocking six of them to the ground. Creed didn't hesitate launching onto Margo’s back, throwing another dagger at a nearby soldier as he did, killing him. Margo galloped lightning fast through the village, leaping over corpses and burning wreckage as she went. 

Creed held on for dear life as spears, arrows, chunks of wood, and any other objects the remaining members of the royal army could get their hands on came flying passed them. Margo got clipped on her right flank by an arrow but it didn't even slow her. Creed spun around on her back and saw that only 10 or 15 men remained. He knew that at least 4 or 5 would have to return to the kings palace and relay the news of the attack, even more would surely follow him, the massacre was over. 

He patted Margo on the head thanking her for her help as she sprinted even faster straight for the ancient mountain. The royal army would pursue them but she knew she had a lead on them now. They would never follow her where she was going anyway, they just had to make it to the mountain. 

As Creed saw where they were headed he tried to turn Margo but she was stubborn. She galloped on at top speed straight for the one place that Creed never thought he would go. They were headed towards the Jungle of the Damned...

Raymond

Raymond Skurt was a lonely man, and that was exactly how he liked it. He had been alone his whole adult life and most of his childhood. Raymond had never been a fighter. He would much rather spend his days curled up in bed reading then out on some battlefield risking his life. 

He was not a coward, he would fight if it was necessary, but he preferred to just stay clear of the fight and mind his own business. Raymond was a mute. He had not uttered a word since he was 14 on one fateful day at his fathers homestead. 

He had been hiding in the attic reading his favourite book for the umpteenth time when his twin brothers Duke and Chad burst in out of breath. Raymond's brothers were much older then he. They were already men at this point, roughly 18 years old. 

They had always picked on Raymond for his tentative ways. They would often drag him from his hiding places and make him there practice dummy in the training yard belting him with wooden swords and lashing him with whips. Raymond did not like to hate, but if he hated anyone in this world it would be the twins. They approached Raymond smiling and grabbed him roughly pulling him too his feet. 

He remembered feeling helpless as Duke grabbed him, squirming, by the scruff of the neck and tossed him over his shoulder like a bag of manure. Raymond kicked and screamed but his brother was just too strong. As they left the attic he stopped resisting and let himself be carried, knowing there was no point in resistance. Chad walked by Dukes side smiling wide as they headed to yet again harass their younger brother. As they rounded the corner both brothers lost the colour in their face and Duke dropped Raymond roughly to the ground. 

There, striding towards them, was their father with one of the most important looking men Raymond had ever seen by his side. He wore plum coloured robes and many golden chains. He didn't know much about royalty or citizens from the royal city, but Raymond was certain this man was a lord. He got too his feet dusting himself off and saw his father grimace as he noticed Raymond was there. 

Raymond’s father had always been ashamed of him as a son. He was a smith, one of the best in all of the lands, and he had hoped Raymond would follow in his footsteps. Once he had shown no joy in battle or training, Howard Skurt had brought Raymond into his business as an assistant, hoping he would have a hand at smithing. Unfortunately however Raymond had shown no skill in being a smith and with that his father had given up hope and basically disowned him as a son. 

Howard and the lord approached the three boys, conversing with one another as they did. The twins bowed low to the lord but Raymond, not knowing the usual courtesy when addressing such a man, hesitated a second too long. Raymond realised his mistake and quickly bowed hoping that the lord hadn't noticed. As the two men drew close enough however, he heard his father apologising to the man. ‘He is a simple boy my lord,’ he heard his father say, ‘ he knows not proper courtesy please forgive me for his stupidity’. 

As they got closer Raymond noticed that the lord was quite young, younger even then the twins, only slightly older then himself. He felt awkward watching his father address this boy with such fear in his eyes, like he was addressing the king himself. ‘I forgive you Skurt but the boy must be punished,’ he heard the lord reply, making his blood run cold.
‘Of course my lord, whatever punishment you see fit,’ he heard his father reply, his voice unusually high, ‘he has always been a disgrace’. He emphasised his point by spitting on the floor inches from Raymond's face. 

Raymond felt an uncontrollable rage, one he had never felt before that day nor a single day since, boiling in his stomach. His father had treated him like dirt for too long. Raymond sprung too his feet with a scream startling both his father and the lord who took a step back, a look of fear on his face. Raymond ran screaming not for his father, but for the young lord. He would prove to his father he was not a disgrace, he was planning on attacking this lord and showing his father he was not a coward. 

He approached the lord screaming, flailing his arms like a raving lunatic. The lord back peddled so fast he tripped over his own feet falling to the floor. ‘GAURDS!!’ He screamed as Raymond got close, preparing to dive for the man cowering on the floor. As Raymond reached out his arms, preparing to wrap his hands around the lords throat, he was grabbed roughly from behind and hoisted into the air. 

The lord regained his feet and smiled as Chad, holding a flailing Raymond in the air out of reach, slammed him against the stone wall. Raymond felt his head crack against the hard stone and instantly felt the warm blood trickling down the back of his neck. His head spun and all of the anger that was coursing through him disappeared, being replaced by fear as he saw the hopeless situation in front of him. 

Chad held him with his forearm up against his throat choking the air from his lungs. Duke stood behind him, a smile on his face, ready to inflict some damage of his own. The lords guards came racing down the corridor and withdrew their weapons, surveying the scene. Howard stood off to the side, a look of mingled anger and shock on his face staring at his son and shaking his head. The lord dusted himself off and with a great smile pulled a dagger from his belt as he approached Raymond. 

Over the years Raymond had blocked most of the next part out. All that he remembered was the lord asking why he did what he did. When he didn't respond he had tortured him, slicing him with his dagger in front of his father and brothers. None of them lifted a finger to help. Eventually the lord had removed his tongue saying that if he wouldn't talk today then he would never talk again. When Raymond thought back to that day now he couldn't remember why he didn't talk. Why he didn't just tell the lord why he had attacked him. It didn't matter now. 

Raymond had run away as soon as he was healed. He stole one of his fathers horses in the night and escaped while his family slept. He rode until he found this small village half a world away from his fathers homestead on the side of the ancient mountain. It was a place of legend, one that it was told harboured a great evil. At the peak of the mountain sat the jungle of the damned, a cursed place from which men never returned. 

Raymond had never heard those stories, more intent on burying himself in his books then hearing the stories outside in the real world. He had settled in the little village and lived a simple life. He could no longer speak but he could still work and he worked hard in the fields to keep himself fed. He spent his free time reading or fishing down at the lake, life was peaceful. Raymond closed his book and put out the candle on his window sill. 

He yawned and stretched his arms wide as he walked across the room and dis robed, preparing for bed. As he fluffed his pillow he heard a noise outside his window that made him glance out. He saw smoke rising from the base of the mountain, someone had set a fire down in the fishing village off the lake. Raymond thought that maybe he would go down there in the morning and make sure everything was ok. 

The noise Raymond heard was getting louder, it was a noise he hadn't heard in some time. The sound of hooves on pavement, moving quickly this way. Travellers rarely ventured this far up the mountain. Raymond didn't know why, he assumed it was just too far out of the way, it was for this reason that Raymond had settled here in the first place. Less travellers meant less chance his father could ever find him. 

Raymond walked back across the room and put his robe back on securing it tightly as he made for the front door. He was a curious man and he wanted to know who was coming up the mountain, something told him it was important. As he opened the front door Raymond saw the last thing he ever expected to see. 

A man in full armour, the best armour Raymond had ever seen, rode into view. He slowed to a canter and dismounted beside a horse trough sticking his whole head in and drinking deeply. The horse walked up beside him and began to drink as well. Raymond stood at the door of his cottage watching, his mouth hanging open at the sight. 

It wasn't the man that interested him, it was the horse. He looked back to the man in the trough and felt a burst of courage flow through him. He didn't care who this man was he had Raymond's horse, and he wanted her. By the end of this night Raymond vowed to himself that he would have Margo back...

Eliza

Eliza Wolfe scurried around her room collecting her belongings at breakneck speed. She shoved everything she needed into her pack and scoured the room for anything she might have missed. A tear trickled down her face as she picked up the dagger she had hidden under her mattress and tucked it into a hidden sheath in her belt. It had been her brothers, the last thing he had ever given her before his death many years ago. Eliza was not what you would call a proper lady. She was a beautiful young women with shoulder length brown hair which framed her pretty face. She had always been a gorgeous girl but she had never wanted to be a lady, not in the proper sense of the word. 

Her virtue remained intact and even though she had spent almost half of her life in prison, she felt as if she would still be a virgin even if she hadn't. She did not want to be a wife nor a mother and the thought of any man inside of her made her sick to her stomach. She was happy spending the rest of her life without knowing the touch of a man if it meant she never had to be a mother or a wife. 

Eliza had always wanted to be a warrior. Despite her size and unassuming appearance, Eliza was blessed with the skill of an archer. She was a natural, from the first time she picked up a bow she had shown great skill. She had trained, wether alone or with her brother for years now and her skills had become incredible. She could out shoot even the best of her fathers archers and her brother had always told her she was the best natural archer he had ever seen, and he had seen plenty. 

Eliza's father did not share her enthusiasm for archery. He was a high lord in the kingdom, Lord Edmund Wolfe, son of the last wolf king Hector Wolfe and he would not have his daughter wasting her time on some archery range. He had always wanted Eliza to be a lady, to take some man in marriage and father him some grandchildren. With her brother dead she was his last hope for any male descendants to pass his seat to. If he were to die right now the seat could be claimed by any other high lord. 

By the rules of the lands women were not fit to sit on a lords seat so Lord Edmund demanded from Eliza the one thing she would never give him, children. As Eliza packed the last of her belongings and secured her pack to her back she thought back to the day years ago that had started these events in motion. The day her whole life changed. It was the day after her brothers death and Eliza was grief stricken, hiding in her chambers. She was only 13 years of age but she had the heart of a lion. She feared no one, but her brothers death had shaken her more then she ever could of imagined. Her father had come to see her to explain that they were surrendering to the king. 

The prince and his men had made short work of her brothers rebellion, catching him and his men from behind with a sneak attack. Despite all of that however, her father being the coward that he was, was going to bend a knee to the king. Eliza was incensed, she told her father she would not bow to the man that had her brother killed. Her father had called her a stupid child and slammed the door as he left her chamber, locking her inside. Eliza had been furious, trashing her chambers and destroying her possessions. After some time she began to calm and had come up with a plan. 

For years Eliza's father had been locking her in her room from time to time. When she wouldn't comply to his orders or when she would get caught practicing at the archery range. She had escaped many times and she knew exactly how to get out and back in without getting noticed. She would not let the man who ordered the death of her brother just go on living like it had never happened, even if he was the king. She had loved her brother more then she had ever loved anything in this world and the king and his son had taken him from her. 

She demanded justice and if her father was too much of a coward to administer it, then she would. She rushed to the window with a plan forming in her mind. She had to get close to the king without being recognised. She knew that if her father saw her he would have her taken back to her chambers and locked up, this time for real. She had only one chance and she wasn't going to waste it. As she climbed down the vines which grew along the out side of the castle walls Eliza knew exactly what she had to do. 

She knew her father and she knew that he would not simply bow before the king. He would go above and beyond to prove his loyalty, he would hold a tourney and have the kings men face off against his own. The ‘Wolf Pack’ as her fathers soldiers were collectively known were skilled, fiercely trained warriors, but they were nothing compared to the members of the royal army. The tourney was more or less her father sending his own men to die to appease the Kings wrath. 

As Eliza clambered the rest of the way down the wall and jumped down to the ground she saw people making their way towards the stadium in enormous crowds, proving her theory about the tourney. She knew she had to conceal her identity if her plan was to work so she pulled the hood of her cloak up to cover her face as she made her way through the swelling crowds in the streets towards the armoury. Eliza was determined to right the wrongs committed against her family and nothing would get in her way, not even the royal army. 

As she got closer to the armory she noticed more then a dozen members of the royal army standing guard around the front door. They wore robes of plum which hung around gold plated armour. Engraved on the chest piece was a purple crown surrounded by bright orange flames, the symbol of the royal family. Every member had the visor down on his helm making it impossible to make out their faces. They all stood completely still like sentries observing the crowd as they passed searching for any kind of disturbance. 

Eliza pulled her hood a little tighter at the sight of them and veered off in the other direction heading for the rear door. As she approached she found it unguarded which she had expected. She was the only person in the world who could get through that door, even her father didn't have a key. Her brother had stolen it years ago and given it to Eliza so that she could go down and practice archery without having to explain herself to the wolf pack. 

She approached the door and moved the stack of crates her and her brother had placed there obscuring view of the door. She fit her key into the rusted old lock, doing her best to keep out of sight and silent. She managed to slip through the door without being noticed and headed straight for her bow which was hidden in the far back corner of the room behind a rack of maces. 

After retrieving her bow and a full quiver of arrows she continued to the next room where she knew the armour was kept all the while making sure her footsteps were as quiet as possible. She saw her normal leather archers armour on the rack on the left but continued past it knowing that her father would recognise her in it. She instead chose a full set of low weight metal armour from the rack usually reserved for soldiers in training. 

She adjusted it as tight as it would go but still it hung loosely around her thin body. The armour, being designed for a young man, hid all of her womanly shape from sight and as she picked up the helm and pulled down the visor she felt sure that she would not be recognised. She looked exactly like a young warrior and no one, not even her father, would see through her disguise so long as she did not lose her helm. 

She quietly sneaked back out of the rear door locking it behind her and re-joining the now dwindling crowd. Everyone in the city and many people from other parts of the kingdom had come to see the great Wolfe dynasty bend and break under the foot of the crown. Most of the people and combatants were inside the stadium, taking their seats. 

Eliza had been to many of these tourneys throughout her life and she knew that the archery competition would be the first event. It was the only event in the tourney where no one would be killed, it was more a matter of pride then anything. Eliza headed to the back gate of the stadium with the rest of the warriors and competitors, praying she would not be discovered. To her relief the stadium guards waved her through, proving to her that her disguise was working. 

She was ushered in and bustled over towards the other archers who all looked at her oddly. It was customary for archers to wear leather armour, especially in a tourney, as it was lighter and easier too manoeuvre in. Wearing a helm also was not only risky, it was down right stupid if one wanted to win, her line of sight being majorly affected by the visor. Eliza wasn't in the tournament to lose however and she did not need her entire line of sight to beat these men. A horn sounded and the archers were all shoved forward by the guards. 

Eliza joined them and was ushered out onto the archery range where she took her place in front of a target side by side with the other archers. The tournament began and Eliza quickly earned the respect of the crowd with impressive shots each round, every one in the bullseye. Even with her visor down Eliza outshot every man in the tournament with ease eventually being declared champion. The crowd went ballistic jumping to their feet and cheering louder then Eliza had ever heard a crowd cheer for an archer. She bowed low to the crowd, a sign of respect, and they roared even louder. 

After a minute or so the king stood to his feet and the crowd slowly fell silent. He signalled to his guards to bring Eliza forward and they ushered her silently towards the podium where the winners were declared champion by the king. She looked up to where the king stood and saw her father sitting beside him. His head was down, he looked like a broken man. On the other side of the king stood the prince. 

His long unkempt hair hung in curtains around his face. Eliza thought he might have been a good looking young man if he cut his hair and shaved the peach fuzz from his face but the prince had a look on his face that made her resent him even more then she already did. It was a look of smugness. This whole tourney was held in the honour of a victory that the prince had achieved, a victory over her brother. She boiled with rage as she stood there in front of them, the two men that she hated most in this world. Two men who if Eliza had her way would soon be dead. The crowd finally silenced and the king raised his hands to address them. 

‘ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the victor and new champion of archery, I ask now that he please remove his helm so that I can look upon the face of the finest archer in all the lands!’ He finished his declaration and sat back down on his throne, clearly not really caring who Eliza was. The prince however had not taken his eyes off of her since she had taken her first shot in the tournament. She could feel his anticipation as she slowly reached up, grasped her helm and pulled it from her head, throwing it too the ground. 

A loud gasp spread through out the crowd as they all saw her long hair fall down from underneath the helmet. Several people even recognised her, she heard her name being whispered throughout the crowd. She took a step forward on the podium as the king, regaining some interest, stared down at her from above. She knew she only had one shot and she would surely be killed as soon as she took it, but it was worth it to get revenge for her brother. 

Eliza turned to the king, her heart beating so fast in her chest she thought it might explode. ‘I am Eliza Wolfe, descendant of the wolf king and rightful heir to my fathers seat,’ Eliza began, the crowd growing silent at her words. ‘I came here today and deceived you all for two reasons,’ she continued as her father looked up with fear in his eyes, silently begging her not to do what he knew she was about to do. 

‘The first reason was to prove to the king and to the people of all the lands that women are not second rate and with the right training they can not just be equal but even better then some men’. She heard a disapproving murmur spread throughout the crowd at her words but she also saw several women nodding their heads in agreement. ‘ the second reason,’ continued Eliza steadying herself, preparing for what  was surely her final act, ‘was to avenge my brother’. 

At these words several things happened in a matter of seconds. Members of the royal army burst in from all sides and began to run for Eliza, determined to stop her at all costs. Eliza reached back and drew an arrow and notched it with surprising speed aiming directly for the Kings heart. She was tackled to the ground as she let the arrow go, praying that her aim was true. 

She looked up as she was roughly slammed into the ground and saw her arrow sailing straight for the king who had a look of utmost fear on his face. At the last possible second a young knight who Eliza had not noticed before stepped out from behind the king and slashed the arrow in two just as it was about to pierce the Kings skin. Eliza felt defeated as the members dragged her too her feet, blood dripping down her lip from the impact with the ground. The young knight stared down at Eliza with a look of mingled pity and understanding. 

She didn't quite understand that look, ever since that day she had thought about that look and what it had meant. The events that happened after she took a shot at the king had surprised her more then anything else in her entire life. The king had laughed once he had regained his composure. Instead of killing her right there and then or having her hung to set an example he had declared that she would be imprisoned until she was of age to marry when he would marry her to his son the prince. He knew that having her killed was what she expected, this was her worst nightmare. 

Eliza would much prefer to have the crows picking at her dead flesh then have the prince lay a single finger on her. In the years that passed the king had died and the prince had taken the throne. He had never once called on Eliza or tried to get her to marry him, he had no interest in her what so ever. So he left her to rot in her fathers prison cell for almost 10 years, always keeping a watchful eye. She had tried to escape several times from her cell under her fathers castle but had always been prevented by the royal army who now inhabited her fathers city. That was of course until tonight. 

She had finally escaped, avoided the members and snuck back into her chambers. She knew she only had minutes to gather her things and leave before someone realised she was missing. She climbed down the vines on the side of the castle as quickly as possible, praying she would get to the stables without the alarm being raised. As she reached the ground she saw a small group of approaching royal army members and hid in the brush as they passed. 

She noticed one of them had a bow and full quiver of arrows on his back. She knew it was risky and that she would be better off making a run for the stables, but she also knew that if she did not have a bow when the alarm was raised, she was going back to her cell. She crept up behind them hoping to steal the bow before they had any time to react. These men were constantly vigilant however and as she crept closer one of them spun around with a sword holding the tip directly too her throat. 

The other two men spun around as well and smiled in delight at the sight before them. None of them seemed to recognise her and we're pleased simply because a pretty young women was at their mercy. Eliza hated her self for what happened next, but in a desperate situation one must act desperately. She slowly, with a smile started to unbutton her bodice, revealing her breasts underneath. 

The member lowered his sword ever so slightly as he took in the sight before him, the other two moved in a little closer. As they approached Eliza turned her attentions too the man with the bow. She stroked his cheek and allowed him to fondle her, giggling as he did like some whore in a tavern. She kissed him full on the mouth as the other guards began running there hands all over her. She pulled back from the kiss and quickly extracted her brothers dagger from her belt hiding it in the palm of her hand as all three men started pulling at her clothes breathing heavily as they did. 

Eliza let them work, holding the dagger tightly in her hand waiting for her moment. Just as the last layer of her clothes fell to the ground Eliza spun around digging the daggers tip into the throat of the man behind her. The other two watched in shock as their friends neck opened up like flood gates and blood poured down over Eliza's arm and on to the ground. Before either of the other men could react Eliza burst into action. 

She threw the dagger straight into the shoulder of the man with the bow distracting him and making him cry out in agony. She then smashed her elbow into the bridge of his nose shattering it and removed an arrow from his quiver as she left him laying in a heap on the ground. She launched at the third man with the arrow stabbing it as hard as she could straight into his eye sending him too his knees screaming in agony. She stood over them, three members of the most elite fighting force in the world, dead or dying at her feet. 

Her naked body was covered in blood and as she approached the man with the bow he looked up at her with a dying look, fear beyond any fear Eliza had ever seen before. ‘Who are you?’ He whispered as she leaned in close extracting her dagger. ‘I am vengeance’ she whispered back as she plunged the dagger directly into the mans heart. He stared back silently coughing and gurgling up blood and then eventually he remained still. 

Eliza withdrew her dagger just as the rain started to pour. She stood, naked covered in blood in the pouring rain and couldn't help but smile. She would avenge her brother, if it was the last thing she ever did...",stories,The Jungle Of The Damned - Part 1 Chapter 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lp6ijv/the_jungle_of_the_damned_part_1_chapter_1/,1613912449.0

On a summer hot day, it had became a day to where game-crossed lovers looked back on. A girl and a boy had stumbled upon each other, online through a game. The girl had enjoyed playing with the boy and had demanded another play with him. She had sent a friend request following an invite. After and on forwards, they’ve played together for longer than a week. During those days, the girl had been thinking about asking the guy for his media forms to talk more outside of games. And one day she had the confidence to ask him, heart beating so fast, butterflies all over the place. Scared of a rejection of him saying no but he had made her happy by giving it to her. More weeks later they’ve been texting up a storm everyday, every night. Those nights to the girl became something she really craved and feelings started rattling in her. A day came where she was out of town on vacation, she was bored and was craving to hear a soothing tone. Again an urge of confidence had came about. With the confidence she asked the guy if he was down for a call. He had said yes. Her heart stopped in happiness. Sun setting in the distance, sitting on the edge of the pool, feet dangling in the water with earbuds hanging from her ear, the girl was genuinely happier than ever talking to someone so important to her, that she met in so little time. Soon a day came where she turned on her camera and asked to see him. The boy said he was ugly and wouldn’t be of worth to see but she kept begging and he soon broke. Heart beating so fast, anxiously watching the screen, there he was. Finally able to see him, she had freaked out inside. Seeing the boy for the first time and finding him to be attractive. With more calls and more deep conversations every day, the boy and girl had become much closer in a instant in just a few weeks. Closer like they’ve known each other for years. But lately both had started becoming busy. The girl was somewhat patient and would wait on the guy for many hours. Soon later, they become a little distant but had still texted each other when each other had time. But the girl was always free and always waiting for a text.

85,xuxi0ne,1613936250," This is a long story, but I won't write down everything, just things I consider odd. I go to a sports club and there are many kids of my age and younger. The first weird thing i'd like to mention is that a guy is staring at me from a distance, crossing roads with me lots of times(at first i didn't pay attention to it), disappearing for a month then showing up whenever i'm there, i even asked a friend of mine because i felt it was suspicious, and since that friend rarely misses lessons just said that ""now that you say it i didn't really see him around unless his parents force him, but when you're here he's here too"" it could be a coincidence though. apparently he told other people that he likes me and a week ago i overheard a convo ""hey does \[his name\] still like \[my name\]?"" but i didnt hear answer. anyways, months before he did something worth mentioning. he took a creepshot of me and showed it to his friends, and bringed it up 2 or 3 times that day. once i walked beside his gathered-together group of friends and i heard a dude say ""geez quit flexing we get it you took a pic of her"". i dont know if he realized what he did is quite illegal. i dont know man this looks like a major red flag to me, why would anyone take pics of someone else without their permission. how do i know if didnt send it to all of his buddies or something? and on that same day he sent 2 friends of his to talk with me, a girl and a guy. the girl asked where i live and i told her that i live in another city. she cant do much with that info. she did a bit of small talk, we engaged a bit then went off. then the guy also talked to me but not that much of info gathering. when everyone was supposed to go home, he gathered his friends again and i saw him talk with the exact same girl and dude. i was in the changing room and they were whispering so i couldn't make out what they said. the said guy didnt approach me, he just winded up near me whenever he could, but not in a pattern that's very noticeable. sometimes he'd sit on a seat behind me, on a seat before me, or one time he sat beside me. he also tends to eavesdrop on my conversations with other people, he just stays around, talks to some people and sometimes goes dead quiet just to listen to what i say, without actually engaging with me in a convo. sometimes i caught him staring then he'd just abrubtly look away, or stand up and go somewhere, or turn his head away slowly as if he wasn't looking. one time i think he stole my water bottle(it's a plain plastic water bottle the one u could get at any supermarket) because i saw it with him on another day, i recognized it as mine because it had a line on it with a black marker. i didnt ask him about it, inside my mind i just went like ""noted"" then he disappeared for a while again. 2 weeks later he showed up with a coat that looked similar to mine, color and even the lenght. he sometimes talks to people im friends with, which is weird because he has a fixated group of friends and many times rejected people who were trying to get close to him. he especially talked to my friends when i was nearby doing something. i also got a new phonecase and he got one that looks like mine too. one of his close friends started talking to me on social media, one of my friends gave him my contact info.. we started talking about interests and stuff. i mentioned programming and that i'm good at x thing and bad at y, stuff like this. few days later i eavesdrop in his conversation, when he was in the changing rooms with his friend, suddenly i heard them talk about programming and c language. this is cool it most likely is something theyre interested in, then i heard something that made me feel a bit uneasy ""what else did she tell you? ask her if she likes \[something\] next time"" well that something hasnt been asked and they couldve been talking about someone else. most of this could be a coincidence, or the guy would like to be my friend or something and he's making a plan for it idk man, or he's just trying to impersonate me for whatever reason..",stories,An odd story of an awkward teen(me),https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lp4por/an_odd_story_of_an_awkward_teenme/,1613907450.0

87,TrogTheFrog,1613933584,"It was 7th grade.  I grew up in an incredibly white school district. The only minorities in the entire school were 2 black kids, 1 Chinese kid, and 1 Muslim kid.

In 7th grade, we had a black teacher who taught us social studies/history.  He was one of the formative teachers in my life.  He had a shaved head and a Santa Claus body.  He was probably in his early 40s.  He was the the kindest, most gentle person I had ever met.  Soft spoken, but serious.  He was always fair, but he was firm with the rules.

I’ll always remember the time he made me stand up for an entire class period because I kept falling asleep every day in his class.  We later had an assignment where we had to mail a letter to the school board, telling them how to improve the school.  I never fell asleep in his class again.  My letter told them to start school later in the day because kids like me couldn’t fall asleep early enough to get a good night’s sleep.

This teacher was the first one to teach us about racism from the perspective of a black man who actually understood what it was like.  The story that always stuck with me was a newspaper ad he saw in his 20s for a construction job.  The ad said that you could get a tan while you work.  This teacher has a very dark black man.  He explained to us how this ad made him feel unwelcome to the job.  He understood that the person who wrote the ad was most likely a white guy who didn’t consider how the wording would make a black person feel.

He was the first teacher to introduce us to the darker side of history.  He showed us pictures from the Holocaust, pictures of lynchings of black people, pictures from the Vietnam War.  He always treated this kind of stuff incredibly seriously.  Before showing them to us, he would always make sure that we understood that this stuff was serious  and that he wasn’t going to tolerate anybody who didn’t take it seriously.",stories,The first black teacher I had was very formative on me as a white kid in an almost entirely white school who had never really interacted with any black people before then,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lp3rj9/the_first_black_teacher_i_had_was_very_formative/,1613904784.0
88,MinyMouse27,1613933143,"I still remember that night. I had the perfect life. Great friends, great boyfriend, and a great family. I thought that this life would last forever, but, as things go, nothing lasts forever. That was the night everything changed.

It was 8 in the afternoon, and the party had just gotten started. We were dancing and blasting music, normal party things. My boyfriend, Warner, wasn’t able to make it, along with my friend Mikala. After not being on my phone for a couple hours, Warner got bored and called my best friend, Irelynn. He didn't know I was with her, and continued to complain about me. A wave of anger and confusion washed over me, I lost total control over my body. 

I ran upstairs and sat on the couch. Nick, another guy at the party, came upstairs after me, and things just happened. Things got heated and I felt like I couldn't stop what was happening. When it finally did stop, I realized what I had just done. I got on my phone and proceeded to text Warner and tell him about everything that had happened.

He, rightfully, was very upset. He told Mikala, and they both blew up on me and decided that I was no longer in the group. Getting kicked out of the circle was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Everything was crumbling at my feet. Imagine getting crushed by a truck, and that's what I felt. I felt like I wanted to climb into a dark hole, and never climb out. I lost all motivation to do everything in my life, I could barely even smile. Everything felt forced and I didn’t know what to do, or how to fix it. At times, I didn’t even want to be alive. I felt as though everything would be better if I was gone. I almost acted on it until I looked at it from an outside view.

I loved mikala so much, and losing her was my worst fear, but she's just a person in the vast array of others. In 5 years, this whole night would’ve been long forgotten. No one would remember how I had made out with Nick. Sure, that memory will always be there, but it would be old news. Things would blow over. Ending my own life would do more bad than good.

After that night, I started focusing on myself and school. I learned how to love somebody. I learned how to make the perfect relationship.

89,3CoffeeProblem,1613930241,"I was recently reminded that I saved a life, once. 

I was walking... somewhere in Ottawa, Ontario in the middle of winter. I was with my girlfriend at the time. I was going to Carleton University. 

The snow was 3+ feet deep, and it was -20 or -30 Celsius. 

I heard a little sound like a kid crying, and looked around. Over the snowbank, I saw a house with a screen door about 1/3 open, and moving a bit. 

I put 2 and 2 together and walked up the path to see a little girl wearing nothing but a diaper standing outside. She’d clearly let herself out, and couldn’t get back in. “Accessible” doorhandles are not that great an idea. 

So I pounded on the door, and took three long steps back. Mom came to the door, shit her pants and scooped up her little one, and took her inside. 

Christina stayed at the street through all this, for some reason. That I remember.

91,JamesHubs,1613923612," 

The worst job I ever worked at was at a door manufacturer, where I operated a large, computer controlled machine that trimmed the perimeter of doors and cut out the handle holes all in one process. You had to pay close attention to how you orientated the doors on the table because the hinges needed to be on the correct side. If not, you could ruin a door that costs up to $800 dollars. Speaking of doors, have you ever had to lift a solid oak door? Let me tell you, I consider myself to be stronger than the average man, and I *struggled* to lift these things on to the vacuum table. We didn’t have any special tools or mechanisms to help out, we had to use our brawn alone. At the end of the day my back would be killing me, I would routinely have to load over 60 of these big, heavy doors throughout the entire day. Occasionally the machine would run over a rogue screw and make a bad noise, or the door would pop off of the vacuum table and ruin the whole process. It was *extremely* noisy, I don’t often use the word “extreme” but in this case it warrants it. One time I used my phone to measure the decibel level during the machining process and it regularly hit 115 decibels. All day long.  

We also had a near-impossible quota to hit for how many doors we had to machine in a day. We were supposed to hit 180 per day between the two machines and we struggled to hit 120. This meant that the CEO of the company would routinely have discussions with us about productivity and the importance of time management. After a couple days on the job I was dubious as to whether that 180 mark was even possible. I actually timed on how long it took to machine 10 doors and averaged that time out throughout the entire day. Without accounting for breaks, lunch, errors, or anything else that might come up, we could machine a maximum of 150 doors per day. It was literally impossible. Yet, our department was constantly under scrutiny from the higher ups, and was frequently blamed for the reason the company wasn’t hitting the target numbers. 

There was also a very high turnover rate, almost everyone I talked to was new to the job and the veterans didn’t hesitate to tell me about how bad the supervisors treated the staff. This should have been a huge red flag, but I was still new to the job market and these red flags went in one ear and out the other. Pro tip: if everyone at your new job is new, that’s a very bad sign. To make matters even worse the schedule was horrendous, it was Monday-Thursday 5am to 1:30pm, and Fridays were 4am-12:30pm. Naturally I became sleep deprived during the week and I became depressed and anxious. I won’t get into specifics to what I was getting paid, but I will say it was not a lot and it was through a temp agency so there was zero negotiation. To summarize it all up, it was terrible. I was physically hurting all day from the bending and lifting, my ears rang, I was sleep deprived, depressed and anxious, all the while under the omnipresent thumb of the CEO. 

Believe it or not, those weren’t the reasons I quit. Sure the job sucked, but I was still making decent money (so I thought) and it was tolerable for the time being. To get to the reason why I quit we have to go back to the beginning. When I was hired we had two machines that were each operated by an employee, doing all the described duties from before. The two people who operated these machines were me and another man named Bobby. Bobby was a tall, sarcastic man in his thirties who taught me everything about operating the machine. He also had a temper. He was a good employee, but he never held his tongue about his disdain for the bosses and the working conditions. Especially our shift supervisor, Matt. Matt who was a jovial, plump man with a big beard and everything Bobby wasn’t.  He wasn’t a very good leader but he cared about the job and I liked him. 

Four weeks after I started Bobby and Matt had a falling out and Bobby, like out of a movie, grabbed his things from his locker, yelled, “I quit!” and slammed the door. That could be a story in itself, but more importantly he was our shift lead, and now one of the machines didn’t have an operator. I continued to do my work, processing what has just happened, when Matt calls me in and informs me that I am the new shift lead and I will be operating both machines by myself. Despite having just learned how to operate one machine only four weeks ago. This meant, quite literally, doing double the amount of work, along with supervising two other employees and burdening the responsibility of quality inspection. All the while meeting daily quotas, and without a mention of any increase in my pay. At this point I was still somewhat committed to the company, being a shift lead felt kind of heroic in a way, having so much responsibility felt strangely good. But if I was going to double the amount of work, I rightfully expected to be compensated for it. So I summoned up the courage and talked to the CEO himself, David. David was a neatly put together man who appeared to be in great shape, he was also very cold and I got the feeling he missed out on a lot of his daughter’s school plays. I explained my reasoning, and expected to be offered something. Anything at all would be appreciated. Let’s just say, it didn’t happen how I planned. David, talked in circles about waiting to see how our quotas looked in a couple months and then he’ll see about increasing my pay. In other words, a big, fat no. I’m not an angry person, but I was having angry feelings at this moment. 

I’m not an idiot, I took that conversation as a sign to immediately start looking for another job. I’ve made the mistake before of quitting a job before you have another one lined up, and I knew as much as the job was killing me I had to wait. For a couple weeks I endured hellish amounts of stress and anxiety, I had just learned how to operate one machine and now I was the captain of two of them. I was making mistakes and missing the daily quota by an even larger margin than before. By then there was no mention of introducing another person to operate the second machine, I suspect they figured out they could get away with having just me operate both at the same time. Fortunately, I interviewed at another company, a telescope manufacturer of all things, that was minutes away from where I lived. Did I mention this door job was a half hour commute from my house? Anyway, soon I received a call from the telescope job and was offered a position, but at a two dollar an hour decrease in pay. Roger that. At this point it was just a matter of when I was going to put in my two weeks, after all I was the only machine operator in the company and I didn’t want to leave them empty handed. So I called my wife to hear her advice, and she suggested I tell them to get f\*\*\*ed. That was all the convincing I needed.

So I waited until the day was over, clocked out, took a deep breath and walked over to the department supervisor, Wade, and briefly told him my grievances regarding my pay (pro tip, never tell any more than you have to when quitting), and today was my last day. What Wade said is something I will hear again in the future from other employers, he said that they would have no problem paying me what I wanted. For the briefest moment I considered reversing my decision and staying with the company, but thankfully I stuck to my guns and remained firm. After all, if they thought I was worth more, they would have shown that when they “promoted” me to a shift lead. Brief words were exchanged and I left the office, that’s when I saw David, the CEO. I took another deep breath and gave him the same speech. He looked visibly more angry, and didn’t say much. I figured this was my cue to leave when out of the blue Matt, the shift supervisor who had the falling out with Bobby, walked over to us. David said, “James has something to tell you” and briskly stormed off. Matt gave me a confused look and I, once again, gave him the same speech about leaving because I felt I wasn’t getting compensated fairly. Matt looked hurt, but to his credit gave me a handshake and told me best of luck. As I was leaving the building I heard Wade yell dammit across the warehouse. I high tailed it out of there and jumped into the safety of my car. I checked my phone and it read 1:41, in a span of 10 minutes I quit three times. 

The feelings I felt inside that old, beat up BMW, is something I will never forget. I felt happy it was over, happy I never had to go back to that place, happy I stood up for myself. But the only words that repeated in my head, were “That sucked. That sucked.” Those 10 minutes were some of the most emotionally draining minutes of my whole life. All in all folks if there is anything I learned from that experience is to know your worth, trust your gut when entering a new workplace, and never divulge more than you have to.

93,Apollothethird,1613913309,"Jesse got up from his old, wooden rocking chair with a groan. He needed a new hip, but the waiting list was long for those that hadn't broken their previous hip. He lived in an bungalow next to a church. It was old, run down and some would describe it to be rustic. It looked like a different world had merged with the Christian world, as the small bungalow could very well have been a cabin in the woods. 

The wind howled outside. Jesse poured himself a cup of coffee and shuffled back to his chair on his front porch, in which he had a view of the neighbouring graveyard. The wind continued to howl and the rain poured as if it was a cup of coffee itself. He had a particular view of a grave he liked to watch from his rocking chair. 

Jesse was 73, and had lived a long and full life. He had met Louise when he was 16 and had asked her out every day for 6 months before he finally wore her down and she agreed to go out with him for dinner at JJ's. JJ's was this sweet old diner on the corner of his hometown. Jesse had taken Louise there for their first date, and five years later he had proposed to her there too. They were young to be married at 21, but Jesse had been in love with her from the first time he had set his eyes on her and he knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. Their marriage had lasted all of 6 months when Louise had left.

When he was 64, he had stumbled into Louise in, you guessed it, JJ's diner. She had aged like a fine wine. They caught up, and Jesse found out that Louise had had 4 kids and then been divorced. She had been an alcoholic from the ages 36 to 45 and she had had to check into rehab twice. She had sobered up, but she had missed most of her children's childhoods. Her ex-husband had found himself a new wife, and she had wandered the roads for years in regret. Then she had stumbled into Jesse again, and so they fell in love. Jesse had had an ordinary life, he had gotten a job and made a living, but never took another long-term partner and was childless. 

8 years of bliss with Louise passed, and then he found out she had cancer. She fought like hell, but some battles aren't meant to be won. He had buried her last Autumn. He had had years of happiness taken from him only to get a glimpse of what he could have had and then he had it taken from him. The funeral was a somber occasion, and was the last time he had seen any of Louise's kids or grandchildren. They never cared to visit. He had buried his brother 6 years ago, and Jesse was the last living member of his family. His bloodline would die with him.

He looked at Louise's grave and smiled, remembering their fairytale lovestory through the rose tinted glasses gifted to him by grief and time. He had little to do, but sit and watch. Watch as families came and went, children cry and adults stand with grimaces on their faces and men stand with no sign of emotion for fear that they would seem weak to cry at their father's passing.

He watched and imagined how these people had a life he never had. He supped from his black coffee and enjoyed its bitter taste. It was company for him. The church bell rang. No priest had ever come to see him since he bought this little cabin and he had had no visitors in the winter. He had Christmas presents that would be delivered by the executor of his will at this stage. 

 *************************************************

A child at his grandmother's grave looked over at the cabin and saw an old man sitting alone on his porch like he did every Saturday that he visited. He wondered what he did. He had asked mam who that man was and she had said he was nobody, but that wasn't true because everyone was somebody. The man looked sad. He looked like he could use a hug. So the child waved at the strange man on the porch every Saturday when he came to visit Grandma Louise's grave. Mam wouldn't let him talk to him so the wave was as best as he could do. How many waves add up to a hug?

**************************************************

Jesse waved at little Tommy every time he visited Louise's grave. Tommy had no idea who he was, of course, as the boy's mother was too busy to even spare more than five minutes for her own mother's grave on a Saturday and definitely had no time for old rickety men who were your mother's partner for the last 8 years of her life. Jesse would make sure Tommy would not have to stay with his mother if he didn't want to, when he turned 18.

Jesse went to bed at 9 and woke at 8 every day for 6 years after that. He barely had any visitors, ever, but seeing little Tommy grow up was nice for Jesse. It made sticking around worthwhile. The pandemic came and went and Jesse saw very little difference in his frequency of visitors. One day, he went to sleep at 9 and never woke up. He had felt at peace. In his will, he left a note to Tommy. It read 

""Spend an afternoon at your grandmother's grave for me. I've lived a long life, and it becomes nearly unbearable to live it on your own. Take my cabin, and make some coffee, and slow down for me and for Louise.

I’m what some call a “Gun Fanatic” or according to my mother’s words, a kid who needs better and safer hobbies. I can’t blame her for thinking that though, as my Mother she takes it upon herself to look out for my best interest. Although I am 21 years of age and fully capable of making my own decisions and learning from them, I do appreciate her care. I mostly appreciate the feeling of safety and protection she shares with me. 

Recently my life has been slowly getting better, but I can’t seem to escape the feeling that I’m being controlled. Not outwardly, but I feel as if something is telling me what to do, and that some of my actions were never something I ever thought of. No, maybe I feel that I can’t be in control of anything, that I have lost control. I don’t know. I pass them off on the daily as “Manic” episodes or I blame it on lack of sleep. 

I had a dream one night that made me feel just how useless it would be for me to feel safe at any moment, and that relying on anything to help me would put me six feet under just as quick. 

I had been walking through my old High school, not sure what I was doing there, possibly to visit my little brother and bring him his lunch he continuously forgets at home. It’s no bother to me, I love seeing the little guy. As I’m walking through the halls, I hear strange noises, but they are familiar. I began thinking, what could that be? I pay no mind to it. The noises get louder as I walk down the hall when the realization hits me: Someone’s loading a gun. I freeze where I am, unsure of what to do because I see this stuff all over the news. An active shooter? I am unarmed and unable to help with anything? It could be a cop? But why would he be loading his weapon right here right now? Just then 3 kids walk into the hallway from what seemed to be the bathroom and sure enough: All 3 of them were armed. One of them takes aim right at me and my knee jerk reaction was to jump with all my strength into the nearest classroom by me. As I jumped in I had SCREAMED for everyone to run to the back exit in the classroom, and that I saw 3 students with weapons. Everyone in the class just looked at me blankly. Are you guys serious? RUN! Please! Save yourselves! We’re the thoughts I had. No one had taken me seriously and even I for a split second wondered if I was the one going crazy. Soon enough the all too familiar boom of an AR went off in the hallway and that’s when everyone began running. Students were jumping through windows to escape, cramming and trampling other students in the process, but it was too late. The three had entered the room and opened fire. I jumped into a locker of some sort that had conveniently been right next to me (sometimes dreams help out a little bit) and I laid the flattest I could and waited for the booming to stop. At one point bullets were flying through the little locker I was in and I knew then that I was going to die. The noises stopped. I laid there in anguish hoping they wouldn’t even find me but one of them opens the locker. He looked down at me then just walked off. I couldn’t even move. As hard as I tried, I was in shock. Did that really just happen? What could I do? I crawled out of the locker and looked around. A truly horrifying sight to see. Dead. Everywhere. 
The guilt was unbearable. I wanted to cry but I couldn’t. My despair turned to annoyance, then anger when the next thought passed through my mind:

Did he smile at me?

The booming continued down the hall, and purpose filled my body, I HAVE to stop these monsters. I quietly sneak down the hall hoping to catch them before they had a chance to go upstairs. Surely all of the students up there were either hiding or have already safely left the school so I had nothing to fear aside from protecting those students left. I notice an on duty officer for the school was killed by those... Monsters, and picked up his pistol, and racked a bullet into the chamber to make sure there were going to be no mistakes. I find them in the next hallway surely just about to lay waste to another classroom, the thought of it scared me just as much as it did really piss me off. Knowing I can incapacitate all 3 of them with one shot each rather quickly due to my practice at the shooting range, I take aim. I take a split second to breathe in, then finally pull the trigger.

Click. Click. Click. 
Nothing.
No noise.
No boom of salvation for those students or even myself.
Just 3 sad, impossibly sorry, clicks.

Once again I was in shock, without knowing what to do I was once again frozen, 
and useless. As always.

Two of those scum kicked in the door and the booming commenced again. The screams from this dream stayed with me as if they were real, just as the booming does. The one however, walked up to me, smiling as I stand frozen in fear.

What can I even do?

Boom.

I wake up, unsure of what the hell is going on in my head. I am relieved that it’s just a dream. It still bothers me though. It felt a little too real.",stories,False Protection,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/low0x7/false_protection/,1613881304.0
95,mahTABI2019,1613908821,"When corona first started hitting numbers here in my city, I heard ab a student diagnosed with covid in our college, fastforward, I emailed the the dean saying “I have been in close proximity to the person who got diagnosed with covid for most of the day and now, a week later, im coming down with the symptoms like runny nose, fever and dry coughs. Is it ok if I don’t show up in the classes for two weeks and self-quaratine myself?” I was lying to get a free two-week break to get prepared for the upcoming end-semester exams.

&amp;#x200B;

They approved my request. The next morning I had been having my pivotal life moment and was overjoyed until my phone rang. I pick it up, it’s the freshmen representative on the other end of the phone, he asks me to pack my stuff up for a 5-day hospital stay and ambulance will pick me up at 1 pm. I was like “but I’d like to stay at my place isn’t it better?”.  “if u resist, police will be involved and im sure you do not want to be forced to do it against your will. just go along with it. It’s for your own sake and especially other people, do you follow what I’m saying?” he replied. So might as well I had to get into the ambulance, stg I frightened the living soulout of my poor neighbors as they were staring at me stepping into the truck.

&amp;#x200B;

In the hospital, first off, two doctors questioned the places I’ve been to in the last week, the people i’ve met, where I met that student and when did the symptoms start appearing. Eventually after completing the questionnaire, they sent me to an isolated room with all the doors locked with only a small window facing the neighboring concrete wall. I had been communicating with the nurses through snapchat lol. Moreover, two PCR-test had to be taken and if the results come out negative, they’d let me go.

&amp;#x200B;

Four days passed by and don’t even get me started on how disgusting the hospital-foods taste, on the first day she brought me two food packagings one of which was soup that i don’t like at all, opening up the other one’s lid I could see cooked rice mixed with chopped beef and boiled potatoes, I was like uhm ok it’s better than nothing, I grabbed a spoon of rice meat and potato, when I bit down to it oh god...guess what?...it wasn’t potato!!! That was a piece of fucking pineapple \*smfh\* I hardly contained myself not to bust the door down, and grab a handful of pineapple to force-feed the lunatic working in the kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

long story short, I took the PCR-test two times, then on the fifth day as I was ready to check out, the nurse came in with that spacesuit-looking isolation-gown, saying “could you pls sit down I’m going to collect some nasal samples for pcr test” I was like “wait a minute, I’ve done this two times alrdy, didn’t they come out negative?(i broke out in a cold sweat)”. “don’t panic, your second sample has got lost and we’re truly sry ab it. now we have to repeat it once more” she said  :/// I was completely baffled by it, told her to get it over with, I just wanna go home.

&amp;#x200B;

The absolute dreadful foods on one hand, having a cotton swab shoved all the way up your nose, elbow-deep that u can feel it touching the back of your head, not only once BUT THREE TIMES on the other fucking hand.

I don’t know what I’m getting from writing in this thing, but off I go…

My name is Than, Than Nimrod, I’m 17, I live in Texas and the date is February 11th, 1944.

If I had to describe something outstanding about myself, it would have to be my albino skin condition. It's something I inherited from my dad...or so I am told. You see, I never caught a glimpse of the bastard, so I ain’t too sure.

Anyways, that isn’t why I’m here.

About a week ago my sister, who I loved very much, was found dead at the bottom of a cliff some miles west from her house. The police ruled it as an accident, and so did I. That is, until last night at around 8:00 PM.

Depressed from all the shit I’ve been dealing with for the past week and a half, I decided to take out my frustration by downing a half-liter bottle of tequila (I know, not my brightest moment).

Safe to say, I was not in the best state of mind.

I don’t remember much of what happened later on. However, one thing I do recall, is going out for a walk right after taking the first set of gulps, and eventually my drunken mind led me to a dark, old musty alleyway. Then, a gap in my memory, followed by a sharp nasty pain on the left side of my abdomen.

I instantly sobered up.

My vision was blurry, but I was able to make out the unmistakable shape of a knife wedged inside of my belly. I fell to my knees, and then to my stomach, the result of which plunged the knife deeper into my intestinal bodies.

It was a mess...a disgustingly graphic mess of blood and gore splattered across the concrete floor.

As I lay on the ground, coughing up red, I remember watching as a cloaked figure, who I assume to be the perpetrator, fled the scene leaving me to die.

And I did...I died...at least it felt like so. 

I woke up the next day feeling completely fine, not a scar or bruise on my body, so I assumed I just drank too much alcohol...till I saw the same exact knife laying right next to me.

That's when I realized I was still in the alleyway.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

I called the police, and decided to drive all the way to the hospital just in case. Though, after conducting a series of tests on me, it was determined that I had no injuries and, according to the doctor, I was “the healthiest alcoholic he’d ever damn did see.”

What a fucking joke.

The cops didn’t believe me for shit when I told them my side of the story, and probably thought I was some loony spouting off nonsense. I even showed them the knife, and they still called bullshit. But I’m not crazy! I know what I saw! I know what I felt!

I spent hours just reminiscing over the whole ordeal. Scratching my head furiously like I’d never done before. Thinking to myself, “Fuck, fuck, fuck, am I really loosing my shit?” or something to that effect.

It wasn’t until much later, that an idea popped into my head.

I walked to the kitchen, and snatched a box of matches along with a bottle of sleeping pills from the pantry, taking both with me to the living room.

Now, it's at this moment that I should mention that I live with a roommate - his name is Kevin - we don’t get along very well, so I decided that since I was gonna go out, I would do it as a final “fuck you”.

I lit a match, set the curtains aflame and swallowed the whole bottle.

...

What I saw next...will haunt me for a good, long while. 

It was pitch black and I couldn’t breathe...I couldn’t fucking breathe...Do you know what that feels like? No? Not fucking good.

After what seemed like a few minutes of staring into an endless void, a faint white light began to fill the atmosphere, making it somewhat easier to see.

I didn’t catch sight of anything at first.

Till I turned to face - what I assume - was my right shoulder...There stood two strangers, looking directly into my eyes.

The one closest to me bore a purple suit, and watched with a stern, almost imposing demeanor. Despite that, he had a certain air of familiarity to him. I don't know how else to describe it.

The other one...the other one’s the one that really freaked me out. 

He was...me, there's no other way to put it. He had my white hair and skin, along with my mandarin colored irises. I could’ve brushed him off as my own reflection. However, unlike the larger man, my reflection had a look of...horror to his face. He wore an expression of pure fucking agony...agony I never hope to catch a whiff of for as long as I liv-

...

“Hey! You’re gonna be okay! Just don’t move!”

Those are the words I remember waking up to.

Having been witness to something so unnerving, I couldn’t help but stare in shock at the paramedics as they pushed my carrier onto the back of an ambulance.

Alright so a few things have happened since my last entry.

Firstly, I came out fine from the whole fire ordeal, and I’m not gonna lie, I felt awful. Man, I was convinced I’d gone mental and was fully prepared to die last night, but sadly that wasn’t the case.

What’s strange is what happened afterwards.

Apparently I was found passed out in some dark corner on the other side of the city? I’m truly at a loss for words.

A couple was walking by, spotted me and tried to help, but ended up just calling an ambulance to come pick me up.

That's gonna put a dent in my savings.

Onto other matters...I’ve been experiencing some horrendous fucking headaches, many of which have caused me to loose my appetite for eating, drinking, or even sleeping. (Its two in the morning for fuck’s sake!)

As for the apartment...erm...I didn’t want to get sued for destruction of property, so I feigned ignorance and got away with it. Of course, some still suspect it was me, but don’t know how to counter my ‘being several miles away at the time of the incident’ argument.

Regarding my roommate...

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, I don’t like Kevin. I loathe the guy on account of him being an open racist that enjoys mocking me for my condition, though I’d probably feel guilty for trapping him in a fire, so I made sure to “commit suicide” while he wasn’t home. Fortunately, He and I were allowed to stay in another apartment from the same complex for the time being, and while It isn’t much, at least I’ve learnt to NOT cook myself alive when conducting future experiments! Hooray!

Whew...I think I need to catch a breather...My sister is dead, my family (besides my uncle) doesn’t give a flying fuck about me, and now this. I just want to lay down and take a nap, but I can't. My bed’s a pile of ashes.

Anyways I’d like to make this update longer, but I don’t really see much of a need to keep this up so I’m cutting this one short. I guess this is goodbye for n-

Warning: this story involves the portrayal of suicidal thoughts

\*\*\*\*

Feeling a sting in the corner of his eye, he wiped off the beads of sweat by his temple. Levi underestimated how long it took to take down this piece of shit aluminum window frame. His knuckles were all red and sore from gripping onto his screwdriver so hard. That did not matter for it would cease very soon.

Levi stepped onto a foldable chair with his other foot on the windowsill, which grooves that kept the sliding glass panels in place dug deep into his sole. It was awfully tranquil here. The night breeze was cool to the face. The streets were dead without sound. The windows were mostly dim, asleep like their owners, and there were tens and tens of those between the one Levi was in and rock hard concrete. The moon was hidden beneath the mauve clouds, tainted by all the light pollution in the City, eroding into the countless pillars of concrete that surrounded him. All Levi could hear was his own heartbeat, oddly slow and steady. This was it. One jump to end it all. He would do it. He would fucking do it. A quick clean painless death he always wanted.

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. This was the easy way out than rotting until who knows when. Levi had nothing. He lost it all. No friends, no family, no nothing. Back when the Integration was announced to be brought forward, he was all for it. What better could happen to him than falling back into the embrace of the Ancestral Homeland? Surely the City would be bound to prosper even more under the direct leadership from the Capital. While Levi sat at home in front of his television, listening to official speeches on plans to make the City greater, nearly half of the City’s inhabitants were on the streets to show their discontent with these change of plans that they had no say at all. Switching to the news, Levi shook his head as he recognized a fair few he once called friends being blinded with pepper spray and bashed with batons in the occiput. *That was what you get for breaking the law*, he thought, *these cockroaches deserve extermination. If you don’t like it, just leave the city!*

Right after the City’s police force was reorganized as a branch of the People’s Police from the province up north, Levi was soon visited by a few serious guests at his home. Sitting around the laid-out foldable table, one of the investigators produced six photographs from his coat. Six portraits that Levi recognized immediately. Six people who suffered from head trauma after being pinned down by armed police during an unlawful assembly that promoted secession, sedition, subversion against the State. In other words: six traitors.

“Mr. Leung Leiwai, from what we have investigated, we conclude that these six culprits have suspiciously close ties with you. In accordance with Article 67 of the National Security Law, to safeguard the stability of the City and of the Country, we were granted the authority to freeze your all assets and place you under house arrest.” Another investigator produced a few pieces of paper stapled together that had a ubiquitous red circular stamp with a star in the middle.

“Wai- Wait. But I did not do anything!” Levi nearly lost his words as his heart sank. “I’ve been supporting the Party throughout these years! You can’t do this to-”

“I understand your emotions, Mr. Leung.” The inspector’s monotonous voice interrupted his shaky words. “The Provincial People’s Police has thoroughly investigated your background in the last decade and we have come to the conclusion that this is the correct choice of action. Until you earn another 5000 social credit points, these actions will remain imposed on you. Good day to you, sir.”

An hour passed after his guests left and Levi still found himself staring at the documents on the foldable table before his wife came back fetching their daughter from school. Realizing the implications of being associated with an Undesirable, it was not long when Levi found the side of his bed and his daughter’s room empty. Only a note by the nightstand. No explanations, like the stapled stack of paper with the red stamp.

Levi was alone. Those who were not behind bars were miles and miles away from the City seeking asylum. There was no one left for him. Well, maybe the hamster his daughter left behind counted. It was his only connection he had left of his own flesh and blood. Wait. Who would take care of it if he jumped? He left so many people down, he could not let them down even more. But what difference would it make? It was just a stupid hamster. But what if for some miraculous reason he managed to not become an Undesirable and he was allowed to see his daughter again? Yeah, what a joke. Like that would ever happen.

There was a buzz. A familiar one, from the foldable table. It was his phone. Of all the  times, someone just had to make a phone call now. His foot was sore from standing on the windowsill. Levi winced at the pain and let his foot down back onto the foldable chair. The grooves had eaten into his sole and it was white from them. Limping slightly on his left foot, Levi squinted to make sense of what the bright screen was showing. It was a face he so missed, he could recognize in a split second even though his vision was blurry from welled-up tears.

“Hi dad.” A soft chirpy voice emanated from the speaker.

“Winnie?” Levi’s throat was stiff. Not another sound left his lips as he struggled not to show anything that might give away his emotional state. “Don’t call too often. They’ll know.”

“Yeah, but...” The voice continued, “I don’t really like that new man mom’s with now. I really miss Hong Kong.”

“It’s getting colder in Shanghai, Winnie.” Levi let a sniff escape his nose. “ Make sure you eat enough and wear more clothes okay? Daddy is fine here. Don’t worry about me too much.”

“Okay dad, I love you.” She replied. “I can hear mom coming back, I’ll call you next time.”

The screen went black and the apartment was silent. Levi did not budge from his spot and finally broke down after holding back his tears. His lungs were desperate to gasp for air for him to weep. His hands were quick to wipe off the streams of tears on his cheeks as soon as they formed. He pushed the piece of shit aluminium frame back to where it belonged and screwed it tight in place.

Today was not that day. And Levi vowed that day would never come.

99,le_sursiks,1613899536,"I've started to feel comfortable with the perfect world I've created in my head. The external world - the real world - is no longer of interest to me. It's a place where I am so desperately miserable; I think we all are and will always be. It had been raining all week long. It is now clear skies with sunlight beaming. I decided to go for a walk. 

I walk out the door aimlessly along the street where the wildflowers grow. I had walked for a long time and staggered to a bench near a church. I sat for a moment staring at my tired feet, watching the heat shimmer over the asphalt. I had spaced out but became alert when I felt a sharp pain coming from my foot. My eyes followed the silhouette of the pumps that sat on my old running shoes. Before I could exclaim, my eyes met with the sweetest face I have ever seen. I was captivated by her sultry looks. She had done damage to my foot. It caused enough pain to make a man want to cry like the little piggy she had stepped on that cried wee wee wee all the way home. But her beauty surmounted the pain. 

'I'm terribly sorry. I thought the bench was empty.' 

Her voice was just as sweet as her face. My mouth said that's alright, but if my feet could talk, they would be screaming bloody murder. 

She sat next to me, adjusting her sunglasses from the top of her head to her face. I looked at her and said, 'gorgeous day, isn't it?' She was looking straight ahead and replied, 'it sure feels like it.'

'Oh no, it definitely looks a lot better than how it feels. It rained so much I thought I'd never see blue skies again. And by golly, look at the greenery, it's, uh, never been greener.'

She chuckled. 'I never see blue skies, or rain, or how green the greenery is. I'm blind.'

I apologized as I redden with embarrassment.

'No need to apologize,' she said. 'Instead, would you please tell me more about how gorgeous the day is?'

I looked around and was stunned to see that what I had said as mere pleasantry was actually true - it was a gorgeous day. 

I began. 'The chirps you hear are of goldfinches that like to nestle in the magnificent birch tree that is across from where we sit. I can almost see it bending and swaying from the harmonious sound of the birds. There is a tiny mountain of soil next to you. We are bound to see a mole poke his pointy little face and say hello to us. Oh and the wildflowers -- ' 

'Hello, darling.' A handsome man interrupted. 

'Tom? Tom, is that you?' Delighted by the sound of his voice, she jumped up and embraced him. 'Let's go, darling. The day is far too beautiful for it to be spent out here all by your lonesome.' He took her arm and walked away with her. I became the bench she thought empty.

Clothes wildly thrown all over the room etc..... Well   we're probably like 10-15 minutes into the session and there's a knock on the door. We were plenty content to just ignore it so we did. Knock gets louder and we hear some talking outside. I yelled ""wrong room asshat"" or something like that. Minute or 2 goes by and all of a sudden BOOM BOOM BOOM... the door splinters open but the chain keeps it from opening all the way. BM scampers off into the bathroom in terror and locks the door behind her. So now I'm on the bed still rocking a hard on making eye contact with some middle eastern looking guy whose looking in the crack and me and demanding that I open the door. I'm furious so I told him to fuck off and he starts asking to see ""the girl""/""where's the girl"". I'm like, she's in the bathroom and she's not leaving there until after I fuck you up and she knows it's safe to come out (none of our stuff including our clothes was in the bathroom yet.... so she's in there as naked as I was except for a few hand towels and a nasty shower curtain. The dude at the door starts threatening to call the cops and keeps on kicking the door but failing to pop the chain and I'm still standing there with my dick and balls becoming slightly less excited but still good and ""useable"" telling him to go ahead and call them. So eventually the door does pop open and im standing there in all my glory ready to square off with Habeeb. He starts shouting ""where's the girl?! I need to see the girl!!"" and I'm telling him that she's MY girl and we ain't into sharing. A few more awkward minutes pass as the stand off continued when the ACTUAL fucking cops show up and draw their pistols on me standing there in our hotel room still clubbed and as naked as can be. I start swearing to them that I'm unarmed with my hands up and flopping about when BM finally cracks the door open to peek out. She sees the cops standing there and opens the bathroom door wearing the nasty shower curtain draped around her and then Habeeb says ""DAMMIT!!! Wrong girl."" So now we're both good and confused as the intruders start backing out of the room except for 1 of the cops who throws me my pants and tells me to start getting dressed after letting me grab BMs clothes and give them to her so she can get dressed in the bathroom. After a minute or 2, the cop asks us to sit down and explained that some other teenage hotel guest had gone missing and that they heard us fucking and thought I'd nabbed her. They took statements from us and Habeeb, who was actually the hotel manager, gave us a new room on the house. It was an awkward check out the next morning.",stories,So...

101,boomboomboom97,1613894681,"Once in school, our physics teacher while he was teaching us gravity, threw up the duster to demonstrate gravity but instead the duster went in a rotating fan just above him. The duster crashed near my friends head, he was just saved from a hammer like blow as the fan was on full speed. 
A week later a new trend had started, the entire class was throwing things in the rotating fans, this included duster, bottle (empty and filled), bags, tiffin. It got so wild that students from other classes came to our class just to throw things in the fan. Soon the entire grade followed us. 
But once it got out of hand as one of us threw a mechanical rounder in the fan and it hit a boy with its pointed side in his thigh. Also a fan had become loose and had slowed its rotation. Soon the teachers knew about it, it was chaos. 
That same day, the physics teacher came to know about this and he came to warn us about to not do such deeds again. There was a guilt and a smile on his face that said,""You boys made me proud and infamous at the same time.""
Yet we never stopped this continued till the last day of the school.

This was a only boys school. So no one was caught particularly.

[translated from Spanish]
My Mom and Dad made it out of Venezuela.  My dad had worked for an oil refinery in Caracas and he paid off an oil shipping vessel employee to let us be stowaways on the vessel.

We made it to the port of Cuba then to Miami.  My dad was able to obtain working papers from a deceased individual and he got a job in the Research Pavilion at Disney Epcot Center.

My childhood was really great because I was able to go to Disney every weekend for free.  My dad over the years would tell me how he learned how Disney has sustainable fish and plant farms that both feed off of each other and that there’s a whole other section that’s not open to the public that he allowed to see because of his cleaning duties.  

Ever since I was a little girl all I’ve wanted to do was be a Disney performer.  One might say I’m an underachiever but I’ve always gotten straight A’s and I just loved the Magic of Disney.

My dad was also very intelligent and at times he was a little bitter because no matter how hard he worked he knew he would just be a member of the cleaning crew at Epcot.  He didn’t want to put to much added attention onto himself because we were all in the country illegally.  My earliest memories were when I was three years old being smuggled in that oil vessel for hundreds of miles at sea.

My dad would tell me things about the park that he picked up on that very view people realized. For example you could look for hours at any of the Disney’s Parks water ponds that are located throughout each one of the theme parks and you will never see a fish, but if you take a step off the property then the smallest pond will have millions of them.  My dad would tell me that Disney would allow only certain things to grow where it wants them to grow.  He told me one time how he was a hundred percent positive that only one lion was brought in from the Animal Kingdom to Epcot for research but two weeks later two adult lions were transported back out to the Animal Kingdom.  He told me that everyone thought he was just a dumb Spaniard so the Research Team wouldn’t go out of there way to hide things from him.

He did everything possible to try to persuade me from being a Disney performer.  He told me he was certain that when he first got the Epcot position in 1995 some of the performers at the Magic Kingdom never aged.  He would explain to me that every weekend we would go to the Magic Kingdom and since I was so into dancing he would actually pay close attention to the “performers” in the parades  throughout the day.  Then my dad said that he would see those same “performers” go to the Research Center at Epcot the following Monday for an “inservice” but the only thing is that he still see’s some of the same “performers” who still go to the Research Center at Epcot for an “inservice” and they haven’t aged one day.  My dad always told me not to tell anyone of the Disney secrets he told me for fear of my own safety.  He did say that occasionally Disney would hire one or two performers off the streets but that was rare and was only done just so nobody would catch onto their own science experiment of “performers.”

My dad had his theories of what those “performers” could be but he didn’t know for sure.  However, he did know that Disney saved millions of dollars in salaries because the “performers” didn’t need to be paid.  My dad told me that he was fairly certain that the “performers” were being housed in the various fake houses throughout the parks.  He would show me for example that there’s houses on the Magic Kingdom’s Main Street that really serve no purpose and that the “performers” would actually be plugged in after their parade performances.  He told me that he was asked to clean one those houses while a parade was occurring and he noticed a bunch of sleeping pods where each pod had an extension cord to plug something in.

Regardless of what my father told me, I had put in 1000’s of hours worth of dance practice and countless dance competitions just to be a Disney performer so I was going to get a chance at an audition one way or another.  

I didn’t want to do anything to jeopardize my father’s employment so I didn’t mention anywhere on the application that I was the daughter of a Disney employee.  The one advantage I did have was that all of the “performers” Disney employed were Caucasian and I’m Latino so it seemed like nowadays Disney was making an effort to diversify its workforce.

About two weeks later I was called in for an audition.  I did everything that was asked of me and they liked me so I was called in for a second audition two days later.  Once again I did everything they asked me to do and I felt that all of their dance steps were easy to remember, so I was called in for a third audition four days later.  I was really confident and I always had a good stage presence so I knew I did everything I possibly could to get the position.

A week later I received a denial letter in the mail with no explanation of why I wasn’t selected to be a performer.  When I read that letter I felt like my whole life had been flushed down the toilet.  I got so filled with anger that I drove down to the rehearsal studio complex and demanded to speak to the hiring manager, Mr. Baumgardner.  I’m only five feet and four inches tall but I stormed into that office like a linebacker who was going to tackle the quarterback.  The hiring manager was a man in his  50’s who was a little taller than me and seemed like the very non confrontational type.  I demanded that he tell me who he hired over me.  He kept telling me “Don’t worry Ms. Sanchez apply for the position again next year and who knows you might get it. You were really close.” 

No matter what I said he wouldn’t tell me who he hired so I said “Mr. Baumgardner I asked you 30 times who if anyone you hired as a Disney Performer and you haven’t answered me, so I’m going to go on the Disney blog page and tell everyone about your army of “performers” who aren’t even real people.”

He looked at me like I had figured out where he had buried millions of dollars with of treasure after I said that.  He said “Excuse me for a minute.  I have to make a phone call.”  Then he left the room and I could tell that he picked up the phone right away and then closed the door to the adjacent room.

Mr. Baumgardner came back about five minutes later and said “Listen Ms. Sanchez, I could tell by your passion that you really want to be a Disney performer so I talked to my bosses and they were willing to give you a chance. Come to Epcot tomorrow and we’ll get you fitted for one of our outfits.”

I almost broke down in tears when I heard that and I said “Thank You so much Mr. Baumgardner.  You won’t regret this decision!”

When I got home I couldn’t believe that I had actually made my life’s dream come true.  I didn’t want to tell my parents until after I was fitted with my outfit and I knew for sure that Mr. Baumgardner wasn’t just trying to get me out of his office.

......................

My name is Ramon Sanchez and I haven’t seen my daughter, Grace Sanchez in three weeks.  This is the first time I am reading her diary and I wasn’t aware that she had auditioned to be a Disney Performer.  I will go to the Magic Kingdom now and see if she is performing.  

I arrived at the Magic Kingdom and positioned myself along the Main Street.  I can hear the music for the parade start.  In between, the parade floats for Cinderella and Rapunzel, I was amazed when I saw my daughter’s smiling face living her life’s dream by actually being a Disney performer.  No matter how many times I yelled “Grace Grace” to try to get her attention, she didn’t break her character.  I was just so proud of her.  

I followed the parade to its end around where the park’s entrance is located.  Then I used my Disney Employee ID to sneak back to be with the performers.  When I saw my daughter backstage, it was one of the proudest moments I had ever experienced and I wish I had brought my wife to watch Grace as well.  I knew then that sneaking out of Venezuela and working as a cleaning person my whole adult life was worth it for my daughter’s sake.

But my joy turned to being a concerned father pretty quickly when Grace showed no emotions and was apathetic towards me.  I kept saying “Grace it’s me daddy” and she looked right through me like I didn’t exist.  Then one of managers clapped their hands and all of the “performers” followed the manager including my daughter.

I see my daughter everyday when she goes to Epcot for her “inservices.”  My wife and I know that this is something that our daughter always wanted so we watch her in the parades as well.  My wife and I have accepted that if we would intervene and take Grace away from Disney then Grace may hate us for the rest of her life.  Grace probably has no concept of who she is or where she is but she always wanted to be a Disney “Performer.”",stories,Don’t let your daughter be a Disney Performer,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/los4gf/dont_let_your_daughter_be_a_disney_performer/,1613865121.0
103,knitwizard93,1613886266,"About 10 years ago me and my boyfriend at the time were leaving his dad’s house in a small town in Indiana headed to his mom’s house in a slightly smaller town also in Indiana. The towns are a few miles apart and the quickest way to get there is via county roads, about a 15 minute drive with farmland on either side. There’s nothing on either side of us except in summer when the corn grows. Pitch black out. No street lights. It was late at night, around 11pm. I am driving. We are the only ones on this road. I start to see something ahead in the road so I slow down. I come up to the object and it is an old fashioned baby bassinet. It was standing about hip height. It’s all white with a curtain, standing upright completely normal looking just a little left of the center line and slightly crooked. I couldn’t make out what it was until I was already right there and as soon as it registered I lost it. I panicked and floored it, frantically looking around, and I think I even said something like we have to go, now!
  A few years ago my dad had sent me one of those chain emails that warned not to stop or get out of the car if you see a car seat on the side of the road because it might be a trap to lure unsuspecting women and rape, rob, or harm them. I kept that in the back of my head and in that moment when I drove up to the bassinet it flooded back to my memory. 
  By then we were just down the street from his mom’s. I was still so spooked. We called the police but we actually cross county lines to make this trip so no one would claim jurisdiction over it. We called both county’s police stations and got nowhere. This story still chills me. 
  Also I remember my then boyfriend telling me there is a small trench bridge right off the road right about where we were. That would be a perfect hiding spot.",stories,Almost baited,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/loq6tx/almost_baited/,1613857466.0
104,AnomalyCroissant,1613886148,"Tonight as I was sitting on the porch of my apartment (which is on the second floor), I had yet again seen a stray cat casually walking on the sidewalk. Although this time it was a different cat than the one I would usually see. See I had been saying a previous stray cat in my complex for some time before this one, so I had thought this was that same cat. But this one was light grey and had more white, as well as more fur, while the previous one was black and only had white on its paws. As soon as I had seen it I said “[Gasp] it’s the cat!” as I had at first glance thought it was the same cat from before and was surprised to see it still alive and well after that bad ice storm from this past week here in Texas. But I had quickly noticed that it was a different cat. Anyways, as I had said that the cat immediately stopped and looked up at me curious as to what made that sound. I froze too because I realized that it had noticed me, and I was just like “(o.o) it heard me”. It then casually sat down.. and just stared at me from below. Surprised I had quietly said “Aw, hi cat haha”. I was just surprised that it had just sat down to stare at me, as the other one usually wouldn’t notice me and/or would quickly glance and then just walk away. I guess it was just so cute that it had stayed with me instead of walking off. I also didn’t know what to do lol. I mean it sat there so casually and looked so intrigued by me. So I had started to get up just so I could stand, and the cat had risen its ears a little bit, intrigued or surprised from that (but still sitting). But before anything, a car had came up and scared it off. As the car was coming though, it looked back at the car, back at me, back at the car, and then speed walked off underneath the cars.

I shrugged it off as a accidental photo I took but then realized the date it was taken on was the day I was sick so it was impossible for me to have taken that picture my phone was not at school either I am using a Samsung s20 and it has a type of format for photos example if a photo were to be taken today the title would be : 20210220_(random numbers here) and I am the only one with a Samsung phone in the class thus meaning this photo had to be taken on my phone but the problem is that I wasn't at school and the weirdest part in the photo there is only 2 people (I have a class of 28 people) even if let's say someone in my class did have a Samsung phone it wouldn't make any sense for it to send it to me.,stories,Mysterious photo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/loote9/mysterious_photo/,1613852400.0

107,Texas_Son-1836,1613878400,"I don't want this to sound like I'm proud of what happened or that I'm bragging about it, this is just the story as to why I never finished school because as of lately it's been on my mind. I want to stop feeling like I do over it, so I'm sharing it here. Read it if you want to.

When I was about 16-17 I quit high school because of the drama that was going around. You see the previous year (Freshmen) one of the girls in my grade started picking at me saying I smelled bad, in all actuality I smelled like Dial and Right Guard. After the summer passed and we were Sophomores I figured maybe she did some growing up, I figured wrong she would say the same thing every week and then I would get sent to the nurses office and have to go home and change cloths then come back to school. Well fast forward a few months and her mom had died from cancer. That only made her more of a b*tch towards me and my group of friends (the emo, the pothead and the guy that nerded over anime) so at some point after Christmas break I had enough and thought about something I could do to make her stop since the teachers wouldn't intervene.

The day it happens. I come in late, take my seat and after 5 minutes, there she goes ""it smells like dookie in here"" then she turned to her group and started giggling then one of the guys said something about my mother going to prison. I stood up, turned around, looked her dead in the eyes and said ""Atleast my mother is still breathing"" and sat back down. She burst into tears and I got sent outside. The teacher came out in the hall a bit later and said go to the office. In the office I had to wait for the principal to get off the phone and when he came out and saw me, he sent me back to class without a second thought. I did have quite a record in the office, so I guess he knew he wasn't gonna get through to me.

Later that day when I got back from lunch the half autistic football player decided he wanted to pick at me too. Now I should state I have an autistic cousin so I know how that can effect someone but this guy took it too far. I told him ""If you really wanna fight, then swing at me""...he accepted the offer. He threw a jab at my eye and I turned my head a bit causing he fist to nail my ear, then without hesitation (my arms were folded) used the bottom of my fist to catch him under the chin. He opened up his defense at that point so I drove him into the ground then started wailing on him nose, eye, lip didn't matter all busted up. The principal came outside and pulled both of us into the office. When he got done with his lunch, called us in and had a discussion...no surprise I ended up getting the shit end of the stick because I won the fight he started. I was sentenced 2 weeks of In School Suspension (ISS)

Well I should mention that I was always the quite kid, I listened to multiple conversations and knew a lot of secrets. When I returned to normal scholl from ISS I decided in my teenage rage to release those secrets all over the school. Long story short best friends started hating each other, a teacher got fired, and parents were taken kids out of that school. I found out that it put a big target on my back and the Principal and the Superintendent both made the rest of the year hell on me for giving there school a ""bad name"". At the end of my Sophomore year I applied for an online school and they never sent me a login, I emailed them and they didn't respond. That's why (on paper) I'm stupid.

109,Theloinsofmyink,1613870487,"Last June I sat here, over the valley and open fields, writhing in regret and the cold summer sun. There was not a time I had felt more alone, not a day when I had cried the most, nor a moment of such relief, until you came.

Like the snow on a Spring morning, your shadow entered my blurred eyes. There you stood with the sun at your back, the rays of light shooting forth, beyond the horizon, as if Gabriel himself lent his hand from the heavens. 

“Mind if I sit?” You asked with a gentle smile, and softer voice. I nodded and, as you promised, the sights became brighter in the conversations we shared. We spoke of the world, and its injustice, we spoke of dreams, and their tragedy. And as the day wore on, with the sky yawning into an autumn red, you stood again.

“I’ve gotta go now, thanks for everything, see you next time” 

Next time, you said. Was it God’s cruel trick? Goading me to keep wishing for a happy life? 

“Yea, see you next time...” I promised you. 

And the promise I kept, I awaited there, on a Winter morning, holding my coat close, and my scarf tight. And in the dull grey of the promised snow, I would wait, and there I did. So, the sun came to its zenith, a watching eye over all, soon tiring to a blue day, into darkness.

Then, like the snow on a warm winter, you came from the darkness, as warm and brightly as the summer long passed, with a smile gentle, and a voice softer.

“Here,” You gave me a box, wrapped in reds and greens, topped with an cerulean ribbon, as blue and warm as the Azure Sea. “I’m sorry about today,” Your eyes... “Thing’s have changed in my life, I may not be able to see you for a while” The tears brimmed on the whites of your eyes, smiling sadly. 

“Then here I’ll wait,” I said. “Until all is good in the world,” You smiled, reaching for me, wrapping your arms around my body whole. Life rarely felt so promising. And just as you arrived, you left in the darkness, leaving me there again, with a promise on your lips, and a warmth in my heart. 

“Until next time,” I spoke to the darkness.

“I’ll be waiting,” The darkness spoke back.

Today is June, and here I am again, as I was in May, and April, since the start of Spring, and the end of winter, waiting. And the sun shines more today than ever before, a wonderful gold shrouds the valleys and open fields. Smiling and basking in the warmth of the season. There had never been a time more hopeful, never a day brighter, never day so patient. Just as I was, patiently waiting, watching the day pass with the dandelions on its breath. The sun rose white at dawn, then gold at noon, then a rippling red opposite to the moon, where the stars neared their hour of shine, and there I waited patiently, for you. Then came the darkness, rolling slowly onto the sleepy world, awaiting the sun rise, as did I. One might have given up by noon, or the show of the red rippling sky.

But you promised, and so did I. So, here, I’ll wait.",stories,"So, here, I’ll wait",https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lolqet/so_here_ill_wait/,1613841687.0

111,Emradinn,1613862195," 

His very first memory was of himself crying in a closet, his parents screaming their hearts out at each other in the entrance hallway. Their words didn’t make much sense to him at the time, but he still remembered the feeling of being afraid, alone and terrified at the incomprehensible anger they were putting on display. He was three then. The memory came to a grand finale with his father smacking the door shut, not to be seen much of again, and his mother curled up in the corner of the sofa, still yelling, crying… and pointing at him all the while.

His consequent early childhood memories were somewhat of a blur. There had been a lot of moving, as his mother had decided to shed her past life to look for better pastures. Then somewhere along his adolescent years began the memories of what would be a long streak of stepfathers, accompanied by violence, abuse and drugs. Here and there were sprinkles of joy, and genuine childhood memories he cared for, but for the most part, the only thing his childhood left inside him, were bitter feelings of anger and hatred… Lots of hatred. 

At the age of sixteen he ran away and began living off the streets. His parents hadn’t given him much, but from their behaviour and broken promises alone, he’d developed a keen nose for bullshit. That alone kept him alive long enough to realize, that no one in the world looks out for anyone else but themselves. Altruism always came with ulterior motives. 

Now, he was eighteen, staring down the barrel of a gun and sweating profusely. On the other side of the gun, stood *Kansas*. Kansas was what some would call, a connoisseur. To Caleb, he was a dealer, and in this particular case, he was a very pissed off dealer. Caleb, despite his silver tongue and quick wit, had *not* gotten away with “*the heist of the century”,*  and was now about to pay dearly for trying to steal weed worth more than a decent house in the suburbs would cost. A house with double parking…

and a toolshed…

Tools included...

“Did you *really…* Think that you’d get away with this Cale-head?” Kansas pressed the gun against Caleb’s forehead and gave it a solid push.

Caleb flailed with his hands for a rough second, before he landed on his ass with a thud that echoed somewhat flatly between the containers surrounding them. 

“Did you *really?!* Think that you could rob ME!?” Kansas pointed the gun at his own chest, then back towards Caleb. “Have you *any* idea… How many years I’ve spent building this Empire, and how many squirms like yourself I’ve had to deal with?” Kansas smacked his tongue in frustration, and before Caleb could react, the gun went off. 

He’d been stabbed in the arm once. He’d also gotten beatings since first grade, and taken on more than enough tough love from his many step-parents, but nothing, could compare to the sheer pain of being shot in the stomach. He yelled… Or at least he thought he did. The world was in shambles, and nothing felt real, not even his own voice. 

“Listen, kid.” Caleb was indeed yelling, really, really loud. “Hey!? Are you listening!!” Kansas took two quick steps forward, and kicked Caleb where he’d shot him. “I’m fucking talking to you!” 

The pain made Caleb black out for a second, but before he could get any reel relief from passing out, the pain brought him back to reality just as quickly, and this time with a vengeance. Having no prior experience with this level of agony, his body started convulsing making him vomit violently. He was too shocked to be shocked about seeing that most of his vomit, was probably blood that was supposed to be inside him.

“Look kid, I’m sorry. You know, sometimes I gotta make examples of thieves.” He aimed the gun at Caleb’s head. 

“No…” Caleb felt his entire body scream with pain, as he mustered every ounce of life he had left to put his hand in front of his face. His voice cracked, and he felt tears beginning to take form in the corner of his eyes. “Please.. No..” His hand fell back down, as his body felt suddenly powerless, and cold. 

“There are always consequences kid.” Kansas sighed, and pulled the trigger. 

Caleb had thought about death many times. He was born in a time when raw greed had destroyed most of earth, and humanity was teeming on a cliff heading towards catastrophic decline. People were still bothered about the color of skin, of who was and wasn’t worthy of love, and not least who was allowed to love who. Suicide had become a gnawing thought at the back of his head that made him strangely okay with the encroaching cold that was slowly eating away at the corners of his consciousness. The last gunshot he knew was aimed at his head and the fact that he was still thinking, meant that either the remnant pink jelly in his head was struggling to keep a sense of self intact, or the bullet missed, and he had died, or was about to be, considering blood in vomit not being the best of signs last time he checked.

He allowed the cold to creep further in, and in the process he felt it transform into something akin to that warm embrace his mother gave him, back when he was three, after she was done crying and yelling. He could feel his tears drip down his cheek. They were warm, and left cold streaks that stung as a breeze caught his face. He knew, deep inside, that she loved him… At least she did, back then when he didn’t have a personality she had to relate to. 

“*What a weird thing to think about*” Caleb thought to himself. And as the seconds went by, and his consciousness kept fixating on trying to figure out why it was still conscious, Caleb himself realized that he was still, in fact, very much conscious. And still in pain. He opened his eyes carefully, just a little, but enough to make his reflexes involuntarily kick in, forcing his eyes to very dumbly gander at his surroundings, which, to his surprise, were nothing like the docks of death and gloom where he'd been shot, only seconds before. 

In fact Caleb was pretty sure, that for some reason, he wasn't even on Earth anymore.

People who missed the call would phone me back. Which meant getting 10 calls a day from all over the country. Now on my side, I was thinking it was the “We’ve been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty” people, but no. I found out it was scammers, because one texted me. Then I answered a phone call and the guy thought he knew me. He kept saying my voice was familiar and I told him I live on the opposite side of the country. Another girl kept saying “GIRL! IT’S ME, JULI!” And I don’t know a Juli. Then she sent me her snapchat and still wouldn’t believe me when I sent her that I didn’t have her as a friend. Was I being pranked? 

Which leads to the next phase of why I’m going crazy. I had a baby 2 months ago and wasn’t very close with my husbands family until I got pregnant. Recently, his grandmother wanted to call me and sent me her number. I texted the number a picture of my son and it called me.

Her: Who’s this? 

Me: uhhh, is this DH’s grandma, Sue?

Her: this is Lisa! Who is this? 

Me *not being able to hear and talking louder*: IS THIS SUE? 

Her: no, this is Lisa! I work for project 8 housing. I call this number when it calls me. Are you looking for housing? 

Me: oh, uhhhh, no. Sorry. 

Her: oh, really? I thought the picture of the baby was a cry for help. 

The second I hung up the phone I called my husband about how bizarre it was. After telling the story I burst out laughing. His grandmothers number was one number off from her area’s project 8 housing number. 

Safe to say I’m going down the rabbit hole on these weird coincidences.

**Phone calls**

– *This is a story about a man named Frank* – That's how it all started. My gaze was fixed. – *Frank considered himself a nihilist, even though he had never read a single related book or article. Frank was an inferior man. His routine consisted of discussions with his religious neighbor, visiting his girlf…* – I crushed that object using my hand, my telephone, and ran out of my house. I almost stepped on the untied shoelace of my tennis. I ran so fast that the rug in front of the door stuck to my foot and followed it to a stop on the small staircase, which held it.

My neighbor was in pure anger, banging his cane on my wall. – FRANK, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THERE? DANCING?! – I wanted to send that old son of a bitch to fuck himself.

– My house… my sanctuary… did anyone put cameras there?… – In my head it made perfect sense, my mustache man poster cosplaying Superman is the only proof of my disbelief.

When I left the house, I supported my leg on the balcony and tied my sneakers. The distance between the balcony and the door of my other neighbor was practically nil, if she opens that door with force I will be thrown down the building. I have to be careful not to step on her flowers again. This woman can only have to be crazy, okay I was drunk and I accidentally took a piss on the flowers and killed some, but they are FLOWERS.

He was lost in thought as he finished tying his other shoes. I felt the sock bothering my foot, my wrinkled blue T-shirt and jeans, which, at least, were perfect, but I tightened my belt too much. My glasses were dirty, but what bothered them most were the thousands of scratches. I finished tying my tennis and started walking again, went down a nearby ladder and turned right. I just wanted to leave the house, it was no longer safe there.

– Dell, I need to call him! – I pulled out my cell phone and instantly called, it was fixed on my contact list. Dell worked as a clown for DGN Inc. or shit like that, before it was a policeman involved with concealment of evidence, he would have been arrested had it not been for his uncle. But seriously, working as a clown? He must keep this makeup on all the time, he must have got so fucking fat.

– Hello? – His voice was hoarse, much more than before. –

– D-Dell? Look, I know it's too early to be calling you, but I have a fuckin problem – The cell phone detaches me from the reality that I was walking down the street looking at everything, but not looking at anything. I can see the circus spotlights from afar, coming and going. – What was it this time, Frank? Don't tell me your neighbor threw you out of your apartment again… – With an angry expression I looked at the phone, as if it were Dell's face.

– NO DUDE… it’s something different. Someone is watching me, but like, watching me on another fucked up level. -

– Dude, who would want to stalk you, huh? Your ex? -–

– Dell, I already told you not to talk about her. –

– Okay, my bad. Yo, it’s almost closing here, why don’t you come here and drink some tea? You’re nervous, I understand. –

– Okay, I’ll run then. –

– Alright. - I hung up and ran to the DGN. –

I ran out towards the circus, my tennis wanted to untie again.

– CRAP! Fuck it, I’ll change you other time! –

I approached the entrance, panting, and saw a rusty trailer parked next to this “main attraction” of the circus. There was a fat man sitting right at the entrance to the trailer, smoking a cigarette and watching the security guards.

– D-Dell? – The fat man turned and looked at me, showing a yellow smile and throwing his cigarette away.

– Frank! Good to see you, it’s been a while, right?… like two months. –

– It seems much more, you have changed so much. Is this clown job that good? You’re fucking fat. Dell laughed at that, and reached for a cigarette.

– Do you want to get fat too? It’s easy when you just have to attract parents and children to enter, I don’t even need to make them laugh. - I stopped to analyze Dell again, he still had his makeup, white powder all over his face and with blue diamonds on his cheeks. It looked like a portrait of a sad clown, but who can keep up with a lot of food and cigarettes, but at the cost of beauty and teeth.

– It didn’t work, I'm too old for that. – This time I was laughing, my joke didn’t change Dell’s expression, even though I thought she was much better than talking about his weight.

– Well, do you want to come in? Let's talk about your stalker… or your stalker, hehehe. – He laughed mischievously, his yellow teeth highlighted that naughty face, as if he had discovered a fetish of mine.

– Don't look like that, I'm fucking scared. This person even knows how my room looks like, bro, I have a poster of a mustachioed Superman, it's the only nihilistic thing in my life, and guess what? That person knew it. – Dell didn't take that smile off his face, even with my touching story.

– Nihilist, is it? Damn philosophy, I never understood that shit. Get in here, man. – He entered the trailer and left the door open, it was small and quite rusty. With a spare tire on the floor, used as an accent, Dell put his foot there and tried to make a manly position while holding a cigarette that was not yet lit.

– Want some coffee? I rarely take it, it will expire in 1 month, and I haven't used even half of this package. – He used the steppe as a ladder to open a cabinet, inside there was literally a packet of coffee, a half-sugar bag and some cookies.

– So that's what the spare tire is for? And me thinking that you wanted a rustic style… or untidy. – He pretended not to listen and threw a plastic cup at me. – You're my guest, but that doesn't mean you can call my fucking room untidy – I apologized and approached a jar of sugar, put two spoons and took the package, shook a little and left the glass full of coffee. – You're not trying to poison me, are you? - That malicious smile is back. - Maybe, check the validity there, I'll need some glasses. –

I looked and went still. – It really is 1 month to expire… if we were 2 arses in the past. – Dell was a little pissed, he took the coffee package from my hand and threw it out the window. – Crap, the fat from those snacks must be going up in my head. – I cleaned the plastic cup with water and placed it upside down, near the sink.

– Bro, have you drink expired coffee? - I was worried about him, maybe that's why he looked so different.

– I don't like coffee, but the security people come here sometimes to smoke one and talk, so I served them a coffee… and they were sick, I thought it was that shit I gave and I didn't have time to clean . –

– Holy shit Dell, how are you so lucky? And me thinking that you had been beaten by the security guards and you were like that, ugly and fat. –

– That I know a beating doesn't make you fat. –

– Maybe they punched you so much that part of your body went to the belly, like, what if your cock is inside your belly now? You became gay bro. –

– My cock inside my own belly? Okay, okay… it must be inside my belly. -–

– I knew, and don't even try to do something, my punch is fast like a pistol. It will get your dick out of your belly in an instant. –

We laughed a lot. He closed his hand and used his thumb, pointing to the same window that threw the coffee away. – Right over the window there’s some mushrooms growing, the climate is a little humid in that place, and I tested it in a cup of tea… my brother, I think I was reborn. – The feeling he was passing was different, as if he were serious.

– You know what happened the last time we used mushrooms, right? I was feeling like a giant, I thought I could go through a fence and crush it like a toothpick, but it hit right on my balls, I think I became sterile after that. -–

– Hahahaha, don't remind me about this, I'm trying to look serious. But hey, get out of the trailer and take a look at the mushrooms, see if you like the color. – I waved and got out of the trailer, went around for him, stopping near the window. It was already a little dark, so I pulled out my cell phone, which had five percent battery power, and turned on the flashlight quickly. I saw a bunch of red mushrooms. – Damn, bright colors like that represent poison, and just that color… – I picked one just to test it.

– Hey, Frank. – Dell appeared through the window, holding the same cigarette as before, which was already disappearing between his fingers. - Next, these mushrooms are edible, just give them a roast and send them to your belly, so don't worry about the tea. But what I wanted to tell you, why not take a look at the main attraction, huh? While holding the mushroom in my right hand I said. – Are you sure? And those security guards there? – He threw the cigarette away. – Don't worry, I talked to them just now, they will let you in. – My eyes shone, I looked towards the entrance and I walked. – Thanks, Dell! I hope it’s really breathtaking. – I didn't see his face, he put his head back in the trailer, I just imagine him lighting another cigarette now.

Suddenly I hear footsteps, something running, coming towards me. I looked back and saw a security guard, closing his fist and trying to punch me in the face, I managed to avoid but he took my back. – FUCK, CALM DOWN, DELL LET ME IN!!!! – The security guard ignored it and kept coming at me, I tried to fight back, but boom, I took a punch from another security guard, right in the face. That shook my head completely and I fell to the floor. My eyes were still open, I managed to see Dell coming out of his trailer, drinking something that looked like coffee or tea, and looking in my direction, with that fucking yellow smile and sawed-off look.

All of the residents of the pig farm had gathered around a large concrete podium-styled elevation at the entrance to the farm. When the humans still controlled the farm, the elevation served as a ramp way for trucks who’d come to pick up the pigs for slaughter. However, after the swine residents took over the farm and overthrew their human oppressors, they have started using the elevation as a sort of stage for speeches and assemblies. 

The farm’s elected-for-life leaders conducted these. The third leader of the pig farm was an elder boar with a massive scar running down the side of his face. Even in his old age, he seemed like an intimidating beast. Pedro I. Goodwin, a name given to him by his former human oppressors.

Pedro stepped up the concrete elevation with the utmost confidence. He expected to be blasted with complaints from the other residents of the farm. The farm had experienced a period of stagnation and decline.

A deadly plague of dysentery afflicted the young ones. The disease killed indiscriminately, forcing the young piglets to defecate themselves to death as they slowly wasted away in front of their helpless mothers. Death was slow and painful, sometimes taking weeks at a time. Predators were another danger. Wild cats were unstoppable killing machines that could devour a newborn piglet in a matter of hours, leaving nothing, not even the bones. The drugs the humans left when they were chased out of the farm did not cure swine diseases. They merely served as mild symptom management. An epidemic of mental health ravaged the elder residents, who remember the days during which the humans abused and tortured them for their meat and reproductive abilities.

A litany of problems riddled the pig farm, and Pedro had promised to fix them all during the elections after the death of the previous farm leader, Harold Oswald Grando. Thus far, however, Pedro seemed to fix nothing, merely enjoying his newfound status as the prime breeder and head of the Pork Society. Pedro’s position as the leader of the farm meant he had full control of the resources within the borders of the farm. He had access to the best food and the best chambers, leaving the other residents to suffer in the feces and mud-covered parts of the farm.

Pedro stood on the concrete elevation, a gigantic cloaked object was rolled behind him as he greeted the squealing and shrieking masses.

""Friends, brothers, sisters… We’ve gathered here today to deal with our problems. We have come here to eradicate our ills. We are here to solve everything! I promise you that today we’ll start our path to a better futu…""

He was cut off by a shrieking female pig, ""Enough talking, Goodwin!""

The crowd jeered, ""Yeah! Enough talking… Start working, you pig!""

The scarred boar shook his head and tried calming the agitated masses down, “Now, now… I promise you, today everything changes!”

""Oh yeah? What will you do about this?"" another Swine called out angrily, hoisting the bloodied skull and spine of a piglet that ended up as a meal for the cats. The crowds gasped in unison at the gruesome sight. 

Pedro stood there, silent, his eyes transfixed on the crimson bones of the piglet that didn’t even get to live long enough to know the scent of its mother.

Another pig yelled out, ""What will you do about this?"" pointing to the exposed blood-red muscle on his thigh. “The floors in the western tower are still slippery. I cut up my leg. Someone else might die!”

""Some have already died like that…"" another one barked in response.

A young boar called out with a strained voice, ""I am sick and tired of cleaning out the jammed corn dispensers! When will you get the water out of food?"" He snored in sheer contempt.

""We already started butchering our young to spare them from the clutches of the plague!"" another pig cried out, sending a terrified sigh through the crowd.

""What will you do to fix this?""

""What will you do?""

The crowd roared in unison, ""What will you do?""

""What will you do, Goodwin?""

""What will you do? Huaaaaugh""

Pedro I. Goodwin stood there, completely silent, letting the crowd rage on until they seemed like they were about to lose it and overrun the concrete elevation. Then he motioned with one of his hooves. One of his bodyguards walked up to the cloaked colossus behind the farm leader and removed the cloak.

The crowd went silent at the sight before them, Goodwin soaked in the collective awe of his subjects as a wide smile formed slowly on his massive head. The scar on his mug bent, giving him an ominous look. He motioned his hoof again, and another bodyguard handed him a short bone spear.

Goodwin turned to the bloated, pale green corpse of Harold Oswald Grando. The remains of the previous leader were riddled with puncture wounds, and blood pooled down to its hind legs and behind, causing the lower part of the carrion to turn purple. Goodwin jammed the spear into the abdomen of his predecessor.

""This is the source of all our ills! We must punish him for those mistakes he had made, for they have cost us gravely!"" The pig kept on stabbing the carcass until its guts fell out and covered the farm-head in blood.

Under the force of Goodwin’s blows, the bone spear cracked and broke in half, leaving the sharp tip lodged deep inside the side of Grando’s body.

""We must correct what he had broken. The roofs to combat the cats? A ruse to cover up his classicism! They don’t even protect us from the feline devils!"" Goodwin roared as he started beating on the decaying remains of his predecessor with his hooves.

The crowd started cheering the senseless violence.

“We must break those roofs and dismantle the corn dispensers. The corn must be hand-dispersed equally among all of you, all of us! We must import better medicines!”

The crowd erupted into cheers and joyous squealing as the elderly hog tortured the lifeless body of a long-dead swine.

""Goodwin!"" the swine squealed.

The scarred hog suddenly stopped, causing the crowd to stop along with them. He pulled the loose skin on the open gaping gut wound of the battered carcass and sarcastically cried out, “Maybe we should make his hide into rugs to cover the floors of the western tower?”

The crowd erupted into mocking laughter as the elderly pig started pounding at the corpse all over again

""Goodwin!""

""Goodwin!""

""Today is the day we dismantle the tyrannical systems devised by this good-for-nothing human of a pig! Today is the day you people get what is rightfully yours – all of this belongs to you, all of us."" Goodwin declared as he landed a savage hook onto the tusk of his predecessor, breaking it in half.

""Goodwin! Goodwin! Goodwin!"" The crowd cried out in adulation as Pedro I. Goodwin made his way down from the concrete elevation.

He smirked, looking at one of his advisors, ""Told you, it works every single time with these simple-minded swine.""",stories,The Pig Farm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lodjlb/the_pig_farm/,1613817580.0
119,MiddleDirection2415,1613835330,"ok so i think the guy is gone at the moment,he has stopped watching from what i can see but it just feels eerie,it was barely visible and i did the 4 right turns to check if i was being followed but i think there was a handle sticking out of his pocket so yeah this is no longer fun and i barely managed to get out of view before i made it back to my house.

anyway let me pick up from where i left off,so i got a weird feeling from this guy around a week ago so i started poking around and scoping out his place,like i said it was like he was an idle zombie during the day and like a skinwalker at night,speaking of which i really hope they are just a myth because they scare the shit out of me.

so like i said,he had started making weird noises during the night that actually sound like he or someone is being murdered really painfully and slowly like tearing them limb from limb with a blood curdling screech to follow with it and because of this i try and see what is happening at his place and all i can hear in between screams is just the blunt thudding of his skull colliding with his skull thudding against a wall, but tonight was a bit different, he was mid scream and i was observing like usual, i try to stay well hidden just incase but this didnt help at all,he looked right at me,directly into my soul and made his way through his house and out of his door,i then made a b line to the road and acted all nonchalant in hopes that he was going the other way but he was not

he made a right out of his door on his way to me and i was just checking (like i said)to see if he was following me, he was slowly gettig closer and closer once he got about 10-15 meters away i took a detour into a road that goes to a little place wear my house is,though he dosent know exactly where i lived he followed me into this area and i went straight into my house and locked my door,all my lights are off, all my blinds closed and all sound muted.

If you have been to Disney World during Covid you would see how they have cut back on some of their quality control measures.  No place was more  evident than waiting for the shuttle busses to take guests from the park’s to their resort’s or to a different park.  Disney has the same pre-Covid bus  numbering system in place like if you want to the Polynesian Resort from the Animal Kingdom then go to the number 12 bus stop, but the difference with Covid is there are no Disney employees managing the madness at the bus stops.

Each of the four parks has about 60 different bus stops where a guest waits for their assigned shuttle bus.  On my recent trip, I was amazed on the mass chaos that occurred at the various bus stops.  There were 100 people waiting at one one bus to come and the stop right next to them had only two people waiting.  I know in the past a Disney quality control person stationed at the bus stop would have made a call right away to rectify the situation.

Another difference I noted was there were buses there that I don’t believe were part of Disney’s contracted bus service and those buses were making stops where there was no resort’s or park’s listed.  So when I exited the Animal Kingdom, Disney had a display board showing which bus stop to wait at if you were going to say the Polynesian resort, which would be 12 then at the bus stop there would be a sign on the number 12 bus stop labeled the Polynesian Resort.  So when I saw these faux non Disney busses stop at these unmarked bus stops my curiosity was peeked.  

I’ve been to Disney so many times that there efficiency and their attention to detail could make things boring at times.  My wife and my daughter were headed back to our resort for an afternoon break when I decided to veer off and get on one of these buses.  I figured at the very worse I could post a story on Facebook on how horrible Disney has gotten during Covid if something untoward happened on the faux bus.

The faux bus was a bit isolated from the others.  I had to walks about 50 yards to get there.  I believe it was at one of the stops for a resort that was  temporary closed related to Covid.  I got over to the faux bus and it opened its doors.  I could tell the faux bus was an older one from the mid century.  I’ve always heard that buses could last forever and this was a prime example.  The driver had to be well into his 80’s and based on how tanned his skin was, I would think he lived in Miami or somewhere where he sunbathed all of the time.

He greeted me with a short friendly “come on in sir!”

I figured why not and I got on board. As I got on I noticed there were five other weathered beaten elderly people scattered  on the bus.  None of them looked up at me and they were all in there own worlds.

I sat next to the driver and he told me his name was Hachi and that  we were going on a special tour today.  

Hachi said “Did you know that I actually met with Walt Disney and his family when he originally came here in the early 1960’s?”

I responded “Wow that must of been such a thrilling experience to meet such a great envisionary!”

As Hachi drove around the Disney owned property, he said “I’ll show you where I was when I met him.”  Hachi drove to an area that is now owned by Disney but is just vacant land.  He pointed to the vacant land and said “One afternoon me and my family who have lived in these woods for many generations were approached by the Disney’s.  They all had cigarettes in their mouthes and at first they were reluctantly kind to us.  My people had settlements in these woods that stretched from that park you just came from to the one with the castle.  My people always thought that the white man would want nothing to do with this land because it was to swampy for the white culture.  The Disney’s approached us with money in exchange for our land and my people were like what good is that money to us because we’ve hunted and fished off these lands for many generations without money.”

I said “Wow Hachi!  This is a real nice surprise.  I have seen every Disney promotional video and I had no idea that I guess you being a Seminole were still occupying this land when the Disney’s wanted to buy the land.”

Hachi responded “That is correct. I have tried many times to get our story across but we always get kicked off the property and most of us are limited with reading and writing.  So my Grandfather was considered the chief of our tribe and he told the Disney’s that we weren’t interested in his proposal, then things got really bad.  The governor of Florida knew Disney’s idea would generate millions of dollars in revenue and our plight was bad publicity so the Governor did everything possible to silence us.  Besides everything was kept a secret anyways because once it was known where Disney’s intent was to built his Parks then every business person would want to cash in and buy up all the surrounding land.”

I said to Hachi “So what did they do to remove you from the land?”

He responded “Ok if you want to know then this is where the tour will start.  The one thing I did get is these useless lifetime passes to these white people parks.  So I’ll take you to the Park they call Epcot.”

We arrived at Epcot and we all get off the bus.  I quickly picked up on that the rest of the people on the bus were  disenfranchised Seminole Indians as well.

Hachi pointed to the big spherical globe and said “Do you know my name means “the creek” in my language and where that big round thing is now was once a creek.  After my Grandfather refused to vacate the land these hardened mercenary veterans from the Second World War and the Korean War, who were hired by the Governor camped out by where that big round thing is now and absolutely terrorized my people.  Our horses became food for them and our women became nothing more than pleasure for them.”

I was in absolute horror learning these things, because I remembered trying to get the perfect picture with my daughter and that big round thing.

We took the monorail over to The Magic Kingdom and Hachi was trying to point out more positive things like where him and his cousins used to play together but then he would always end with something morbid like “me and my cousin were chased in those woods by white adults.”

We got off at the Magic Kingdom and Hachi and his followers didn’t crack a smile the whole time. They sorely stood out amongst the crowds of happy faced pale people.  They just looked like they all came from a funeral.

Hachi directed me into the park and he kind just looked around like “huh the neighborhood really had changed.”  He scoffed at the poorly constructed buildings on the Magic Kingdom’s Main Street and mocked the male singers who were singing Acapella verses where he had to prove his manhood as a young boy well before the Magic Kingdom was ever built.  

Then he took me to where the Carousel presently stood and said that “this piece of s@*t was put here for no other reason than to mock my people.  You see this is the most sacred of land where my ancestors have been buried for many generations.”

I looked at him completely shocked as he told me all of this information.  It just completely changed my whole view on everything.  It’s like learning in elementary school how George Washington was this great man than later learning that he built himself on slave labor.  

Hachi seemed to want to conclude his tour and he looked at me and said “So now you know that when you white people trample on the souls of my brethren, where you mock us and play dress up, just know that you and your family are cursed for life.”",stories,Be careful of the shuttle busses at Disney World unless your willing to learn the real truth,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lo6s2t/be_careful_of_the_shuttle_busses_at_disney_world/,1613797614.0

I digress, this story is at a bar which, I will for the sake of this post keep a different name. Lets give it the name of Town pub.

At this pub, you will first see a shed that they have built especially for smokers, a picnic bench in the center and a bucket with about a million cigarettes. If all the smokers in that shed saved the money that they would've spent on cigarettes then they would be able to put their kids through collage. But its like what I told my mom a few weeks back, poor people spend money on non essential things more than the rich do. Upon walking in you are greeted by the “regulars” the people that keep the dive bar alive, for without these handful of degenerates it would be the death of the you coming in. You sit down and are given 3 choices, a tall beer(usually only 3-4 to choose from), whiskey or vodka. That's it. Its simple and that's the good part. After getting a drink you are handed a menu, with about 6 items on it, french fries, cheese sticks(not mozzarella, its not that classy), hamburger, cheese burger, hot dog or bowl of chili. The drinks seem to do there magic, declining the offer of ordering anything you reluctantly say, “cheese burger and fries please”. You then get a few more drinks and start having side bets with the guy next to you because you feel like pressing your luck as it were(it's a Saturday and collage football is on all day). Going to the bathroom almost seems like a task, the regular has you locked into one of his many war stories when he was stationed in Iraq but finally you go. The inside is rather clean, then because of slight paranoia you look down at your watch and see that its only 4:30pm. You start to pee and observe what seems to be the remnants of coke. The rules of the dive bar are as follows, the bartender will not care if you do coke, just don't tell anyone and don't make it obvious. The booger sugar is good for business, a sad fact. Returning to your spot at the bar, the two who you were talking to cashed out but good luck for you two more go in their place. Though its hard to converse, they are fresh off the street and you have been their for a few hours. Its equivalent to playing pick up basket ball with guys that have played all day, they have “fresh legs”. With one more shot in your system, you decide that all good things must come to an end. It's halftime of the third collage football game you have watched and you are ready to head home. This particular place was walking distance form my house. What better way to cap off this degenerate afternoon than asking for a cigarette for the walk home. You take one look back and think, what an amazing afternoon, down at Town Pub. One of many for you will be back.

There are 3 nations, dreaded dynasty, the finders and the new world dynasty. The new world dynasty has manter, Roman and nomad.
The new world dynasty spread to the north islands, an area where a civilisation died 2600 years ago. The old towns and bodies left from the meteor were near unrecognisable.
The dreaded dynasty caught 50 spies coming from the north, the next day, the royal family was kidnapped. Dreaded dynasty was getting attacked by the new world dynasty, but dreaded dynasty split in 2
The dreaded dynasty is now new dreadland and dreaded people.
The finders sent 40 spies to new dreadland to kill their royal family and take down the nation, and burning the cities.
This is where new dreadland collapsed.
The finders found a new continent. They took it. Knowing that the new world dynasty would come soon and then the finders will overthrow the new world dynasty. Well, the new world dynasty didn’t go anywhere.
Nomad had a plan, he had a plan to ruin the other nations.

“Well, we need to find the other nations and get away from this meteor land.” Roman exclaimed.
The new world dynasty (TNWD) found 2 nations sharing 1 huge continent, those nations didnt know the other side of the world was alive.
Well, the 2 nations, the dwellers (TD) and new states of green (NSOG) attacked the finders, and took their land, TD and   NSOG merged to become the dwellers of green (TDOG).

129,Mrdollarjoint,1613807264,"We’ve all heard of lucid dreaming, being able to consciously influence the events in a dream.

But have you ever had a lucid nightmare? Where no matter what you did, you couldn’t wake yourself, whatever you conjured wouldn’t stop the entity chasing you. I have, and here is my story.


It was strange, I knew I wasn’t awake, I was standing in my living room. The tv was quietly buzzing the cold soda in my hand feeling half empty.

And the old man sitting in my chair was too clear not to be real.

Immediately I tested my dreamscape by setting the soda down on nothing and believing it would stay, which, surprise, surprise, it floated like it was on a table.

I heard this crinkle and looked to the old man, I then asked “this is my dream, who are you?”

The man was pulling a cigarette from a clear cellophane container not saying anything. So like most of my dreams with strangers in them, I materialized a handgun and shot at him.

Everything changed in that moment, the floating can clattered to the ground, replaced by a still beating heart. The man looked at me with hollow eye sockets, the muscles pulsing inside like they were moving the eyeball as he croaked 

“Not. Your. Dream. Night——mare”

And suddenly the scenery changed despite my efforts to keep it the same, I’d focus and rebuild from memory as it was torn away into an empty field.

He was standing now, and growing, his arms lengthened until they were stick thin and could grab me across the room.

I immediately started shooting my dream gun, but all of a sudden a fiery pain seared in my gut and I looked down.

Three bullet wounds adorned my bare stomach, the hardly a man across from me chuckling dryly.

“You. Can’t. Fight. Me”

I tried to use my lucid dreaming experience to wipe him from my mind but it did the opposite, forcing him to growl and leap at me.

I tried to wake up as those huge bony hands wrapped around my throat. But I slipped Deeper.

The things face came so clearly into focus as it got close. I could smell it’s atrocious breath, like death in a Hawaiian summer heat.

I made myself shrink to escape that awful embrace. Yet as I fell to the grass it changed, from lush green blades to a pungie pit filled with spikes.

I landed spine first on one, watching it stab through me with painful ease. I screamed and imagined it as a sonic blast that would toss everything away.

Instead it sucked the thing to me. Where it rapped a rope tightly around my neck before using it to drag me off the spike. I gagged and choked as it felt so real.

Then as a last ditch effort I thought of something, what do monsters fear? Bigger monsters.

It was like our souls swapped, I was the monster now. It felt like tacks being driven into my bones as my own body struggled and snarled at the end of its rope.

With an awful, sick pleasure. I spun the rope faster and faster in a circle until everything suddenly went black and I woke up in a small puddle of sweat, my knife unconsciously already in my hand.

I froze, staring through the darkness in my room at the only empty corner where very clearly I could see a glowing note that read

“You. Did. Not. Win.”

I blinked and it was gone, I did not go back to sleep that night.",stories,A lucid nightmare,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lo293c/a_lucid_nightmare/,1613778464.0
130,wickedfun01,1613805992,"In the before time, I would go to the gym most days after work.  On this particular day I happened to notice a man in the locker room.  He was fully clothed, it wasn’t sexual.  But I automatically took a mental picture as I passed by on my way to the sauna.  

I sat there warming up before my workout and thought  “How did he even get in here?  Like how did he fit?  He’s definitely the fattest person I’ve seen in a long time.  This guy is fucking awesome! Good for him for being here.   It’s hard enough for me and I’m in reasonable shape.  I mean he looks terrible, not in a judgy way but like clinically.  He’s going to have to deal with peoples stares or at least he’ll be self conscious that they are staring, judging, laughing.  That sucks!  I want to let him know I support him.  Know what I’m going to do?  If I see him, I’ll say something!  But what to say?  I know ‘good for you man’ (and do a head nod).  Maybe I should say ‘bro’?  Wait I can’t, it’s going to seem disrespectful or weird.   Hold on - I can’t connect with another human?  Okay, (if) I see him out there working out, I’ll give him a nod.  The downward nod of ‘We don’t know each other but we’re dudes and I acknowledge your existence’.  That’s perfect... and Hidden in that, he will see in my face that I support him and think he’s cool.  Nothing needs to be said “.
I had been complaining to myself earlier that I was too tired to exercise today.  I thought “My man is about to go do this and I’m complaining.   Now I’m inspired!  I’m about to kill this workout.  And I hope I see him out there.  I might give him a high five”!

I go workout.  I don’t see him.   I forget about it.  
An hour later I re-enter the locker room.  As I turn the corner and I see.  I don’t know what I see!  I’m frozen.  It’s like a spotlight blinding me.  It actually takes time for my brain to reconcile the image it’s taking in.  It was silent but I swear a siren was blasting.  There was a giant ass-crack and it wasn’t pretty.  It’s hairy, it’s shitty - literally.  There’s a lot happening.  It’s like there’s a bunch of leaves and straw rolled in crap and jammed in there,  now tighty whiteys are being pulled up and over everything and it’s lumpy.  
I didn’t need to see this.  What a bummer.    In an instant I spin around and head to my locker then hit the shower.   I’m rinsing away the sweat of the workout and relaxing, and I think “I worked hard today,  I’ll have go in the hot tub tomorrow “.   I go in there once a week or so as needed.  
“Wait, my guy wasn’t exercising for the past hour.  He was in the hot tub! With his shitty ass crack!!  No! My precious healing pool”.  It was already bad enough.  It’s over.  I can never go back.  I can never unsee it.  I can’t pretend anymore.  This hot tub is unsanitary.",stories,Sudden realization,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lo1yhc/sudden_realization/,1613777192.0

I met a very interesting man while working a summer job in rural Alabama. The county boasts the top crime rates of the state even without the presence of a city of any sort, and most of the area has been devastated by drugs and addiction (especially in the late decades of the 20th century). When I met Jonathan he struck me as a contagiously positive person with an incredible mental capacity for practical and conceptual thinking, and had a relationship with Jesus that any holy man could only envy. This was not your average artificially happy Jesus-freak, nor is his story solely about religion; no Jonathan had a personality like no other, and a lifetime of reasons as to where he is now. His true story as he revealed it to me goes as follows: 

Jonathan was born into a military family, and his dad was a high-ranking officer who was active throughout a few different wars. Jonathan’s grandfather contributed heavily to his own father’s flaws, which were abundant. His grandfather was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and was highly abusive towards his wife, his daughters, and Jonathan’s father. Although Jonathan’s father was not evil to the same degree as his own father, he unfortunately picked up a few things from the poor role model and unleashed them solely on Jonathan, as he was the only son. Jonathan father took tough love to a whole new level. He would regularly beat Jonathan for not complying to any sort of authoritarian figure, including an incident where he repetitively knocked Jonathan’s head on the ceiling as punishment, and a time where he yanked Jonathan’s hair so hard it ripped a portion of his scalp. This abuse along with always being “the new kid” at school because of his military family resulted in Jonathan being a bit of a target and trouble-maker; he was regularly getting into fights, mostly with bullies, and resorted to more extreme violence than his peers such as gouging a boy’s eye out, throwing a guy over a railing from the 2nd to 1st floor, and pummeling another with bricks. However, despite the trouble Jonathan often found himself in he was a very clean cut teenager and a highly competitive track athlete.

This was just the start of Jonathan’s troubles. Around the same time he turned 18 and graduated high school he joined a martial arts program that happened to be a front for a drug ring, and after one of his instructors put him onto acid he was already traveling down the rabbit hole to years of drug abuse. Before we touch all that he also got pregnant with his girlfriend around the  same time. His father characteristically chastised and kicked Jonathan out of the house as he was now a “man”. I’m not sure how long he and his girlfriend stuck out that relationship, but they kept the child and eventually the relationship came to a close when she chose to cheat on Jonathan with his overweight best friend purely in spite of him. I’m sure Jonathan at this point had blame to accept for reasons this relationship was so hostile, but he definitely had a knack for finding the loose cannons as one of his next girlfriends (alcoholic) ended up stabbing him through the abdomen with a dirty kitchen knife that resulted in an infected wound that went untreated too long and put Jonathan in a coma for several months; needless to say that relationship did not last either.  

The timeline following these events gets a little choppy as I am not really sure how these incidents transpired chronologically, but this mostly occurred in his 20s and 30s. The years between and after these crazy women were a bit of a whirlwind for him. His mental health was suffering from his toxic relationships with the people in his life, and his growing drug problem was starting to take over. Jonathan found himself in wrong places at wrong times. He once stopped at a local bar to use the vending machine outside when a drunk man started to confront him using racial slurs; Jonathan and the man traded not-so-friendly words and the man proceeded to pull a gun point-blank between Jonathan’s eyes. Jonathan reflexes saved his life as he was able to quickly grab the gun when the man pulled the trigger which allowed the bullet to only hit his finger (half of that finger was eventually lost). He then retreated to his vehicle as he was hit in the back with another bullet. He managed to get away and survive, but these interactions were commonplace for Jonathan as he showed me several stab wounds on his body from bar encounters.

His major problems came from the drugs though, and acid was the least of his worries. Jonathan’s drug use and experimentation progressed over the years to the point that he was a heavy heroin addict for 18 YEARS, and actually dealt certain drugs intermittently (mostly pills). There are two anecdotes he told me that I will never forget. The first was a story in which he was visiting some of his friends, fellow drug users, that included two people close to his age and one of those people’s fathers. Although Jonathan was an addict he had not participated in this particular situation and walked in on the 3 of them all passed out on the floor after injecting heroin with the father showing obvious signs of asphyxiation (covered in vomit, not breathing). Jonathan quickly slapped the other two awake, and said he saw the two poor souls look at the lifeless man and one instantly begin to check his pockets and clothes for any sort of drugs, money, or valuables to sell while the other lit up a joint and smoked her blues away. One of these people was the child of the man... and even his death could not phase their addiction. At some point Jonathan left Alabama for no reason other than to get away, and continue his drug life elsewhere. Along with a long string of overdoses he was able to survive, Jonathan had one incident to top them all. Jonathan was found in a New York City alley high on heroin with both of his wrists cut wide open gushing down his arms as he was holding a knife to his throat screaming bloody hell. Somehow police were able to subdue him without injuring himself further, and Jonathan can’t even remember a minute of it. He returned to Alabama and his drug use continued even after this, but it wasn’t until he was completely homeless, starving, and almost freezing to death in the woods when things began to turn around.

I never understood how he was able to survive the withdrawals after that long-term of heroin use, but he recalls his homeless stint in the woods to be his turning point. It seems like sort of an anti-climatic epiphany, but Jonathan claims he was able to find God in those when he was struggling with his health in the wilderness. He travelled to the closest police station and turned himself in as an addict just so he could be fed and have a roof over his head. Interestingly jail was the up and up for Jonathan. What is most impressive is that since his stint in those woods he has never relapsed. Jonathan soon found a job as a lawn care man for a local industrial plant which can be an extremely brutal job in the Alabama heat, and he worked 8 hours a day every day. He eventually earned enough money to rent his own apartment after sleeping in his car for a while. This is where I began to saw Jonathan for more than just a redeemed guy who used to have drug problems. 

Jonathan story begins to brighten up a bit here. He soon meets an extremely friendly woman at a local church service. At this point Jonathan has no confidence or belief in himself, and still saw himself for the person he was and not the person he was striving to be. His future wife is quick to tell him all the good she sees in him, and that she wanted to go to church with him every Sunday from that point forward. Jonathan, confused and reluctant, agreed to the proposition despite his afflictions. This turned out to be the best decision he could make. That woman turned out to be his future wife, and mother of all but one of his children. She happened to be a recovered ex-addict herself, and the powerhouse couple went on to strengthen their relationship with God and open up their own Christ-based rehabilitation centers in which they operated themselves. Jonathan told me countless times he would receive a call from a concerned family member of an addict, and he would go to random alleys or trashed trailers and houses calling their names hoping they will be willing to let him try to pull them out of where he once was. He was once the bleeding man in the alley, but has now become the bandage. 

Life still wasn’t finished with Jonathan, however. His road to redemption was never going to be that easy, right? Some time after his drug use Jonathan was diagnosed with liver cancer; you could argue he was still being let off easy after escaping 18 years of heroin with his life still. Long story short he beat it. Chewed it up, spat it out and stepped on it 100% cancer free. Life wasn’t done. Recently, Jonathan’s father committed suicide due to his PTSD he developed through years of intense service and actual time spent in a prisoner of war camp. He took his own life in his bedroom with a desert eagle; Jonathan might have had an awful relationship with his father, but this tragedy still deeply saddened him. He didn’t relapse.

When I met Jonathan I would’ve never guessed his past was as endlessly tragic as his. His abundance of positivity, work ethic, and the way he treated people on the job was second to none. Absolute class act, absolute stand up guy. Always brightened up my day when I was able to have a conversation with him. I was so impressed by hearing about this place he was once in, and seeing the final product of the person he is now. He had so many reasons to be pissed off at the world and to die playing with his tasty needles, but he instead chose to pull himself out of the hole on his own. To my knowledge he still has not relapsed, 12 years strong.

He told me when he ran the rehab center he learned that the relapse rate for heroin addicts is 100%. I know that number is misleading because there are countless cases of people beating the drug, but it makes me extremely worried for him. I hope his “relapse” happened long ago, I hope his relapse was what he decided to quit in those woods. It’s been awhile since I’ve seen Jonathan but I’ll be seeing him again this summer. And I hope he’s the exact same. If there’s anyone who can beat addiction, it is definitely this guy.",stories,Jonathan McGee: Story of a Lifetime,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lo09k4/jonathan_mcgee_story_of_a_lifetime/,1613770442.0

Interestingly jail was the up and up for Jonathan McGee: Story of a Lifetime

I met a very interesting man while working a summer job in rural Alabama. The county boasts the top crime rates of the state even without the presence of a city of any sort, and most of the area has been devastated by drugs and addiction (especially in the late decades of the 20th century). When I met Jonathan he struck me as a contagiously positive person with an incredible mental capacity for practical and conceptual thinking, and had a relationship with Jesus that any holy man could only envy. This was not your average artificially happy Jesus-freak, nor is his story solely about religion; no Jonathan had a personality like no other, and a lifetime of reasons as to where he is now. His true story as he revealed it to me goes as follows: 

Jonathan was born into a military family, and his dad was a high-ranking officer who was active throughout a few different wars. Jonathan’s grandfather contributed heavily to his own father’s flaws, which were abundant. His grandfather was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and was highly abusive towards his wife, his daughters, and Jonathan’s father. Although Jonathan’s father was not evil to the same degree as his own father, he unfortunately picked up a few things from the poor role model and unleashed them solely on Jonathan, as he was the only son. Jonathan father took tough love to a whole new level. He would regularly beat Jonathan for not complying to any sort of authoritarian figure, including an incident where he repetitively knocked Jonathan’s head on the ceiling as punishment, and a time where he yanked Jonathan’s hair so hard it ripped a portion of his scalp. This abuse along with always being “the new kid” at school because of his military family resulted in Jonathan being a bit of a target and trouble-maker; he was regularly getting into fights, mostly with bullies, and resorted to more extreme violence than his peers such as gouging a boy’s eye out, throwing a guy over a railing from the 2nd to 1st floor, and pummeling another with bricks. However, despite the trouble Jonathan often found himself in he was a very clean cut teenager and a highly competitive track athlete.

This was just the start of Jonathan’s troubles. Around the same time he turned 18 and graduated high school he joined a martial arts program that happened to be a front for a drug ring, and after one of his instructors put him onto acid he was already traveling down the rabbit hole to years of drug abuse. Before we touch all that he also got pregnant with his girlfriend around the  same time. His father characteristically chastised and kicked Jonathan out of the house as he was now a “man”. I’m not sure how long he and his girlfriend stuck out that relationship, but they kept the child and eventually the relationship came to a close when she chose to cheat on Jonathan with his overweight best friend purely in spite of him. I’m sure Jonathan at this point had blame to accept for reasons this relationship was so hostile, but he definitely had a knack for finding the loose cannons as one of his next girlfriends (alcoholic) ended up stabbing him through the abdomen with a dirty kitchen knife that resulted in an infected wound that went untreated too long and put Jonathan in a coma for several months; needless to say that relationship did not last either.  

The timeline following these events gets a little choppy as I am not really sure how these incidents transpired chronologically, but this mostly occurred in his 20s and 30s.

However, despite the trouble Jonathan often found himself in he was a very clean cut teenager and a highly competitive track athlete.

This was just the start of Jonathan’s troubles. Around the same time he turned 18 and graduated high school he joined a martial arts program that happened to be a front for a drug ring, and after one of his instructors put him onto acid he was already traveling down the rabbit hole to years of drug abuse. Before we touch all that he also got pregnant with his girlfriend around the  same time. His father characteristically chastised and kicked Jonathan out of the house as he was now a “man”. I’m not sure how long he and his girlfriend stuck out that relationship, but they kept the child and eventually the relationship came to a close when she chose to cheat on Jonathan with his overweight best friend purely in spite of him. I’m sure Jonathan at this point had blame to accept for reasons this relationship was so hostile, but he definitely had a knack for finding the loose cannons as one of his next girlfriends (alcoholic) ended up stabbing him through the abdomen with a dirty kitchen knife that resulted in an infected wound that went untreated too long and put Jonathan in a coma for several months; needless to say that relationship did not last either.  

The timeline following these events gets a little choppy as I am not really sure how these incidents transpired chronologically, but this mostly occurred in his 20s and 30s. The years between and after these crazy women were a bit of a whirlwind for him. His mental health was suffering from his toxic relationships with the people in his life, and his growing drug problem was starting to take over. Jason found himself in wrong places at wrong times. He once stopped at a local bar to use the vending machine outside when a drunk man started to confront him using racial slurs; Jonathan and the man traded not-so-friendly words and the man proceeded to pull a gun point-blank between Jonathan’s eyes. Jonathan reflexes saved his life as he was able to quickly grab the gun when the man pulled the trigger which allowed the bullet to only hit his finger (half of that finger was eventually lost). He then retreated to his vehicle as he was hit in the back with another bullet. He managed to get away and survive, but these interactions were commonplace for Jonathan as he showed me several stab wounds on his body from bar encounters.

His major problems came from the drugs though, and acid was the least of his worries. Jonathan’s drug use and experimentation progressed over the years to the point that he was a heavy heroin addict for 18 YEARS, and actually dealt certain drugs intermittently (mostly pills). There are two anecdotes he told me that I will never forget. The first was a story in which he was visiting some of his friends, fellow drug users, that included two people close to his age and one of those people’s fathers. Although Jonathan was an addict he had not participated in this particular situation and walked in on the 3 of them all passed out on the floor after injecting heroin with the father showing obvious signs of asphyxiation (covered in vomit, not breathing). Jonathan quickly slapped the other two awake, and said he saw the two poor souls look at the lifeless man and one instantly begin to check his pockets and clothes for any sort of drugs, money, or valuables to sell while the other lit up a joint and smoked her blues away. One of these people was the child of the man... and even his death could not phase their addiction. At some point Jonathan left Alabama for no reason other than to get away, and continue his drug life elsewhere. Along with a long string of overdoses he was able to survive, Jonathan had one incident to top them all. Jonathan was found in a New York City alley high on heroin with both of his wrists cut wide open gushing down his arms as he was holding a knife to his throat screaming bloody hell. Somehow police were able to subdue him without injuring himself further, and Jonathan can’t even remember a minute of it. He returned to Alabama and his drug use continued even after this, but it wasn’t until he was completely homeless, starving, and almost freezing to death in the woods when things began to turn around.

I never understood how he was able to survive the withdrawals after that long-term of heroin use, but he recalls his homeless stint in the woods to be his turning point. It seems like sort of an anti-climatic epiphany, but Jonathan claims he was able to find God in those when he was struggling with his health in the wilderness.

I usually do go on drives like this, and being a straight shot to a bar, just a turn from my house and a few miles down one straight road. I daydream for a bit, thinking about how boring my life is, and that every day is just the same, one after another. 

In the distance, the orange glowing lights of the rundown looking bar I go on Saturday nights stand. I leave go of the gas, and switch to the brake to pull in the lot. 

I walk into the building, one side having what looks like some bike riders, and in front of me stand guys that seem like they would own huge houses. I sit down for a drink, the bartender already knowing already what I want, and sitting it on the counter before me as I sit. 

“How’s your night Howard?” The man behind the counter almost yells in a booming and exited voice. He has a smirk on his face awaiting my answer. But before I have time, my phone rings in my pocket. It’s my wife. My heart skipped a beat as I knew exactly what she wanted. I forgot to pick the kid up from a friends. “I knew this isn’t why I came out.” I think to myself. I down my drink, slamming it on the counter as I turn around to walk out. 

I’m going 50 in a 35, the friends house being a few blocks from the end of the empty road. As I’m heading down between the lines, the engine of mine screaming at me, almost telling me to slow down and pull over, I hear brakes squeal, and a loud boom as I go flying out of the thick windshield.

I take a long deep breath, jolting up from the comfort of a bed. I look around. I’m in a bedroom. The posters on the wall scream 70’s, and the flip alarm clock read 8:58 AM. I started freaking out, looking at my hands and body seeing if I was injured. I came to the realization that I’m young. Younger than my present self, and in the exact room I grew up in. I hear slight mumbling outside the door. It’s my parents. My parents that passed away together in the event of a similar crash in the spring of 1978. 

I roll out of the bed shouting, “MOM! DAD!” while hearing my young voice for the first time in forever, obviously. They’re both at the sink, turning around at the same time with a blank expression on their faces. “What’s going on?” Mom asks. Mid sentence, I squeeze both of them. They stand there, thinking I just had some type of bad dream, as my tears are soaking through their shirts. 

Later on, I’m going throughout the day as though it was just a normal day. And in some instances, I felt like it was.

 “HEY BUD WE’RE GOING OUT, YOUR BROTHER IS IN CHARGE” I hear from the kitchen as I’m sitting in the living room playing with my dog at the time, shadow. I’m still not quite sure what he kind, but he was a huge all white dog that loved to jump on your lap the second you sat down. 

I start running around the house, looking at all the cool things and feeling the nostalgia with all the yellow curtains and the olive green and orange carpet that separates the dining area from the kitchen in this weird wide hallway like area, that had a single extra kitchen chair in it, and in the chair sat a doll of a cow, because my mother was obsessed with cows. As I’m running through the hall and pass the closet door that housed the brooms, coats, and shoes, I realize a paper hanging from the wall. At the top of it was a picture of a farm, with a cow on it of course, and at the bottom was blocks. In the middle of the page, was in big blocky, but fancy numbers that read, “1978.” It was April 7th. The day of my parents passing. 

I’m sorry this story is everywhere, considering I don’t remember exactly everything that happened. I tried giving as much details as I could, but a lot of the stuff I remember is just random bs. I wish I could have avoided it, like I could have avoided my own incident, but unlike both of my parents, I made it alive. I could have avoided it. At least should have done something about it to not let them go out. I’m living a semi normal life now, in a wheelchair, and just recovering from being in a coma.

The wind washes timidly and tepidly over me as I covet the cool relief it could offer me, if only it would.  Sweat beads above my brow, dripping down to my cheek as the heat bears down from the sun.  My heart beats in a steady, rapid rhythm as I take each step across the hot, dry ground.  I know I won’t make it much longer if I don’t find shelter soon.  I won’t make it.  
The day has been long and harsh, but the nights are no relief either, serving to only bring darkness instead of cool.  I trudge further, each step a herculean effort as the strength is sapped out of me by the radiant sun.  In the distance I see a vulture soaring with the current of the wind. 
Really, we’re all solar powered, but I guess I’m being overcharged, overfilled with the limitless energy from above.  When I get to the top of this hill, I’ll be able to find some water or shelter, hopefully both. My legs are heavy, and my arms are numb, the sweat stings as it careens down my reddened face.  I barely notice the pain at this point; it’s more of an afterthought, almost like a little ‘fuck you’.  My legs howl in agony, my guts reel in anguish as the last bits of water are pulled from my skin.
I look up and see the mountain in front of me.  I know it isn’t really a mountain.  The entire hill is maybe 400 feet of elevation, but after the past few days it may as well be Mt Kilimanjaro.  I fortify myself and continue to climb.  Just keep moving, left right, left right, left right…
“Fuuuuck”.  I twist my ankle and scream out.  I think I heard it crack.  My shoes are soaked, I hope there isn’t any blood.  I collapse to the ground in a violent and swift movement, catching myself with my hands on the shard and jagged rocks.  Immediately my hands let me know with that burning, raw feeling that they’re hurt too.  I face my palms toward me and see what resembles an unmade bed of skin on the heel of my palms, some red intermixed with the flesh tone.  I try to wipe the dirt out of the cuts, but it serves no purpose without water.  With my right hand I prod at my damaged ankle, feeling for anything that might be broken.  Slowly I pull my pant leg up to reveal my leg and sock, pulled up halfway to my knee.  I fold my pant leg just above my knee and begin untying my boot, which proves to be a labor of its own.  Steadily I pull the boot off after all the laces are undone and loosened, and immediately the pain subsides.  
The wind is picking up now.
My ankle is swollen and my feet are raw.  I place my soaked sock on the rock next to me, then repeat the process with my other foot.  I attempt to stand, placing my bare foot on top of my boot, but my ankle gives out before I get halfway.  Defeated, I recline against the rocks.  My clothes begin to dry nearly instantly against the heat of the rocks, the heat broiling me now from both sides.  My breaths are short and shallow, nearly matching the pounding of my heart.
If only I could get to the top then I could find shelter.  I know there has to be water on the other side of the plateau.  There has to be.  There has to be shelter and water.  I’ve been lost for what seems like weeks.  It’s only been two days in this horrid place, and only once have I found water.  A shallow and dirty pool, when it reached my lips I nearly vomited from the smell.  I drank it anyway.  It wasn’t long after that I realized how big of a mistake that was.  My stomach cramped and screamed, it felt like my liver was trying to leave my body from my back.  I wretched and heaved, trying to force the foul water out of my body.
I had a canteen of water, but finished that this morning.  There were only a few drops left, and I’m sure what I imbibed from that is leaking out my pores right now. 
I watch as the clouds float across the sky, thin wisps of clouds that don’t hint at rain or shade, floating miles above the ground.  They dance listlessly across the blue background, paying no mind to what is happening beneath.  The shadows start to lengthen as the noon sun starts its slow descent to the horizon.  I steel myself to make a second attempt at standing.  My clothes and feet are dry now, so before I stand I pull my socks and boots back on.  “One, two, three!” I yell aloud.  On three I stand without giving it a second thought, and in a quick motion turn to face the top of the hill.  Pain screams electric from my ankle, up my leg and spine and straight to the crown of my head as the weight of my body compresses my damaged joint.  “Just keep walking” I chant to myself.  A lizard scurries unworried in front of me, appearing and vanishing in the same instant.
If I don’t find water, I’m going to die.  Each step is harder than the last; each step feels like my feet are gigantic magnets pulling against the opposite end, trying to get unstuck.  Left, right, left… right.  Left.  Right.  
The sun scorches the earth in front of me, and the ground shimmers with waves of heat like snakes slithering vertically.  My forehead is nearly dry.  I feel moisture running down my right middle finger and turn my hand to look, revealing a vermillion palm in place of the familiar pink.  I don’t remember the cuts being deep enough for this much blood, but I know I can’t sustain blood loss with as little fluid as I have left in me.  I struggle with my shirt, pulling it off in a slow and jagged movement.  With my left hand I wrap it around my right to try and stop the bleeding.
The vulture is closer now, soaring high in the sky.  Not a fucking chance.  Not today, you go find food somewhere else.  Left, right.  Left, right.  I look up and am nearly defeated at what I see.  The hill is going to get steeper soon, only a few feet in front of me it takes a sharp upward angle.  If I traverse it sideways the pitch won’t be so extreme, but the path will be infinitely longer.  No.  I’m going up this hill.  
Every muscle in my body screams in protest as I continue my ascent.  I remember the poem “if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew…”  Well, they have served their turn and are long gone, I barely even have the will at this point.  Suddenly I am struck with energy.
My pace quickens and my legs start pumping, leftrightleftright.  I reach out in front of me and can nearly touch the hill.  I’m so close now, water.  Shelter.  The hill has steepened and I’m bear-crawling now, the pain from my hands and ankle are so overpowering that I don’t know which is hurting.   My hands and feet are working together, pushing as hard as they can, ignoring the pain from my body when the earth beneath my left hand gives out.  The rocks beneath my hand slide down the hill and my face and body are the first thing to hit the ground as I collapse.  
Slowly, I pull myself from the blackness.  I must have passed out when I fell.  I spit some dirt and rocks from my mouth, and start to survey the damage.  My head is facing the right, no new injuries on the right side of my body.  I blink some dirt from my eyes and turn my head to the left.  Nothing new on the left side, either.  I steady myself with my hands and do a slow pushup so I can roll over.  I lay down again against the rock and close my eyes, trying to stop my rapid breathing.  I count slowly and time my breaths with my count.  When I’ve regained control of my breath I look down and see blood leaking down my torso.  I have a few small cuts on my chest, but the majority is coming from my chin.  I survey the area.  When I fell I landed on a jagged rock, must have hit my chin first.
I look up.  I’m only fifty feet from the top.  I stand up in a sort of hunched position and begin slowly crawling up the hill, one foot at a time.  The blood spatters on the ground beneath me, leaving a breadcrumb trail for any curious animals.  With all my strength I push.  There has to be water and shelter on the other side.  I know it.
Twenty feet now, and the plane is starting to level off.  Not so steep.  I stand up and take long, strenuous strides.  The pain in my ankle has abated, my hands and chest are a dull ache and my chin is in agony, but none of it compares to the pain my stomach is giving me.  My body is begging me for water.  I see a lizard scamper across in front of me.  Maybe it was the same one from before.  It runs easily across the side of the hill face, quickly scampering from shelter to shelter.
I’m almost there.  Two more steps.  Left.  Right.  When I get to the top I collapse in joy, the pain is behind me now.  The valley beneath me is full of lush green planes and a beautiful blue, winding river, for miles and miles, stretching into the horizon and beyond.  It’s an oasis of bountiful and wonderful life.  Tears start streaming down my face, no doubt the only water I’ve got left in my body.  I start laughing as I think about the desperation I’ve been facing, laughing and crying simultaneously.  With my left index finger I prod my chin and feel the cut.  It isn’t big, maybe an inch long, but damn it sure does bleed a lot.  I lay there as the sun beats down upon me.  I open my eyes and the clouds are swirling freely in the air, gently with the current.  The vulture is still there, but he is definitely going to have to find food somewhere else today.  
I give myself some more time, maybe ten more minutes, before I stand.  I brush the sand and dirt and rocks from my body and pants, and turn.  When I look I see miles upon miles of barren desert.  I turn around and there’s more of the same. “No, no, No, NONONONO!”
I spin around wildly, looking for the oasis.  It’s not there.  There’s no food.  No shelter.  No water.  I crumble in a heap and start to sob uncontrollably, resigned.  
“No.  You keep pushing.  You’ll make it”.  I stand up and get my bearing from the sun.  The shadows are casting behind me, so I need to head toward the sunset.  I look down at the slope beneath me, which seems nowhere near as daunting as the opposite side was going up.  I lead with my left foot, and am met with loose gravel that gives out.  My foot slides out from underneath me, and before I realize what’s happening I’m falling, rolling down the jagged hill face.  I swear I can hear as each of my bones breaks on my way down to the bottom.
When I finally stop falling, I’ve reached the bottom of the hill.  I can’t move.  My breaths are short and shallow and quick.  A lizard darts by my face.  The clouds swirl above me.  My heart is charging, racing now.  The sun is making its way to the horizon.  I scan the horizon and see a huge, dark cloud with streaks of rain pouring down, and before I close my eyes the vultures land.",stories,Lizards and vultures,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnwz15/lizards_and_vultures/,1613759203.0

Today I woke up and did my usual Wednesday routine to get ready for work.  I’m never excited about my morning routine and I kind of just walk through the motions.

I’m not in the mood of listening to music so I put on classic Howard Stern on as I drive the half hour to my office.

I walk through my workplace doors and with my usual little joy I greet nobody as I make my way to my cubicle.  I turn on my laptop and notice “Tuesday” with yesterday’s date showing up. I have the newest version of Windows installed on my Laptop so there shouldn’t be an issue.  

I am sandwiched between a 50 year old male named Gary and and a 63 named Annette.  I’m a 20 something year old female who is not in a relationship and has no kids.  I work for the government in the Department of Transportation.  Some of my job duties entail me going out into the field and investigating road and bridge complaints.

So I knew today was Wednesday because I had gone out and inspected the Bear Creek bridge yesterday. Gary kind of creeps me out so I was reluctant to ask him anything and Annette had about three different personality disorders that only a government worker could possess and still hold a job.

So I reluctantly said “Hey Gar today is Wednesday, right?”

Gary who lacked any kind of humbleness replied “If yesterday was Monday then yes today would be Wednesday.”

It was obvious that Gary was trying to joke but he was serious that yesterday was Monday, but it was impossible because on Monday I came to the office and Tuesday I went out to inspect the bridge.  I was really going to put myself in the stupid zone so I doubled down and asked Annette the same question I said “Annette today is Wednesday right?”

She responded “No Stupid today is Tuesday.”

Typically in a normal work environment I would go complain or tell her not to speak to me that way but both were futile so I just sat at my desk and pondered why am I stuck on the dates being off.  It’s because I know I’m right. It would be one thing if I confused Thursday with Friday because there later in the week but it’s pretty easy to remember that I had my typical regrettable weekend then dragged my self into my cubicle on Monday and did nonsensical paperwork to prepare for the bridge inspection the next day on Tuesday.  So on Tuesday I did my same morning routine and went out to the bridge and put on my green reflective vest and pretended that I knew what I was inspecting as I usually do.

So I thought to myself what do I do today if I already worked “Tuesday” already.  There are some things in life that I’m willing to drop like Annette calling me “stupid” but I’m not working at this damn job another day than necessary.  Unfortunately,  there is no one else around for me to ask there opinion on what day of the week it is today.

So I threw myself in the lions den and I said “Hey Gar did you see me here yesterday in the office?”

Gary waited a few moments like something didn’t calculate correctly in his brain and he responded “No I don’t recall seeing you yesterday.”

So then while I remained at my cubicle I reluctantly asked Annette the same question.  I said “Annette, did you see me here in my cubicle yesterday?”

Annette responded “What kind of dumb question is that.  You handed me the paperwork on the Freeland highway.”

After hearing that response, I had chills go down my spine because I now know that one of them had seen me in the office while the other one had not.

So I asked Annette, “Do you remember what I was wearing when you saw me yesterday in the office?”

She replied “You kind of were wearing an all black dress that went down to your knees.  You looked like a slut if you ask me.”

I thought to myself that’s about as opposite from me as I can get as I’m wearing jeans and a hooded sweatshirt.  I’m wondering if that person was even me.  Sure I own a couple of black dresses that I would wear a couple of times a year but why to the office?

I replied in a non-sarcastic tone  “Oh thanks for the compliment.  Hey are you sure that woman was me?”

Annette responded “Well she looked like you and she talked like you and she was lazy like you so yeah it was you.”

I responded “Ok thanks for clarifying!”

As I sit in my cubicle I’m completely perplexed at why one of my coworkers saw me in the office yesterday and the other one didn’t while I know for sure I wasn’t in the office and I was out inspecting a bridge.  I know today is Wednesday and they both think it’s Tuesday.  I continue to ponder at my desk and wonder does this happen often and I just never pick up on it?  Everything about my life is so miserable that perhaps this is just a regular occurrence where a day mysteriously gets added or deleted.

I say “Hey Annette how many more years do you have to work  until you can retire?”

She responded “you hear this pill bottle I’m shaking.  I take these pills so I don’t have to think about that.  Everyday is just as horrible as the previous day so I just zone myself out.”

I then say “Gar how about you are you close to retiring?”

He laughed and said “When my wife made me move out, I accumulated so much credit card debt that I’ll never get out of here plus I have to pay for my  kids that haven’t wanted to see me for the past seven years.”

I think to myself dealing with the public’s constant complaints on potholes and everything else on top of being stuck in between the two most miserable people on earth, I wonder why I’m losing my grip on reality.  Then I further think and I draw a complete blank about myself.  I have no idea where I grew up or who my parents are.  Then it dawned on me, I know absolutely nothing about myself other than this job.  I mean nothing. I have no friends.  No cousins. Nothing.

I then say “Heh Annette. How long have I worked here for?”

She pauses for a minute and says “You know I don’t know if you started working here before or after me.”

I respond “Well how old do you think I am?”

She responded “Well besides yesterday you usually look like a miserable lesbian or something.  Maybe 25 or 50 or something. Do you still get your period?”

I typically don’t respond to her rude remarks so I brushed over her “period” remark, but she thought the same thing that I thought where I didn’t have a concept of my own age. I kind of was like the Mona Lisa which I’m not sure is a compliment or not.  I have no photos on my cubicle of anyone. No significant others.

Out of desperation, I say “How old do you think I am Gary?”

He responded “I kind of tuned you out when I got the sense you were revolted by me.  You’ve always been here kind of like a fungus.”

As I looked around the office all I see is outdated postings from the 1980’s that no one has gave a damn to take down.  I think about my one room efficiency apartment where I have no personal effects and not even a television.  

I get these what if thoughts that  what if I’m not not even a human? What if I’m some type of festering mold that grew out of this disgusting environment where I’m just a number and the less I complain the more my superiors ignore me?  I have zero memories of anything.  I derive pleasure from nothing.  Though even for me this place has been making me wonder about things.  I enjoy eating soggy cereal with little to no milk.  I have a hatred for the sun and I only bathe when I can tell people can smell me. I have never bled so I have never had a use for a bandaid.  

Gary chimed in on my thoughts and said “My first memories of you were that you gave weird a whole new definition.  I’m not sure if you even knew how to talk.  The DOT and especially I was happy just to have something that resembled a woman in this male dominated field.”

Rather than pursue this rabbit hole any further today, I just went with the majority rule that today was Tuesday.  I’m sure I’ll ponder the same things tomorrow anyways.",stories,Sometimes people just grow like mold,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnwdfc/sometimes_people_just_grow_like_mold/,1613757318.0

So this just happened maybe 30 minutes ago. I just got home, jerked off, and now I’m writing this. I feel so horny and happy that I finally sucked cock for the first time. But anyways, let’s get on with the story. 


I’ve been fascinated by trans women for a long time. For me it went from femdom to pegging/anal play to trans porn. For years I’ve always wanted to be topped by a beautiful transwoman. I spent hours and hours on Grindr messaging women and browsing but I rarely got any replies from real people. I’m a little chubby so maybe that was it. But today comes a long. I see this beautiful transwoman who is literally a block away. Tall, feminine, amazing fake tits, and dyed red hair. I decide to say hi and send a picture. She immediately replies, tells me I’m cute (I blushed a little haha), and asks what I’m looking for. I tell her I want to give my first blowjob. She takes a second to respond. Meanwhile I’m getting increasingly turned on at the thought of sucking her cock. I get a text back and she’s excited. She told me that a blowjob would make her night and that she would prefer to do it in my car. I quickly agree and she gives me her address. She’s literally around the corner! I gave her some time to get ready then I hopped in my car and drove a block to her place. 


I get there and let her know. Meanwhile I’m increasingly getting more and more nervous as well as insanely horny. The 5 minutes it took her to come outside felt like hours. But I eventually saw her walk out of the building. Holy shit she’s stunning. Long legs, red hair, perfect tits, totally passable. She hops in and I pull my jaw back up from hanging. After we exchanged hello’s and talked for a second she immediately took my hand and placed it on her bulge. I could tell how big it was and I got a little nervous. She noticed I was nervous and she comforted me then told me to drive to a park a few blocks away. 


Once we got there we moved to the back seat. She took off her pants and shirt revealing her slowly hardening cock and her beautiful chest. Once again, my jaw actually dropped and she took that chance to put her hand on the back of my head and guide my mouth to her cock. The moment my lips touched her head all my nervousness was gone and I just started sucking her growing cock. I was in love. I finally know what dick drunk is. I worked her shaft and head, sucked on her balls, ran my hand up and down her entire cock while I sucked. It was absolutely incredible. As much as I wanted to try sucking cock, I never knew I would love it this much. I could hear her moaning as she got harder and harder. It felt like it never stopped growing but when it did, I took her cock out of my mouth and looked at how massive it was. It must have been 7 or 8 inches and so damn thick. It completely dwarfed my 6 inch cock. I couldn’t believe that I finally was sucking a beautiful transwoman’s cock. Once again, in my disbelief she snapped me out of it by shoving her cock back in my mouth. This time she held my head down and started fucking my face. She went deeper and deeper while I fought the urge to gag. As she fucked me I started to feel pleasure building inside of me. It felt exactly like the building pleasure that comes from a prostate massage. It kept building and building while she moaned louder and louder. She groaned that she was going to cum and I felt her tense up. As she shot thick ropes of cum down my throat I actually orgasmed. I filled my boxers with cum. I shuddered and moaned as she did the same. She relaxed and took her hand off of my head but I didn’t want to stop sucking. As I licked every drop of cum off of her cock and balls, she looked down at me, giggled, and asked me if I came in my pants. I nodded and she kept laughing as I sucked on her head. She told me that was pretty damn good for my first time and that I did really well keeping my teeth out of the way. She finally pulled me off of her cock and we wiped up then moved back to the front seat. As I drove back to her apartment I asked her if she would be interested in topping me next time. She said absolutely and that if she had more time tonight she would have fucked my brains out. My cock started getting harder thinking about it. But she told me she will have to wait until next time. Fuck yes there is going to be a next time. 


I dropped her off at her place, she kissed me on my cheek, and told me she’d text me. Now here I am at home. I just jerked off and played with my ass thinking about what just happened. I honestly think I’m going to get addicted and I can’t wait until that massive cock is inside of me.",stories,First time blowing,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnw2e7/first_time_blowing/,1613756329.0
139,Blueevan,1613784154,"I woke up to druid reading my notes directly to wiz with the rest of the group casually listening. I wasn't sure if I should pretend to still be unconscious to avoid embarrassment or cut them off before they read my personal notes on them at the end.

They finished reading my take on recent events and began skimming through the blank pages. That sound of scrolling through notes made me instinctively jump up and snatch it away. Wiz screamed and druid nearly punched me in the face as her reaction, she started apologizing but it soon shifted to her apologizing for cuddling me earlier.

She has way too much emotion for my liking. Reminds me of my mom and the way she would break down at any inconvenience, It was uncomfortable then and its uncomfortable now. 

No one had many thoughts they wanted to voice on my writing. Except for bard who did say he was singing nightcore and the wagon driver totally liked his singing. I guess my sad life is enough to shush everyone's definite dislike of my description of them, everyone with a brain that is.

My arm still aches and the cold blowing wind makes the cut feel like its burning. I need to keep the bag over it or it starts bleeding again, I beg infection isn't a thing here or this would be a lame way to lose an arm.

The town is in the distance and we can see that cowardice bastard and his wagon of lies. I feel like holding a grudge today and I hope fighter feels the same.
......................................................................................................................................
I have a small hate for this group now.


Upon our arrival to this woodland town our caravan driver was mad AT US. He began ranting about how we let his coworker die and then lagged much farther behind making his shipment late.

It was a bit shocking how much more he was upset about the ladder than the former. We didn't get payed more than a few copper coins and fighter ended up apologizing for thr inconvenience. Hes like a god damn dog who doesn't know hes being abused by his master.

I want to sleep more but Im determined to get us to a church. I know for a fact in the game any town has a church you may stop by to receive healing and a buff. The group however agreed to split up sending me to go with bard and fighter while healer gets us some rooms with druid and wiz.

We walked inside the church and were berated for interrupting a praying session. We apologized but explained it was urgent as my arm was still bleeding and it was even worse when we pulled the blood soaked sack off it.

It felt like ripping duct tape off and having it rip off your hair, but it was more like it ripped off my skin. when the wound finally decided to clot even a little after hours of constant bleeding, it was around the bag connecting it to my arm. 

It ripped a huge fucking scab off when the bag was removed and I was suddenly bleeding out again. I didn't cry when I was stabbed but this caught me completely off guard and made me collapse. I cried, my arm bled, and I clutched it in fear of anyone touching it.

The fighter and bard talked with the priestess of the church and said some stuff I didn't hear. But soon I felt them pinning me down and someone sticking their hands all over my fucking arm. 

I had my eyes closed the whole time but Im assuming it was the priest since my arm was soon perfectly fine with a pretty rough looking scar. Which was kinda gross to look at. The entire time I was being healed my wound felt like it itched a shit ton and my whole arm, even my chest was burning up like a fever. Then boom, im fine and dandy.

I was in the middle of thanking her when she said ""The transaction has been sealed in blood"" what the fuck. 

Fighter explained what he and the priest were talking about while I was on the floor. The church does give healing but its only used on the members and donators of the church. We obviously didn't have the cash so the only way to get me any heals was to..... Make me a member of the church of the Forgotten God. 

This day is just getting worse and worse. Im a member of what looks like a cult, and I don't even get what they teach. I had it explained to me but all it seems to be is they think all the other gods suck and the only hope for a good world is this god that's been long since forgotten about. So much so they don't even know his name.

It makes sense on paper but what stops this forgotten god from being as terrible as all the others? Well I have to go along with this as long as Im in town. And that involves having to pray for at least 3 hours a day. 

I got the fuck out of there and said Id come back tomorrow and learn the teachings. I take it back, the scar looks super gross. Its like a burn victims flesh but thinner, I hope it heals more cause as for now it looks like a scratch could cut it open.

Im never going back to that church of psychos, they could try to make me drink punch or something. This place is a lot less friendly than the starting town, in the game I skipped most of the dialogue but I did notice the colors got noticable more bleak. Guess this isn't a nice place to live. 

We met up with druid who looked somewhat pissed. Turns out they didn't have enough to get us a single room and were kicked out for begging for some discount. Id find it funny if it didn't mean we were homeless for the night, we meed to find a suitable ally to sleep in that doesn't have too many plague rats. Its so fucking cold. Why is it always cold!? 

I don't think I complain that much but this really is one of the worse situations we've been in since getting to this hellhole. 

We started talking while waiting to fall asleep, the topic turned to injuries since we got here. Healer wins in most fucked up but I get a nice second place. He has quantity over my quality.

Bard has a few cuts on his hands from playing the knife game with a fork while we were at the church, and recently with his new USED dagger.

Fighter thinks he broke a rib himself a while back from that bunny kicking him. He never said anything at the time which might be concerning.

Druid mumbled about how she tried to ride one of the horses back at the farm before I arrived and it bucked her completely off.

We all have blisters on our feet from walking and cuts on our hands from using crappy farming tools. A few hours of work with a hoe and you really wish you were dead.

I brought up the burn marks on everyone else and they looked at me like I had just said I eat orphans. Bard asked if I had one and I think my expression conveyed I did not. 

Druid pointed out how that was stupid and I was lucky. I asked for someone to explain as they all conversed as if they had some common knowledge I was not aware of.

Wiz pointed out how everyone here had touched the blue flame except for me. Kick, touch, fall into, all of them had touched that damn fire when they had arrived. Except for me.

I think that's a good sign that Im the only one in this group who's not an idiot of some kind. And Im ok with that.",stories,Death and Death session 5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnvrbg/death_and_death_session_5/,1613755354.0

Is it ok if I don’t show up in the classes for two weeks and self-quaratine myself?” I was lying to get a free two-week break to get prepared for the upcoming end-semester exams.

They approved my request. The next morning I had been having my pivotal life moment and was overjoyed until my phone rang. I pick it up, it’s the freshmen representative on the other end of the phone, he asks me to pack my stuff up for a 5-day hospital stay and ambulance will pick me up at 1 pm. I was like “but I’d like to stay at my place isn’t it better?”.  “if u resist, police will be involved and im sure you do not want to be forced to do it against your will. just go along with it. It’s for your own sake and especially other people, do you follow what I’m saying?” he replied. So might as well I had to get into the ambulance, stg I frightened the living soulout of my poor neighbors as they were staring at me stepping into the truck.

In the hospital, first off, two doctors questioned the places I’ve been to in the last week, the people i’ve met, where I met that student and when did the symptoms start appearing. Eventually after completing the questionnaire, they sent me to an isolated room with all the doors locked with only a small window facing the neighboring concrete wall. I had been communicating with the nurses through snapchat lol. Moreover, two PCR-test had to be taken and if the results come out negative, they’d let me go.

Four days passed by and don’t even get me started on how disgusting the hospital-foods taste, on the first day she brought me two food packagings one of which was soup that i don’t like at all, opening up the other one’s lid I could see cooked rice mixed with chopped beef and boiled potatoes, I was like uhm ok it’s better than nothing, I grabbed a spoon of rice meat and potato, when I bit down to it oh god...guess what?...it wasn’t potato!!! That was a piece of fucking pineapple *smfh* I hardly contained myself not to bust the door down, and grab a handful of pineapple to force-feed the lunatic working in the kitchen.

long story short, I took the PCR-test two times, then on the fifth day as I was ready to check out, the nurse came in with that spacesuit-looking isolation-gown, saying “could you pls sit down I’m going to collect some nasal samples for pcr test” I was like “wait a minute, I’ve done this two times alrdy, didn’t they come out negative?(i broke out in a cold sweat)”. “don’t panic, your second sample has got lost and we’re truly sry ab it. now we have to repeat it once more” she said  :/// I was completely baffled by it, told her to get it over with, I just wanna go home.

The absolute dreadful foods on one hand, having a cotton swab shoved all the way up your nose, elbow-deep that u can feel it touching the back of your head, not only once BUT THREE TIMES on the other fucking hand.

\-

It had always been just her and her grandparents after her mom died, and she never really questioned this family dynamic, until the first grade. All the girls in her class talked about how amazing their dads were, but the only dad she had ever known was her grandfather. It was normal to her, but she suddenly felt as if something was missing, like a part of her was stripped from her without her consent. However, when she asked her grandparents about it—why everyone else seemed to have a dad except for her—they simply changed the subject and left her with a shadow that had never really been there before, a curiosity without the means of an answer.

Perhaps that was when her fascination to know what was behind closed doors started.

\*\*\*

There was always this one room in her childhood home that no one ever went into, nor did they discuss it or interact with it. As a kid, she would often find herself staring at the closed door every time she was in the hallway, and over the years, she watched its wood fade with abandonment. At seven years old, she founwd the courage to ask about the room, but her grandmother was pushing her further away from the truth. Because of this, she felt guilty and never asked for much.

“Don’t ask about it again,” she scolded, as if it were bad behavior.

But, that didn’t stop her curiosity.

When she knew that no one was around to catch her, she walked to the lonely door, with caution of course. Her entire family had told her not to even get close to it without any reasoning. They knew something she didn’t, and that along with going behind their backs made her more anxious about the fact that she was doing this. 

Despite believing the door had always been locked, the doorknob clicked with ease, and she was able to slowly push the door open, avoiding the squeak that all the other doors in the house had. The door stood ajar as she caught a glimpse of the sun shining into her eyes as it beamed off conjoined, circular pieces of metal. 

She had only seen one on TV when bands were featured on MTV, but never did it cross her mind that she would find a drum set in the corner of that abandoned room. It baffled her, knowing that her family had kept this secret from her. And now, she wanted to know why.

She took one step onto the dusty, carpet floor before a hand pulled her back by the collar. Her grandmother gave her that wide-eyed, thin-lipped, “What did I tell you?” look as her other hand slammed the door shut and visibly locked it, slipping the key into the opening at the front of her shirt. 

“You just never listen,” her grandmother said with authority, and she was tugged further away from the closed door, its wood still faded but not forgotten. “C’mon, let’s get you ready for dinner. I made your favorite tonight.”

And that would be the last time that door would ever open, to her knowledge, and that was the last time she would see those drums in that house. 

\*\*\*

For the next twelve years, all she could think about were those drums. Even when they moved houses when she was ten, she wondered if her family had gotten them out without her knowing. Probably when she was at school or soccer practice. Her fascination for the instrument only grew from there, and once she entered high school, she wanted to be the next Roger Taylor, even attempting to mimic the Queen drummer’s every move. She would play with rhythms by taking anything slightly similar to drumsticks and tapping them on whatever surface was in front of her. At home, it was the kitchen table and her pencils during homework sessions. Her anxiety went through the roof whenever her grandparents entered the room while she did so, and she quickly set them down as if they remained untouched. At the high school cafeteria, she plugged herself into the world of music and continued to tap the table with her utensils to the beat of the drums in whatever song drifted from her mp3 player to her Sony headphones. But, no matter how hard she practiced or how determined she was, everything still seemed off-beat from the original, evident not only to her but those she surrounded herself with. It didn’t stop her from trying, at least. After a while it became a nuisance to her friends, and, although she was doing well in her classes, the teachers also found themselves annoyed when she would tap on her desk instead of reading silently. Even her soccer coach grew irritated that her mind could be on anything outside the world of soccer. And every single time, she would imagine herself playing on the drums that were merely a childhood memory behind closed doors, her hands clasping perfectly around the thin drumsticks, craving for them to be in her possession.

And yet, she never asked about them thanks to the anxiety that lingered from her childhood. As much as she wanted them, it just wasn’t worth the risk. Then there was the shadow, always looming.

\*\*\*

The Saturday after her high school graduation, her grandparents decided it would be a good time to clean the house and put their storage unit to good use so that they would have more room. Most of what she labeled as “junk” was hers, so she would do the majority of the work for them. Along with her grandparents, she approached the locked orange storage unit holding a box full of her memories: her last pair of soccer cleats, binders of notes from her high school classes, folded pieces of paper passed to her in middle school asking where to hang out at recess, pictures of people throughout her life that simply opted out of their friendships without any explanations. It was bittersweet, to say the least. 

She threw the box—one of many—into a nearby, dusty corner, particles springing up into the air almost instantly, once her grandfather unlocked the unit, happy to be rid of its contents. They then started to hand her boxes and instructed her on where they were to be placed, with her grandfather taking the heavier loads to ease the pain from her multiple sports injuries. She stepped between dusted-over crates to get where they wanted or where the boxes would fit, only to find herself surprised that she didn’t notice the large blue tarp at the farthest corner of the unit the moment she was exposed to the inside.

She looked behind her, and once she saw that they were occupied with taping together a broken box, she walked towards the mysterious tarp that was definitely trying hard to hide something. She grazed the surface and immediately felt a hard object underneath, almost like metal. 

She heard no disagreement behind her from her grandparents, and even if they had said anything before she could get her hands near the tarp, she wouldn’t have listened. Her curiosity had always gotten the best of her. This time, just as it had been when she was seven years old, it was for a good cause. 

She pulled the tarp back to reveal the red drums that had once sat undisturbed in her childhood home, now covered in dust after being abandoned for more than half her life. Of course, they had never been forgotten. From what she remembered about them, everything was the same: the vibrant, sheek red color, the shining cymbals, the word “Gretsch” finely printed on the main bass drum, the lonely drumsticks atop the drum attached to the right side of the set. 

She took one step forward, and it was as if she had been thrown back in time. Except, her grandmother was not pulling her back by the collar. She stopped herself, confused by the lack of this action, and turned around, meeting her grandparents’ eyes this time as they stood in silence. More than anything, she was perplexed as to why she and these drums were not meant to be. 

“Y’all suck at hiding these things from me,” she said. 

Her grandfather straightened his Dallas Cowboys hat. “We weren’t trying to this time.”

She scoffed, and, after eleven years, she confronted them. 

“Why now, then? I don’t get it. You’ve been keeping them from me for as long as I can remember, and for what? For them to just sit here without being used?”

She didn’t even wait for an answer. She walked over to the drums as if they were a newborn. She was quiet and in awe as her fingertips delicately ran over the edges of the cymbals. They were cool to the touch, and also dirty. She rubbed away the dust and merely admired the drums in that moment. 

She continued. “I want the truth. No more locked doors.”

They weren’t really saying much now, only expressing a guilt on their faces she had never seen before. Her grandparents looked to each other, then back at her, all while her grandmother took in a deep breath before breaking the silence.

“Look at the drumsticks.”

She did as she was told and stepped behind the set to grab the wooden sticks. They fit within her hands as perfectly as she had imagined. She inspected them carefully, thinking there was something wrong with them, but instead found a name engraved at the base of them. *David*. There was that shadow again, she could feel it strongly this time, more than ever. 

“These drums were your father’s,” her grandmother went on.

It was the first time her father had ever been mentioned, by them at least. He had just been a silhouette in her mind. No face, no name. Until now. She had a name, and that was it. Her eyes refused to look away from his name. *David*. She tapped on one of the drums with one of the sticks, and its sharp *crack* reverberated through the unit, startling her because she had forgotten where she was for a split second. He was beginning to seem less than a shadow and more of a person. She started to think about what he was like, with a regular name and drum talent. Maybe he was as cool as Roger Taylor. Maybe he *was* Roger Taylor and this was his alias. So many possibilities. Still, she wasn’t sure if she should smile.

“When he found out about you,” her grandfather jumped in to explain, adjusting his hat again, “he set these aside for you to have when you got older.”

After all this time, the part of her she never knew about, the part of her she longed to find, was starting to come together. She wanted to know more until there was nothing left, but the heavy weight in her chest restricted her from asking any questions. And so she listened. 

“We didn’t want to force you into it, especially at such a young age,” her grandmother confessed, as if she had been holding onto that secret for almost twenty years, “but we also couldn’t take away the choice in case you got more curious as you got older. We kept them until the day you asked about him again, or even until you asked about the drums.”

Her grasp around the drumsticks tightened, feeling his name engraving itself into the inside of her palm, burning itself into her skin. If only she hadn’t let her anxiety get the best of her, the first and only time it had ever surpassed her curiosity. She could have been living her dream by now, maybe even been one step closer to meeting the drummer of her favorite rock band, or knowing more about her dad.  

“Would you like to see him?”

Her grandmother’s question caught her off-guard. She swallowed all of the questions that had formed in her throat, to ask later in a different setting and better state of mind, and she simply nodded. Her grandmother made her way around the boxes to get closer to her, then reached into her purse and pulled out a single photo. From where she stood, she could see that it was a picture of an unfamiliar man standing beside the mother she was never able to meet due to a god awful influenza season that stripped her from parenthood, both smiling at the camera as if they were excited for their future. Her grandmother held it up for her to see more clearly. The shadow, then, consumed her. 

“So that’s him.”

She was finally able to find her voice again, all while noticing more and more of his details as she continued to stare at the photo. She had her father’s eyes, his small ears. Their hair was even the same color, hers resting at her waist. It was too much information for her to take in at once. She ran a single hand through her hair, and she was silent again, still holding onto the drumsticks as she sunk down into the stool behind the drum set, battling between feeling anger at him for leaving her behind or relief that her questions were now being answered. She blinked her eyes and peered down at the drum set to distract her from the picture, for just a moment. She was where her father once was, excluding the change of setting, and while she had been imagining what it would be like to own these exact drums for the past eleven years, she wasn’t really sure how to feel now that they were finally hers. She breathed in and tapped the same drum as earlier. Another *crack*. She let out a breath. She allowed her foot to rest on the pedal that controlled the bass drum. A soft *boom*. Her heartbeat settled to its normal rate, as if the drums had commanded it to do so. 

“I’d like to know more about him,” she said, hesitant, “but not right now, if that’s alright with you.”

Both of her grandparents nodded, and they smiled as they watched her choose her fate. She had never resented the way she was brought up; right now, she was more thankful than anything. Now that she was older, they were opening doors to parts of her she never knew about. She glanced down again at his engraved name, feeling that missing part of her beginning to tie together for the first time. He even knew how to write proper cursive. They were more alike than she ever thought they would be.

\*\*\*

They talked with the owner of the storage units, and with his help, she was able to bring the drum set home that day. She placed the drums in the corner of her own bedroom, where they remained for the rest of the time she lived under that roof, no longer abandoned. She continued to play by ear, which proved to be challenging with an actual drum set as opposed to a table and some pencils, but it was also worth it. Overtime, she felt a connection with her distant father through the rhythms of the songs she played, like his spirit was helping her find her own rhythm. And everywhere she was able to play, she would play as if he were in the back of the room. Taped to the stand nearest where she sat was the picture of her mother and father. It would take her a little while longer to even gather up the courage to try and find him, but at least the door wasn’t closed anymore. It wasn’t entirely open, either. She was leaving it cracked for now, cracked with the curiosity that led her there and the hope that she could one day play for him and actually see his face, hopefully a smiling one, in the back of the room when the time came.",stories,"A story I wrote a few years ago, about finding out who my dad is.

(story begins in 4th paragraph)

I first tried meth when I was 18. It was the last major drug I tried for obvious reasons, maybe crack and pcp are higher on the stigma list but I wouldn't really call them mainstream drugs

Society brands it the scum of all drugs. Meth just sounds dirty as a word even to someone drug obsessed like me. The stigma is weird, with a lot of people seemingly relating it to dramatasized news articles of a different drug (bath salts) and thinking you will go around biting people's faces off and eating cops while suffering simultaneous heart attack, seizure and painful erection. It brings images of crackheads, death, addiction and breaking bad. Its the 'being a smoker' of the drug world, with half of drug users writing it off immediately.

Does it deserve this stigma? Well I was prepared to find out, after all everything else I heard about drugs was wrong, maybe meth would cure my anxiety problems

So I was with some poor criminals sitting around trying to sell a g shock I had bought just a few weeks earlier when I was a small time wealthyish opioid dealer but somehow ended up back on the street, a good representation of the drug world in general

We were doing it to buy weed but the criminals decided they wanted meth and they were bigger than me so meth it was, I still wasn't prepared to do it though, I will just get drunk instead I thought.

Don't get drunk if you don't want to try a drug. I soon developed a facination with the hypnotic vapour they were inhaling and none of them had exploded yet so I gave it a go

I was prepared for my lungs to melt from some weird acid they used to cook the salt like substance in front of me but to my surprise it actually tasted nice. Kind of had a very mild chemical taste like a scientific perfume or something and didn't burn at all. I sat back and prepared for the heart attack I was sure would follow but after a few minutes nothing had really changed so I took another few hits and sat back. About a minute later I felt a rush of sorts coming along, kind of like I was being blown back by an invisible wind and all my skin cells began to tingle. I soon realized however it was not the body high that kept these people sucking the dicks of truckers worldwide.

I felt smart. If any drug comes close to the limitless drug it was meth. It felt very similar to Ritalin but kind of like someone threw in some mdma and sprinkled some tramadol on top. My intense existence induced depression disappeared completely. I was happy. I felt the barriers of the room disappear.

I was a little white kid in a house with big black Maori warriors in it. There was bloods memorabilia all over the wall, weird we have sects of the bloods and crips here in NZ, but to say the least the environment I was in was scary, dangerous and generally all round terrible. 5 year old kids were playing as their father and my gang patched friend smoked meth in the kitchen.

I felt more confident than I had ever been in my life. To me it didn't seem too forced either, I was well aware of the speedy talking and general sentence rape stim freaks were hated for so my brain - that had legitimately started sticking out of my nostrils by this point - watched over me talking to finely tune me into the most cultured, best sounding person to ever live.

I had goosebumps and was very happy, but not otherworldly though, none of this was what I thought it'd be. I didn't have the urge to start running down the street screaming like Jonah Hill in the wolf of wall street. I couldn't (seemingly) lift buildings yet, and I wasn't having the intense constant all over body orgasm I was promised for taking such a risk.

I felt good but I could easily function in normal life. Like I said it felt a lot like Ritalin only like maybe 3 times better. It was easily at the top of the drug list though, but far below opioids still. A solid number 2 on the main rankings but a number 1 in pure euphoria. If $100 (fucking NZ prices) and a pipe could induce such a euphoria on command it easily deserved such a spot. I didn't have to sit through 9 hours of brain fuckery like acid or cry my eyes out on Molly to feel such a solid all round great euphoria and high in general so It was worthy.

Much better than promised I thought. The ridiculous things they said would happen didn't and so even though I wasn't having a melting orgasm I also wasn't being shot by police so I was happy with it. I knew not to do this often though so far, this wasn't worth the effects it had on the brain for me. Without a solid brain I would never get out of the shithole hood I had put myself in but I'm not going to lie though and say the weird meth face was by far the biggest deterant.

It lasted hours in which I didnt sleep and food made me gag, I was extremely horny and my jaw wouldnt stop moving about. Then I finally started getting the famed comedown of this drug. It has to be pretty fucking bad for me to put this drug down the list I thought. It was indeed pretty fucking bad.

I started sweating so much I thought I may melt. My heart began to palpitate and I kept being hit with massive waves of extreme depression and pure anxiety. I felt like I was waiting for a long prison sentence or a plane to crash. But then I would fall back into bliss for a while. It felt like I was glitching out and I could no longer really enjoy the euphoria knowing what would soon come.

Soon the anxiety hit extreme levels. I was convinced I would soon suffer heart failure and I needed to get to hospital to even have a chance of surviving that. So I started walking there quickly. Unfortunately my friend was also suffering the same anxiety, but his, like most people's, was external. He thought I was planning to get him imprisoned for life over him passing me a meth pipe and this ended in us almost comically fighting at the hospital door being stared at by dozens of people until I just decided to stop yelling and walk in.

I shakily walked to the admitting nurse and very anxiously explained I smoked meth and I was now certainly going to die, all while my friend sat outside furiously staring me down, seemingly unable to enter the hospital door.

I sat down and began to get annoyed I could no longer yell at him because at least that took my mind away from the problem, my pussy bitch heart that always got me in these fucking situations. All the images of seizuring overdoses and death entered my mind. Every dramatic news story of meth overdoses and crying mother's flowed through over and over in a non-stop shuffle mode. I didn't want to die i was too young, I hadnt even lived long enough to see my acne disappear and women to start swarming me for the Brad Pitt lookalike I truly was. I started audibly saying fuck quietly over and over. I was experiencing true fear with small bursts of euphoria intertwined.

Suddenly a retarded lady collapsed and started seizuring and screaming on the floor. I actually covered my ears because I couldn't handle it, like her screams were my one weakness. It wasnt working, all the movement of nurses and doctors running in to help threw me overboard and I nearly threw up as I tried to respectfully walk out of the door mid brain seizure.

I screamed quietly many times as I walked home, angry my fucking beta heart wouldn't stop dying on me. The chest pain and palpitations were unbearable. I can't remember the rest but I finally fell asleep hours later completely drained of life and sure I would never awaken again

Since then I have done meth maybe one or twice a year max, but it's always a 2 or 9 day binge. I learned benzos can almost completely eliminate the negatives of the comedown and trip in general. Saying that, I plan to eliminate it from use before I'm 25 for fear I will eventually succumb to a meth face and never see a vagina on a 2 yearly basis again.",stories,Trying Meth for first time,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnt5yv/trying_meth_for_first_time/,1613747732.0

144,halfawink,1613764133,"I have an aversion to doing anything. If given a choice I would lie in bed all day absorbing all the entertainment content online and lead a hedonistic lifestyle. This aversion particularly flares up in the form of extreme procrastination when I have to do things that are of importance and consequences. 

Obviously this isn't healthy and I would have to change sooner or later, and I'm afraid that changing ""later"" might entail heavier consequences. (""Obviously"" refering to ""there's no free lunch in this world"", unless I strike the lottery. But till then, this lifestyle is highly unsustainable for me.)

This aversion to doing important things is affecting me, even right now, because I'm not doing the things that I'm supposed to be doing. Out of coincidence, a common banter with my brother brought this topic up and got me thinking about this root of my problems. 

Below, I will attempt to analyze and find a solution other than ""sucking it up"". Just think about how many New Year resolutions are broken all over the world just because that very person thought that he/she should suck it up, but didn't in the long run. I'd like to think that I'm not using this explanation as a blanket excuse for being weak-minded. I was just thinking that instead of just biting the bullet, there might be something or a goal to chase after that makes everything worthwhile. And finding this will affect my decisions in the long run.

~~Wow I'm writing so much before even writing about the main topic. This is clearly a sign of my extreme procrastination kicking in. ~~

To find the root of the problem which is essentially, what causes my [aversion to important and difficult things]. 

I think that part of me is not confident with... me. As in, if after the change I revert back to my old self, the irreversible changes that I had made before I revert will bite me in the ass because I didn't maintain the required lifestyle indefinitely. Then comes a pessimistic view of nothing matters, because if I'm inclined to never change, I would never succeed in society. Sure I might never starve to death but I'd prefer to live a more fulfilling life. Hopefully this isn't too much to ask for.

~~Side note I'm so tired but I wanna keep writing in case procrastination takes over me tomorrow. ~~

Aversion to doing difficult things. Funny thing is, I have done *relatively* difficult things in the past, but looking back I will only find it worth it if I get some sort of acknowledgement, the more the better. Perhaps this is a way of me justifying my efforts, or maybe it just fulfills my hidden, deep rooted fear of not being enough. 

Expanding on ""deep rooted fear of not being enough"", I guess it stemmed from having my asian parents inculcation of *their* values, including intentionally distancing myself from others to prevent being hurt. This probably is the reason I never had the tact for making friends. (Not that I dont have any, but I feel that all my friends that I have came from luck. Though that doesn't make me cherish them any more or less I think that the walls I have built up around me all these years have to go) To a certain extent I have difficulties making new friends, and maybe from this stemmed my fear of not being acknowledged.

145,Rose_Gold_Raven_36,1613763424,"So, a friend and I were talking about one of my many original characters and some BNHA characters. I was saying how my friends oc, let’s call her May, could possibly be kidnapped a second time. She’s writing a story on Wattpad and I allowed her to use one of my oc’s, Carl, in her story. I was saying that if May’s oc was kidnapped a second time, to send Carl in and disguise as Toga. We both laughed and imagined the image of Carl dressed in Togas clothes just to sneak into a villains base. Short while later, I told her that I couldn’t get the image out of my head. I explained it as “Imagined him stripping her while she’s unconscious and sneaking into the base.” Not really funny, but at least something worth sharing because it’s dumb 😂",stories,This may have made him uncomfortable even if he is fake...,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnogwc/this_may_have_made_him_uncomfortable_even_if_he/,1613734624.0
146,JustSayDude,1613761252,"This is a story about my childhood home. Yeah, I know, how cliche...

But I think this is a story I need to tell. At least here I can probably get answers...

The house I grew up in was old, like really old. It was made in the late 1920s, and hasn’t been changed since. Spacious living room, small kitchen, all wooden floors, the works. Things have been changed to taste from time to time, but nonetheless remains the same old house. It may seem like a lovely home to live in, except for one thing, the basement. Everything down there is exactly as it originally was, the cracked concrete foundation, the stairs, the storm windows, the laundry chute, even the shelving and workbench my Dad uses. But the most ancient, and most unsettling, of those things was the back closet at the far side of the basement. It was an extremely small room with a door made of planks, could only stay closed by a hook, and that had a sealed off window with a solid iron plate on both sides, with its hinges completely rusted shut. When my family moved in, it was deemed the *perfect* place to put things into storage. Like our holiday decorations, old mementos, and things that were intended for donations. But there was something off about that room.

There was always this creepy feeling I got from that room. Like there was something in there that was...evil. Not many people in my family listened to me at first when I expressed my worries. Because who really listens to a little kid when they say something looks scary, we all know how well that goes in horror movies, huh? However, this sense of worry did not fade, not even when I had the reassurance of my parents and older brothers. And a few instances in the span of a few years would justify it.

The earliest instance I remember was when I was six years old. I was down in the basement playing with a bouncy ball. At one point, I had bounced it really low and it went inside the cracked-open door of the closet. This was also around the time when my fear for the place began to develop, so I was really hesitant to go inside, especially since I was all alone down there. Eventually I worked up enough courage to go in, but not without turning on a light outside to be able to see my way and check for *anything else* in there. So I opened the door all the way, and went inside. Immediately, I felt this cold, breezy feeling wash over me. But, that was just because it was a basement, maybe. I saw my ball sitting in the middle of the floor and went to go pick it up.

However, after taking only one step inside the room, I felt afraid. I had no idea why, but I felt immediately scared after barely entering the room. It was terrifying, I had never felt this kind of fear before. Then, I felt like someone was behind me. But I was all alone, right? When I turned around however, I saw no one. What I did see a shadow move out of the corner of my eye, going into the opposite wall.

I was ready to leave, I had enough of this. But as I made my way to the door, I heard this loud, otherworldly shriek. It was the kind that you can only hear out of monsters in a horror movie. But I heard it, and it was coming right behind me.

Instantly, I screamed and ran as fast as I could, away from, whatever that was. Out of the room, across the basement, up the stairs and into the kitchen. My mom heard me screaming from the living room, so she came out to see what was wrong. I could barely speak, I was panting, crying, freaking out. But I told her what happened, and she went down to the basement to see for herself. But when we got there, there was nothing. No monster, no ghost, no anything. Just the closet with the door wide open, everything exactly as it was left. Even when my Dad had come home hours later and I told him the same story, with him having the suspicion of vermin, he didn’t find any.

The next instance is a bit less anticlimactic, but still spooky.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was nine, my cousins were over at our house to play for the afternoon. We were in a game of hide-and-seek, with me being the seeker. I had found my brother and my young cousin Girl, but I couldn’t find my other cousin, Boy. We were looking all over the house for him, when my brother brought up the idea to go look in the basement.

We went down, and at first we didn’t know where he could be. But when I called for him to come out, he did...out of the closet in the back.

We asked how long he was down here before we found him, but he gave us a weird look. Boy looked at me and said, “I thought you came down here already.” I told him I was not and it might have been someone else. He replied, “But I heard you knock on the door from where I was hiding. I even saw your shadow!” Again, I denied it was me, with my brother and Girl backing me up. When we went upstairs to ask if any of the adults were downstairs, they had the same response.

The Basement Closet always rubbed me the wrong way, even before the first two incidents. It was just one of those things that you just know is wrong, but can’t exactly pin down why. I learned my reason why, through one of the most horrifying experiences of my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

It all happened when I was twelve, when I was moving into my new room in the basement. For context, There is this makeshift room next to the closet that was made into a third bedroom for the house. It belonged to my oldest brother for a long time, so when he moved out, it came down between me and my other brother to claim ownership, and I ended up getting it.

It was my first time sleeping without my brother close by on our bunk-bed, and it made me nervous to be inhabiting a completely dark, cold environment for an entire night. So when I had first slept in the basement, I had both eyes open for hours. It felt like if I had closed my eyes for even a second, something would jump out of the shadows and attack me.

However, after the first couple of weeks, my fear began to etch slowly away. I had gotten nightlights to see my way around, my cat would jump onto the bed to sleep with me, and I just felt more comfortable being there in general. However, one night, that all changed.

I remember I had woken up at random in the middle of the night, for no reason. This is actually a pretty common thing for me, so I wasn’t too weirded out when it happened. Usually this meant I had to just move around a bit or go to the bathroom, then I would fall right back to sleep. So, I felt like maybe I should try to sit up and get moving to tire myself out. But, I couldn’t move. I felt frozen, it was like my arms and legs were made of stone, and all I could move was my torso. I squirmed for what felt like an hour, but I could move anywhere. I had asked aloud “What?”, but where it *should have* come out my normal speaking volume, all that was said was a whisper. At this point, I began to think this was some kind of crazy dream, so I tried to close and open my eyes a bunch of times to try and wake up. But it wasn’t working, no matter how many times I tried.

On my fifth attempt to “wake up”, I heard something outside my room. It was that damned door of the closet opening. But this wasn’t your average, creaky door opening kind of thing. That door was slammed open...from the inside. I instantly seized up and began to listen. From the pathway from the closet to the front of my room, I heard slow dragging footsteps, each one getting louder and more thunderous than the last, and they were moving towards the entrance of my room. I was screaming and screaming for someone, *anyone* to come help me, but all that came out were barely audible whispers, no matter how loud I tried to make them. When I had stopped yelling, so did the footsteps. My eyes acted on their own, squeezing so tightly shut it hurt my eyes. I was praying for this all to just be some horrible nightmare, and to just *please let me wake up.* For a while, everything was quiet and still, almost like it never happened. Until I decided to open my eyes.

What I saw was something that still gives me shivers, even now. Inside the entryway to my room was a figure. It was a tall, lanky shadowy creature, with arms and legs twice the length of a normal person’s. Its neck was toothpick-thin, holding up a large, oblong head. It’s face was what terrified me the most. It was a shifting, changing mess of dark tentacles of shadows, with no visible features. Other than two enormous, glowing white eyes, looking ready to bust out their sockets.

I could only stare at it, in shock and in fear. Which increased tenfold, when it began to walk towards me.

I went into overdrive, thrashing and hollering for help. I didn’t care who would come, I just wanted to get away. But then, my torso seized up, and wouldn’t move any more, no matter how much force I would use. Then went my voice, as my lips felt like they were clamped in a mousetrap, and no sounds were coming out. Meanwhile, this *thing* was walking closer and closer to my bed, and it seemed to get taller and taller the more it moved. Now it was just me, a mute, limp ragdoll against this demon or monster, or WHATEVER this was.

But, it didn’t do anything, it just stared down at me, its white eyes piercing into my soul, with me silently begging the thing to just *please go away* and *don’t hurt me.* But it didn’t, it didn’t do anything period. All it did was stare at me.

Then it raised it’s hand up from the side of its body and held it over my face. I can still remember how it looked in front of me, a lanky skeleton of barely tangible fingers, sinew and shadows blurring together into a vague shape of what should have been a hand, fingers curling down and around my face.

That’s the last thing I remember before I jolted awake, falling onto my floor in a tangle of sheets and screams. My heart felt ready to explode, breathing was more of a challenge, and my skin had felt like it was stabbed with hundreds of thousands of needles. I was still in panic mode from whatever the hell that whole experience was. My parents heard the commotion, and ran downstairs like lightning. The second they saw my state, they knew something was wrong, but seeing that I was physically okay they were relieved.

I sent them back upstairs, and somehow, managed to fall back asleep.

I woke up the next morning, feeling drained. At first I didn't know why, until I remembered the horror show of last night. A feeling of caution came over me. Like an unseen threat was coming, but I was nervous to find out what.

As I was walking out of my room, I had the urge to look at the closet. As if it would give me an answer to what happened to me. I had a flashlight in my hand to navigate my way without the basement lights on, so I pointed my beam in the pathway of the closet.

When I had moved in front of the door, I felt my heart stop. The rickety, ancient door that was held up by barely usable hinges, held shut only by a hook and hoop latch, was open. Not at an angle like it normally would be as opened, this looked like it was thrown open, flat against the wall to its side, and the wood dented from the concrete and spackle.

It definitely was closed the night before.

Quickly, I shut the door, latched it, and shoved a nearby stack of boxes in front of it. The second I was done, I bolted up the stairs, not wanting to look back for a second.

What did that? Who opened the door? Why did I have that dream? What was that thing?

Later that day when I got home from school, I went back down to the basement. The boxes were still there, and the door was still shut.

I went into my room, found duct tape, and a marker. I moved the boxes out of my way, drew 6 crosses on the door (one for each plank on the door), and made one out of the tape on top of the door.

I didn't believe in that kind of stuff, but my thought was that if they were there, it would stop.

Strangely enough, I think it worked. Nothing else has happened since that night, but there are still some creepy things that occur.

I can hear groaning through the wall where the closet is. Sometimes on one spot on the wall is a really cold patch of space, like a freezer was behind it. There was one time that I had heard tapping in the wall, like a fingernail on a window. It did not stop until morning.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I really am typing this story, is because of something that happened to me last night. I was remembering the events of the Basement Closet Scares, but I felt something bugging me. I didn't know whether or not all of those experiences were real, or something of my imagination.

So, I decided to find out go find out for myself.

I went inside, armed with a candle (I wanted to see if I can talk to the entity), and had the outside lightbulb on. I creaked the door shut, me standing with my back to it, just in case.

I lit the candle, and held it out in front of me. I asked my first question, ""Is anyone there?""

At first, nothing. After a few seconds, though, the flame began to flicker. I asked again ""Is someone there?""

More quickly this time, the flame flickered.

""Do you know who I am?"" '*Flicker'*

""Have you been here a long time? *'Flicker'*

""Is this where you died?"" *'Nothing'*

""Is this where you reside?"" *'Flick'*

""Can you do anything?"" *'Wavering'*

""Did you hear me? Can you do anything to show me you're there?""

I began to back out of the room, looking around the room, watching the walls. I focused on one corner of the room, something was there, nothing physically, but I knew something was there.

Just then, my thumb holding the candle felt something hot fall on it. I gasped, nearly dropping the candle and stumbling back out of the closet.

I pushed the door shut fast, blew out the candle, and turned off the light. I ran into my room, and looked down at my thumb. Hot candle wax had fallen on my thumb, burning the skin and hitting my nail. But I was holding the candle still, how did any wax fall onto my hand?

I can't stop thinking about it now. So I turned to here, asking for help.

I'm not asking for similar experiences, even if they are exactly like my own, I NEED an answer for once about what the hell is wrong.

147,Edict2040,1613759997,"Last year there were 114 space launches of which 104 were successful. That is 2 a week and 25% more than three years prior. Extrapolate that and by 2029 humanity will be delivering 221 launches per annum. No wonder everyone is getting their rockets ready.

But behind these numbers there is a much simpler equation. Every time a rocket ascends the sky it carries everything humans need to survive in space, and at $2,720 per kilo that is a long way down from the $18,500 price tag of 2020.  

However, those savings have been made, it still costs a lot to launch even the most cost-efficient rocket, so every kilo of cargo must be carefully considered and balanced against other requirements. And every saving is budgetarily important. So where can savings be made?

While the immediate term savings will come for reusable rockets and more efficient engines like Raptor and BE-4, these vehicles will have to carry everything into space to build the next generation of orbital platform, Lunar Gateway and everything else needed to go to Mars and beyond.

And while current rocket technology is relatively lightweight, designed for limited distances and protected by the Earth’s magnetic field, rockets designed to go deeper into space will need to be better shielded both from micro asteroid impact and radiation. So that is a lot of weight to haul into orbit unless we find a better, more economical source.

Much has been made about asteroid mining. Indeed, a couple of enthusiastic proponents went so far as to launch companies, raise money and… then realise how long term a goal asteroid mining really turns out to be. They went bust or got bought cheap and went quiet after all the hullaballoo. 

Asteroid mining is more than going and getting. Systems need to be invented that would work remotely, a proven vehicle to journey to the asteroid, collect it and haul it back needs to be designed, tested, and then proven to be reliable enough to get insurance. (A good benchmark for everything commercial is ‘can we get insurance?’ If you cannot, chances are it is not a good commercial prospect for institutional investors or even cavalier billionaires. Not when there are tons of asteroids lying around on the surface of the moon that are a lot easier to collect. These asteroids also come with a lot of obvious benefits already referred to when it comes to the local. When the last metal asteroid has been melted and put through a 3D printer, there is still plenty of iron ore to go for. And mooncrete.
If our ingenuity manages to get some manufacturing capacity working on the moon by the end of the decade then there is a real shot that we will see a sustainable colony on Mars by 2050 (and the Moon by 2035).

“It  isn’t what it seems I promise. The lie has been said a thousand times,  yet I will repeat it once more. Listen closely I would not like to waste  these  invaluable words. Impetuous accusations flung at the farthest of our  imaginings. Listen closely I must speak quickly. There is an exit. It is  hidden within your mind if you would just listen! Quiet, Quiet I can hear them coming!” 

Wooden sticks clacked loudly across the prison bars. “You think this is a game! Shut the fuck up in there!” The two guards dressed in the drabbest of gray walked by flashing bright lights directly in our eyes. At the end of the hall, the wardens stopped and turned facing the long row of cells. “I will kill each and every one of you. In this... I shit you not.” I tried as best I could to get a better look at the men's faces, Covered and hiding the men cowered behind their masks. 

“Worry  not my child they will be back! We will be ready for them!” I tried to  peer into my neighboring cell to see who called on me. He eluded me retreating into the corners. “Shimmy my friend... Shimmy!” I lingered as long as I could at that cold metal. The halls stretched indefinitely. If only I could pop out this eye and... “Hurry boy to the walls!” I could feel the mania setting in, medication is truly what I needed. “G..” A screeching noise cut off my cries. The piercing screams tore through my mind. His howling enacted a horrifying response from the inmates who pelted him with obscenities. His terrified screams deafened me, and I clasped my ears just if to quiet the sound. They radiated from me I begged for it to stop. 

The loud rolling of metal bars sent me into panic. What if they knew? They didn’t know my guilt! They could not see. “To the walls.” I slammed my back on the cold concrete and hid myself from the loud footsteps. “That one... open it.” He could hear the man who had been the cause of all this misery. What whispers! He flung himself wildly into the walls. Weeping as if consumed by drink, he could not accept this fate. I sat listening to the club footed men descend the hallway. The lights once again crossed my weak frame exposing me to the outsiders. They stopped for a brief moment and then continued. I rose and clung myself to the bars. The sycophant had begun his weeping moans once again. “Kill him! Oh, what whispers! Kill the liar!” 

A stick perforated my jaw causing me to fall backwards into the hard concrete. “You’ll get yours next, don’t you worry.” What infamy this man had wrought. I spat at the ground which held me. The men had started their obfuscation of the damned. He screamed in agony as the wooden sticks crushed his weak bones. I called out to them. “Weaklings! Cravens!” What had consumed me? Perhaps those whispers had done their dirty work. The pounding of the man's flesh had ceased, lingering words spilt back and forth. The men dressed in gray appeared from the diluted cell and faced me. “Backup inmate.” I stood my ground. The stick poked its way through. I faced these madmen. I accepted death in that moment, yet I cried for forgiveness.  

My protection, my home! Raising their wands, they wished to harm me. I curled in a ball and sobbed incessantly. The sticks never came. I howled for release from this judgement and the batons never rained. Perhaps it was pity. There I lay, a madman who just needed his medicine and they showed mercy. I lowered my arms to stare at the brazen man in gray as they showered me with sympathy. I reached for them. 

I  did not react as the shower of blood coated me. That whisperer! That  fiend! A wild blade he swung; how could he escape this! The suits tried to protect themselves, but the sharpened steel sliced them. Red streaks lined the walls. In total silence the man murdered them. After they had passed, he continued his charade. The knife cutting deeper and deeper each time. He soaked in their blood. A sort of ritual for this damned soul. He  leaned back and stuck his bloody fingers in his mouth. Sucking them he  tasted that cool red. My mouth watered. “Shimmy my friend...Shimmy.” He  grasped me by my arm dragging me from my place of confidence.  

He led me by arm, stumbling I tried to keep up with the madman who swung his blade wildly. His gray clothes hung loosely from his small frame. He was coated in warm blood; a stink arose from him. Men in cages... like animals watched as we made our escape. My home! What was I thinking! I lashed out wildly at the beast. He released his hand and turned slowly. He pointed that blade at me. “It isn’t what it seems... There is an exit.” I turned from him and retreated to my cell. Stepping lightly, I did not disturb the dead. The warm cot was waiting for me, so I embraced it. Finally... peace and quiet. Even as the sirens blared, I slept and dreamed of the whisperer.",stories,Where We Dream,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnmjn9/where_we_dream/,1613729759.0

Sunset over Western Kansas, 1875. (long take) The camera pans over expansive prairies and sunflowers before making its way to Dodge City, KS and to the saloon. Inside we find it busy and bustling, too loud to pick out any one conversation. We find a group of rough men are playing cards before a flash of light bursts overhead three times before staying lit, lighting the night as day. They all wander out to find aliens exiting their ships. 

Cut to credits, Black Heart by Calexico plays over story snippets explaining the worlds unification, how every city worldwide was met at the same time in the same fashion. We see an antebellum USA, over the period of five years, united with “Cyberpunk” style technology: Instant communication, enhanced solar power engines for their trains, flight, computer technology and wireless electric currents—a wild west world with technology far more advanced than our own. The alien race has not united just the country, but forced worldwide awareness and created instant globalization, though international travel is still exceedingly rare. The aliens are shown to have forced a kind of uneasy peace, implemented the technology in parts and suddenly disappeares.

We see that technology has been implemented worldwide, though the most advanced tech is still exceedingly rare, and we learn of the obvious creation of a few elite super soldiers.

Colby, KS July 13th,1880

Cut to unknown woman, African American, very athletic build, scarred heavily but still beautiful. We see her get ready for her morning, buckling her gun belt around her waist--a revolver with a large cylinder but no actual holes/ammo in it to on one side, a badge the shape of a star with 8 points on the other, and watch leave her hotel room in a brief clip as she heads out the day.
Camera includes cuts into our main characters perspective, where we see she has a high-tech HUD implemented into her vision. It includes threat assessments, highlighting each people with an appropriate color (green-no threat, yellow- some threat, blue-equal, red-high level threat). Everyone No-Name sees green. 
Outside exterior shows a small but bustling wild-west city. A disconnect created between the marriage of future tech with the western style is embraced, creating a kind of cyber-western feel (ie GIFs of wanted posters on flat led screens). There are low level enhancements everywhere, although most regular people can’t afford them. We see that well over half of the people still have no enhancements, and walk with our hero (who will remain un-named until a past reveal later in the story) as she takes a short walk to her horse. Passersby are clearly frightened of her and give her a wide berth as she passes.

As she readies her horse (who also has a myriad of cybernetic enhancements we don’t clearly see) we hear a bing and she touches her ear like an earpiece is there.
No-name: yep (answering the phone; spits)
Caller: targets should be rustlin to your Vectro-Graph now
She pauses from checking her saddle to turn her forearm over, a holographic screen emits from a small bit of light and shows a wanted poster.
Caller: we got quite a few for ya this time, three mandatory pulses, two discretionary. Should keep ya busy for a good bit of time this go round.
The caller (male) has a friendly report with the mercenary, and the two clearly get along despite her near silence. She is the best at what she does, and he treats her as such.
Caller:  Your first target is in the southern Flint Hills, feller by the name of Tyrell Bell, real scumbag type. They caught him traveling slaves in Texas, then he escaped and took three marshals out in the process. Luck be it, he’s ours now and his pulse is up to you. Second and third are traveling together, and you gotta bring them in alive. They should be up north a ways between Emporia and Topeka. Gang was trynna pull a train robbery went wrong. Word is the rest of the gang ate it and these two, Yeshua Lejuene and Andrew Weston is what’s left of em. Round em up and bring ‘em to whichever jail they’re closer to, Governor St. John wants to see last of The Dorsey Gang Hang.
The vectro-Graph shows images of wanted posters with high def pics and info:
Tyrell Bell: Male, 43, White, long blond hair covered in a cowboy hat, black eyes, mustache and thick chops, several teeth missing, broad nose and a deep scar across his forehead. 5’5 and 200 pounds; lightly enhanced (AUG 1): LEGs Group 1 Strength and Speed, no built-ins
Yeshua Lejeune: Male 39, White, cropped brown hair, clean shaven, brown eyes, stained but good teeth, generically handsome, 6’0 and 175 pounds; No known enhancements.
Andrew Weston: Male 33 White, Shaggy brown hair, scraggly beard and blue eyes, buck teeth. 5’9 and 170 pounds; no known enhancements.
Clinton Kurtz: Male, 40, White, balding messy brown hair, large forehead with wide set eyes and a toothless cupid-brow mouth over his prominent chin. 6’5 and 240 pounds, muscular but flabby; moderately enhanced (AUG 2): LEGs Group 2, Strength, Speed and Endurance/Stability; ToRSO Group 1, Endurance/Durability; Built in Multi-shot on Right-arm, expandable shield from left.
Annette Glory: Female, 53, Black, braided hair with large, wide set eyes, good teeth and overall attractive features. 5’5 and 145 pounds, unknown enhancements.


Camera cuts between the two speakers, leaving the callers face obscured above the mouth, and the device as the conversation goes on.
No-name: and what if there’s more of ‘em left? Sounds like a trap.
Caller: if you can bring more in breathin, pay’ll be better, but those are the only two the Governor expects back alive. Shouldn’t be much of a problem either way.
No-name: I reckon not. The last two?
Caller: Right. Your fourth target is one I’m sure you already know- Clinton Kurtz. His exact location is unknown, but we have solid intel he’ll bein Omaha sometime between the 15th and 21st for an as of yet unknown amount of time. The train’ll take you if you don’t wanna ride it.
No-name shudders slightly at the mention of the train: I’ll ride it. Pulse?
Caller: Discretionary, of course proof is required, though. Saved your hardest for last. Annette Glory, pulse mandatory, Location only broadly known as the tri-state area, last known was Dodge City back in April, but reports have been popping up all over. We’re hopin you can narrow her down on your way—you can feel free to bring her in any time, just be careful, we don’t have any read on her AUG level at this point. And remember; you can’t miss that window on Kurtz. 
No-Name: Where do I bring Glory?
Caller: Oh right, Agency facilities only.
No-Name: Not a problem
With that she turns her arm over and the screen shuts off. She mounts her horse and rides out of town toward her first target.
Cut to an unnamed saloon near Eldorado where we see Tyrell Bell handily defeating a group of un-armed assailants. In order to have any group upgrade, a person must first undergo overall upgrade as indicated by their AUG level, AUG levels reflect overall strength and power, while group enhancements offer exponential, although temporary, boosts to specific groups. Bell isn’t using his enhanced legs, despite fighting six people. It is clear they’re no match for him and the damage they can inflict with their hands is inconsequential. In a move of desperation we see one of the attackers make his way from the scuffle and lunge for the gun on his belt hanging on the wall and fire at Bell; he misses all but one shot, a glancing blow on his shoulder. The bar stops as Bell smiles at the shooter. We see his finger touch a small button and a power meter light up all seven bars green. We only see the movement around the bar and then Bell standing over his now victim, his foot through his chest.

Bell: And all I wanted was a fair fight. Someone come over here’n clean this mess up.
Bell casually shakes the blood off his leg.
Bell: And draw me a bath with some company.
It’s clear by the reactions of the other patrons that they have no more appetite for this behavior, but there is nothing to be done—Bell’s enhancements, even though they’re slight, have rendered him far beyond what normal people can defeat. He walks to the bar leaving a trail of bloody footprints as we see the power bar on his legs power down. Before he gets to the bar 
Bell: What’s it gonna take to get a pitcher round here?
The bartender is filling a fresh pitcher before the end of the sentence as Bell saunters up to him, devouring the horrified gazes from the crowd that keep alternating between him and the pile of man-soup he left on the floor. 
Bartender: Agnes, go grab the girls and the hose and some mops… Here ya go Mr. Bell.
His tone is even, calm, although it’s clear he’s playing the role. This isn’t the first time he’s seen Bell act up, and he was certain it wouldn’t be the last. Bell starts chugging straight from the pitcher, pouring all over himself as he does.
The doors open gently, and we see No-Name standing in the entryway, the light shining bright from behind her. Upon sight Bell chokes and drops his pitcher, coughing and gagging as he chokes out one word
                            FUCK! 
We see No-Name lock her eyes on him and verify against her image that he’s her target. With a click we see Bell hit his legs and burst to disappear, but he’s stopped dead in his tracks before he gets to the window. We see No-Name holding him on the ground, having tackled him. It’s clear that she never activated an enhancement.
No-Name, addressing the crowd: Im here acting on orders from the Government, This man is Tyrell Bell and he is wanted for Slave-Trading, among other crimes. (now addressing Bell) Unfortunately for you, your justice was left to me. 
We’re left unsure of what’s happening as the camera cuts to their faces (shot reverse shot), but we hear pain and gurgling noises from Bell as blood pours out of his mouth. The two stare in a kind of embrace, Bells eyes in horror and No-Names almost a look of love; if not, lust. He groans in pain as he see No-Names upper body flex, still obscuring her exact motions/actions. Closeup; we see her smile as Bell closes his eyes.

The camera stands up before No-Name, and we hear a sickening crunching, ripping sound, alongside his final, most unsettling scream, as she stands up we see that she has ripped Bells head off with her hands. No power-up groups have been activated or de-activated
No-Name stands up and addresses the bartender: Add that to their clean-up list.
She isn’t malicious in how she says it, a kind of sympathetic nonchalance in her voice.
No-name: Ive got a couple of questions for you.
Bartender: of course. Least I can do for taking care-a Bell like that; that monsters been torturing me for over…
No-Name cuts him off: I didn’t do it for you. I got word about a woman came through here a while back by the name of Annette Glory. You know her?
Again, no malice, but a sincerely threatening tone drips through her words. 
Bartender: Well I reckon I know the name, but I-onno know the woman. I heard the implants she got made her psychic or somethin, made her so she kint be caught.
No-Name: You don’t worry about my job. 
A shattering iciness resonates through the room. Nobody’s moved since the mercenary stood up, everyone waiting with bated breath to see her next move, praying not to be on her list.
Bartender: (nervous) Oh ‘a’course not, ma’am, I’s just trynna helps all, but… I reckon yer right bout not needin mine. I heard she was headed east, that she was gonna go disappear in the Ozarks. Gods know I’d never go chasing Madam Glory through any kinda woods.
No-Name does her best to hide her disgust, but it clearly shines through as the bartender continues stammering on.
No-Name, cutting the bartender off: What about the Dorsey gang?
Bartender: What about ‘em?
No-Name: I heard they were holed up north of Emporia.
Bartender: (his nerves have calmed a little as he’s poured two shots of his finest bourbon and offered one to No-Name) Cheers
Their eyes meet before they down the shot together.
Bartender: Ya what’s lefta ‘em I reckon, I heard it was a bloodbath on that train, though.
No-Name: Any chance they sent that word out on their own? Set a trap for me?
Bartender: (dumbstruck) I’d nevera thoughta that, to be honest witcha. 
No-Name appraises him, a heap of bone and meat, organic, un-enhanced.
“NON THREAT” flashes under her “cyborg vision” of the appraisal
No-Name: No, I reckon you wouldn’t have. You know exactly where their hideout is?
Bartender: I kint say for certain they’ll be there now, but word is there’s a place they stay on the Neosha River, a few miles northwesta ‘Mporia. Got a hidden place tucked away in some woods.
No-Name: How many in the gang before the train?
Bartender: Ohh… at leasta dozen or so I reckon. They say just two-a ‘em made it out alive. Say they still got shot. Musta had some kinda them enhancements.
No-Name: (threateningly) Nothing like that’s been reported to me. Tell me what you know.
Bartender: (the fear back in his voice) oh I don’t know nothin’, I’s just guessin is all, to survive getting shots as many times as they say they did. Reckon you gotta have sunt-in to help holdja together make it through that.
No-Name, relaxing: I reckon you’d be right about that. You got a room and a stable?
Bartender: A Course I do, for you, I’ll put you up in the best room, free-a charge o’course!
No-Name: I thank ya for it. 
Camera cuts to No-Name in her room, she sets down Bell’s head on the dresser and takes her hat and gloves and boots off and we finally get a look at her different enhancement groups and the power-up bars associated with each; where Bell had one power bar on his right leg, No-name has four on each, each with a more streamlined feel (think led, blue power bars vs a multi color gauge) than bells. Not just on her hips, she has a set of bars for each knee, too. Her arms at the shoulders and on her wrists, and one, larger than the rest, on her chest. We see as she undresses, revealing no armor, only clothes. This world poses no threat to her.
She fishes a dollar coin out of her pocket and places it on the nightstand and goes to the bathroom where she draws a bath to clean the blood off her body. The water doesn’t have any effect on this technology. She undresses and gets into the bath, 
No-Name: Call Jackson
Her vectro-graph screen beams above her and we see the call waiting screen before the caller from who assigned the mission answers. This time we see his face in its entirety in the image.
Jackson: Good evening agent, I see you’re doing well.
No-Name: Bell is taken care of. Wasn’t a problem here, but I can’t stop feeling like there’s a trap set up ahead.
Jackson: Don’t worry about it, even if there is, just do your best to keep as many alive as possible and bring em straight in when you got em. Any word on Glory?
A knock on the door and a maid gently opens the door, wheeling a cart carrying a small banquet on top and freshly cleaned and warmed linens underneath. The cart has heated trays emitting fire, though we have no clear indication of the fuel source. Her face is obscured in the hood of her outfit and we see her scarred hands as she works, hands that have seen much harder work, hands holding the weight of years of pain; riddled with arthritis but still strong, fighting against times best efforts to weaken, unfortunately she’s on the losing side of that battle now.
Maid: Sorry to interrupt, ma’am. Would you like the food with you or in the room?
Her voice is sure and calm.
No-Name: Oh, I’ll take it here, thank ye.
Maid: (wheeling the cart silently to the bath, camera cuts and shows No-Name in her bath, facing away from the maid,) Will there be anything else? 
No-Name, slightly turns but not quite facing the maid: No, thank ye. Take the dollar off my nightstand, I left it for you. 
The maid thanks her and takes the dollar as she disappears out of the room and No-Name Searches the small buffet, coming out with a massive turkey leg. She takes a bite.
No-Name, addressing Jackson: Not much, said she was going to the Ozarks, and the bartender seemed awfully frightened of her, said she had psychic powers.
Jackson: Like we said before, we got no word on her augmentations. Unfortunately, it seems you’ll have to get that information on your own for the time being. If she’s headed to the Ozarks, though, you should speak to Guymon over in Springfield. I’ll give him word to keep’n ear out.
No-Name: I can’t say I like how little information we got on Glory. *Bite*
Jackson: I know, I’m sorry—you got your ampho-shots?
No-Name: Two
Jackson: Shouldn’t have to worry too much, then. The good news is we do have solid word on Lejeune and Weston being alone, authorities counted ten bodies, found one still breathin. Did you get their location?
No-Name studies her turkey leg and sets it down, grabs a pint of beer and downs it in one clean gulp before picking the leg back up.
No-Name: Yeah, the bartender said they had a hideout northwest of emporia. I’ll go scope it out in the morning after I drop Bell’s head off. 
Jackson: You know, you can bring the whole body in for proof.
No-Name: Too much to carry. *bites*
Jackson breaks into a laugh on his end. She’s serious, but the brutality forces a genuine chuckle from Jackson.
Jackson: Well report in when you’re finished, and don’t forget—you cant miss Kurtz. We’ll have an exact window for you next time we speak.
No-Name: Understood. 
The call screen goes blank and No-Name finishes eating her food. 
Cut to next morning (14th), Bells decaying face looking right at the camera as we hear No-Name talking to the Sheriff and the camera pans out to reveal they are at the Butler County Jail, the sheriff has distanced himself from the head No-Name placed on his desk.
Sheriff: Now we got one left alive outta the Dorsey gang, and Governor St John wants to see him hang with the last two, a macabre kinda “menage a trois” if you will. But please, be gentler than you were with poor Mr. Bell here.
No-Name: I can’t make any promises.
We can tell this agitates the sheriff, but he doesn’t want to press the issue further.
Sheriff: Well… I trust you’ll do your best. 
No-Name: Tell me what you know about Annette Glory.
Sheriff: I know she’s not to be trifled with, but clearly neither are you. They say she can talk to animals and turn herself into one. Say she can even be an eagle and fly.
No-Name: No more psychic powers then?
The sheriff has a puzzled look on his face: Psychic?
No-Name: I guess some people say she can read minds and such. Psychic, that’s what they call it, but no one, not even at AUG 4 has ever really proved they had it. They say the aliens do, though.
A chill shudders down the sheriffs back at the mention of the aliens.
Sheriff: I sure believe that. I’ve never met an AUG 4…
No-Name’s icy look cuts him off before he utters another syllable.
Sheriff: but… uh… do you know when you might be bringin them boys in?
No-Name: I’m headed their way as soon as I leave here.
Sheriff: Well just be sure to bring ‘em in alive. Lyon County Sheriff’ll be happy to have ‘em, I’m sure.
No-Name gives him a nod and walks out of the room. We linger on The sheriff, who despite having physically towered over the bounty hunter, collapses into a tiny heap in his chair and sighs in exasperation and relief as soon as the doors shut.
Cut to No-Name riding her horse in the sun, “better living thru chemistry” by QOTSA plays over a series of camera pans through beautiful vistas. We get a clear view of some of the potential her horse has with its enhancements, passing others on horseback at breakneck speed and easily overtaking a train and climbing insurmountable terrain with seemingly endless endurance. What would have been a two-day trip she can make in an hour on her horse. 
She slows as she nears a bit of forested area about a kilometer from the river, and we see from her POV as she scans the area, revealing an inordinate amount of foot traffic into an entrance obscured by brush. She starts in that direction on her horse, dismounting when she gets close to the entrance and sending her away. She walks into the woods and we hear the chorus of nature. A few steps in and we hear a rustling from behind, No-Name turns instantly to scan but is ambushed. She was expecting this, but this is only one attacker.
The attacker is small and fast, but deceptively strong; their face obscured by a mask. For the first time we see a color other than green on No-Names screen, a blue outline around her opponent, AUG 4 underneath. No-Name is unperturbed and strikes quickly, both not using any enhancement group. The attacker swings violently, though it seems less aggressive and more purposeful, as though they’re going to subdue and not to kill. No-Name doesn’t have the same ethics though and we see her cross her wrists together and swords pup up and out of her forearms. She starts to swing faster than we can see, but she’s frustrated as nothing lands and the camera cuts to slow motion—we see her attacker effortlessly dodging her attacks before reaching to her back and pulling out a small bar that expands into a 7 foot spear. The two battle to a standstill for a moment until No-Name gets the better of her attacker for a moment, nearly revealing their face. We hear the power-up sound associated with group enhancements and the attacker sends a punch into No-Names chest, staggering her long enough for the attacker to escape.
Temporarily exhausted and out of breath, she takes a moment to gather herself. Clearly, he wasn’t a lookout for these two poor souls, he took off the wrong direction, unless his friends keep bad company. After taking a moment to consider her options, whether to continue to her target or pursue her attacker, she addresses herself.
No-Name: You’ll be back.
And with that she steadies herself and moves deeper into the woods. We see her hunt through slowly and carefully, avoiding a couple of poorly setup traps on the way. As she gets nearer, we hear voices and she crouches down to scan. Her scan reveals both her targets, revealing Lejeune to have some enhancements, though not an AUG 1 yet.
Weston: Sshh, I thought I heard somethin.
Lejeune: Well maybe we oughta get caught, Iunno how much longer I kin hold on without help.
Weston: You idiot! you know they’re gonna hang us if they catch us.
The camera cuts back to the bush where the mercenary had crouched, and we see her stand up.
No-Name: Well when you’re right you’re right.
And with that we see her immediately close the gap between her and her prey and drop them with one violent strike each, the easiest fight so far. Clearly unsatisfied she pulls out her rope and hogties them both together before effortlessly slinging the pair over her shoulder. As she walks out, we see her pause, clearly looking uneasy as she scans around, the feeling she’s being watched is palpable. The camera cuts away to a beautiful twilight vista
We watch her ride to Emporia to the Sheriff station where she drops the two remainders from the Dorsey Gang.
Deputy: Ah the sheriff’ll be right thrilled when’n’he gits back
The deputy’s excitement doing its best to mask his terror of being in the bounty-hunter’s presence.
No-Name: You know who I work for?
Deputy, the terror has taken over: uhh… ye… yes ma’am. 
No-Name: Good. Send the payment there and do it by the end of the day. 
Deputy: ‘a’course, ma’am, I’ll do it right now
No-Name nods and turns to go. As she gets to her horse, we see her pause and stop. She turns around (camera shifts to her POV) and we see her scan the rooftops. We glimpse a blue silhouette of a person moving quickly to get out of view, No-Name pulls her revolver and fires a single shot that hits the chimney the stalker ducks behind, leaving a crater much larger than any pistol should be capable of, before disappearing completely.
No-Name, shouting: Why don’t you come back and fight me again in the open, coward!?
But the shouting is pointless, he’s already gone. No-Name scans the horizon again before mounting her horse. It’s almost sunset and we follow No-Name as she makes her way to an inn. 
 When she enters the camera shifts to her POV and we see her make a scan of all the patrons of the bar; one person, an older Hispanic man sitting alone at a table with a small group of people behind him fawning over him, stands out with a slight yellow tinge around his body, the scan reads AUG 2. As she walks over to the bar, the camera shifts to his POV, and we still see No-Name outlined in dark read, AUG 4 flashing menacingly on the screen.
The patron is unfrightened, or at least acts as such, and shouts over the crowd with his accent.
Raul: Hey there, friendo! Why don’t you join me at my table? Food and drinks on me!
His tone is sincere and friendly, eager for new company, he literally shoos the adoring crowd away like pests as No-Name approaches the table.
Raul: It’d be nice to have some real company for once!
No-Name, sitting down: So, what’s your name?
Raul: Raul! Raul Julia at your pleasure, I own this fine establishment. And may I ask who I have the pleasure of speaking with, Miss…?
No-Name: No, you can’t. I’ll take it you know me, though. Do you know Annette Glory?
Raul: I know the name and the rumors. Have you found her?
No-Name: Hm. I heard she was going to the Ozarks; you heard anything like that?
Raul: Well I hadn’t heard anything like that, but it makes sense with her being able to talk to trees and what-not.
No-Name: That’s a new one; I heard she was psychic.
Raul: Oh, that, too! I know one thing, if there’s a wooded area and Madam Glory is in it, you couldn’t pay me enough to go in. They say she can talk to the trees with her mind and they tell her where everyone is, help her catch her prey.
No-Name: Psychic is one thing; psychic trees just Sounds a little… far-fetched.
Raul: Here we are, sitting with enhancements that make us so much more than human, you’ve got your ampho that makes you like a god, all this tech given to us by aliens, and talking to trees is too far-fetched?!? Dios Mio! They say the light tunnel is to be done before the turn of the century, and psychic trees is out of the line?!? (chuckles)
No-Name, slightly taken aback but still amused by the attitude: I see your point. I’ll keep that in mind. Have you got a room?
Raul: For you, any room. On the house. We have an open suite but if you prefer--
No-Name: The open suite is fine. Send dinner up in an hour. 
Raul: Of course. Go to the desk and say I sent you, ask for Suite 10.
Back in her room we get new, closer looks at different parts of her enhancement groups, painting a clear picture of how barely human No-Name is. Among her things we get a quick shot of her two ampho-shots, old style syringes popping out of her gun-belt, which is mysteriously and noticeably lacking any ammo. We get another survey of her scars, her back has no enhancements and we can see deep scars all across it. Her vectro-graph rings and she answers.
Jackson: Good work with those Dorsey gang boys. The governor is thrilled, says the execution is scheduled for tomorrow. He really wants to set a clear example with these boys so he’s gonna do it himself he says.
No-Name: Be a shame to miss it.
Jackson: You ain’t gotta! Word is that Kurtz is gonna be in Omaha for two days, one night, starting on the 16th, so you feel free to head on to Topeka and enjoy yourself a happy end to a job well done.
No-Name: I got attacked on my way to them boys. Someone scanned as AUG 4, saw ‘em again after I dropped the boys off. Nearly shot ‘em but he was too quick.
Jackson gives a concerned look: We don’t have any agents in the area; there shouldn’t be any AUG 4’s in the vicinity.
No-Name: Whoever it is, they’re clearly following me. I’ll see ‘em again.
Jackson: Well be sure to stay on the lookout and try to get to Omaha morning of the 16th, latest. Report back to me when you’re done with Kurtz.
No-Name: Yup.
And with that they both click off their devices, the camera lingers on No-Name for a moment before we cut to the next day, around 1:00 PM, Topeka, at the city square we see a bustling group of people, far more a diverse crowd and more people period than belong in 1880 Topeka. We are at a kind of open-air market full of different vendors with their carts and small pop-up shops, a kind of marriage of wild west and Europe/middle east markets with the advanced technology of the world on display. We see that small screens, much like cell phones but simply a flat screen instead and foldable, have proliferated and nearly everyone has them. Many people have wearable tech, including some that have eyepieces that allow for limited visual enhancement. There is a myriad of guns, on people and for sale, mainly revolvers and rifles, but no ammunition to be seen. Through No-Names POV we see that in the crowd of maybe three thousand, only a couple of people have reached AUG 1, and not a single shade other than green for outlines.
In the center of the town square we see a massive, elevated wooden stage with a series of gallows toward the back and three blindfolded prisoners being eschewed up the stairs at gunpoint by a squad of guards. The guards line the men up in the middle of the platform, noticeably well past the nooses, before taking their places behind. Two men follow, both well dressed, one of them, a man of average height with an impressive mustache that hangs down the sides of his mouth and reaches his collar, has been enhanced, including having a large cybernetic right hand. We see No-Names scan of them, a yellow outline with AUG 3 flashes around the enhanced man.
The larger of the two men, unenhanced, takes to the stage and sticks a small black dot to his neck, when he begins speaking his voice is amplified as if he’s speaking directly through a megaphone.
Humphrey: Good Afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Lieutenant Governor Lyman Humphrey, and this is the Honorable Governor John St John. 
Humphrey motions to John St John, standing proudly with his mustache rustling in the wind, and the crowd breaks into reverent applause, fervently clapping until St John gives them the calm motion with his bionic arm.
Humphrey: We are here today to witness the execution of the three remaining members of the infamous Dorsey Gang. Their crimes are numerous, ranging from petty theft to armed robbery, rape and even murder. The world will be a better place without ‘em. And without further ado, I’ll hand it on over to Governor St John.
We see the governor nod thanks at his lieutenant and begin to speak, although he doesn’t use a device his voice still projects like Humphrey’s did.
St John: As Lt Governor Humphrey said, these men are all vicious criminals; despicable, hardly even human. And as such, I am here today to carry out their executions. 
The Governor approaches the first man and squares himself in front of him.
St John: For the crimes of armed robbery and murder, by the power vested in me by the state of Kansas, I, Governor John St John, sentence you, Gunther Vale, to die.
And with that we see as St John quickly and violently launches his right arm forward to grab Vale’s neck, lifting him straight into the air with a locked arm. We see Vale shaking as St John’s grip starts to tighten, and we see that his hand continues to close, blood oozing between his fingers, crushing Vales neck like a soda can. After a few moments of struggling we hear the final sickening crack and watch as Vales head and body fall down separately. A wave of silent horror washes over the crowd as St John repeats the process two more times.
After surveying the carnage and gingerly stepping toward the front of the stage, St John Addresses the crowd again, his voice still projecting with some added bass.
St John: Let this be a warning to all those who would break our laws. Under NewLaw, crimes will be punished swiftly and severely. Keep your head about you, and you won’t lose it as these disgusting vermin did. Now, carry-on.
And with that the Governor and his Lt turn and leave the stage, quickly but not in a rush. After they’ve exited, we see another small group of soldiers enter the stage with cleaning supplies and body bags before we watch as No-Name, who has remained expressionless and unimpressed, leaves the area.
Again, we get a good glimpse of just how impressive her horse is with its enhancements as it makes the 160-mile trip to Omaha before dusk, the camera again watching her pass all manner of vehicle. We get our first glimpse of an aerial vehicle, which easily travels faster than No-Name, leaving a clear wave of exhaust behind it. It’s small, room for maybe ten, like a kind of private jet. It quietly rides low alongside No-Name before suddenly speeding up and ascending through the clouds.  
Twilight has fallen, the camera watches (high, from behind the sign, crane shot) as No-Name rides past the Omaha city limit sign and as it turns to follow her we see it bring daylight with it, transitioning us into the next day and a busy cosmopolitan city. No-Name is on foot now and she enters the market.
She heads into a gun store tucked deep in the alleys of the market.
Guymon: Kin I help ya?
She’s tall, close to six feet, her hands are rough, and her hair is a mess of black curls, freckles highlighting her deep green eyes and rosy cheeks. Guymon has a thick Midwest accent, removing and adding letters at will.
No-Name: Be honest, I’m not sure with you, but I do have some questions.
Guymon: ‘a’ course, ‘h’whatcha reck’nin’ ‘bout?
No-Name: Where Clinton Kurtz is staying the night. I know he’ll be here tonight, and I’d like to meet him.
Guymon shifts, uncomfortable but compliant
Guymon: Yeah, I heard he got hisself a room o’er at that new-style hotel got put up o’er where Herndon House useta be. I thought the railroad bought it up, but after ’75 I guess they changed their plans.
No-Name: Right. You heard about any AUG 4’s in the area?
Guymon: O’her’n’that there’s one headed here like her mare ain’t got but one speed? Nah I can’t say’s I have.
No-Name: You ever hear of Annette Glory?
Guymon: ‘Course, can’t say I know anything ‘cept that they say she kin fly, say she kint be killed, either.
No-Name: Good thing I have to bring her in alive, then. 
Guymon chuckles: I guess so. You gotcha a place to stay I reckon?
No-Name: Would you know an AUG 4 on sight?
Guymon: ‘a’course I would. Ain’t too many-a-ya that exist.
No-Name: Right. Let me know if you hear anything.
No-Name exits the store and enters the market, wandering around the squares, interrogating different people. Nightfall and we see her watching a hotel from a rooftop across the way, crouched on the ledge.
Kurtz leaves the hotel and we see her zero in on him. He scans as AUG 3, a light yellow outline around his body. He has a squad of guards with him, all of them at least partially augmented, about half of them scan AUG 2. 
No-Name studies the gang carefully, watching and following along the rooftops as they head to the train yard on foot. As they walk everyone clears out of their way
They arrive at the train-yard and members of the guard fan out as Kurtz meets a man standing with his own group of guards. The pair stand in front of a train car and Kurtz opens the door, briefly surveys inside and shuts it.
Kurtz has a thick, poorly faked accent that doesn’t particularly belong to any one dialect.
Kurtz: And you got three more fulla N_____’s like this, eh?
Businessman: That’s right. You have the payment?
Kurtz turns on his Vectro-Graph and a hologram of a bank ledger pops up. He uses his finger to write 500,000 in the debit column.
Kurtz: To the dollar, guvnor.
With that the other group turns and leaves and Kurtz begins barking orders at his men. No-Name drops from the roof and begins walking to the group, slowly and carefully. They’re working, all of them are visible. No-Name surveys the situation a moment before deciding to act.
N.N, Shouting: Clinton Kurtz! I’m here on the authority of The Agency and have been sent here to issue your sentence. If you surrender now, I’ll bring you in alive.
The men all turn to face her as she speaks and begin fanning out in a kind of staggered column reaching out between her and Kurtz, aiming various weaponry in her direction.
Camera cuts to Kurtz’s POV and he scans her, the menacing AUG 4 still flashing below her red outline.
Kurtz: Well I only see one of you, you n_____ bitch. I’d like to see you try.
N.N: Okay.
No-Name crosses her wrists, her blades extend and she takes a step toward the column, but when her foot lands we see the blade on her left arm is soaked in blood, and the nearest of Kurtz’s goons collapses dead. The guards begin firing but it’s completely futile-- with each footstep closer we see the gore on her increase and the next guard die. 
Kurtz has panicked, his confidence has fled as he repeatedly shouts that she’s just a dumb n_____ bitch. He retreats back to a briefcase and we see him grab two syringes, one with a lightning bolt on the side the other with skull and crossbones. He injects the Ampho and joins the battle, rushing in so fast we lose sight of him, though we do see the poison show up next to one of the AUG 2 guards.
N.N reacts, ducking as Kurtz lunges at her and the camera cuts to slow motion. We watch as N.N Finally activates all of her enhancement groups, sending her into a blinding fury to match Kurtz. The two fight for a moment before we see the AUG 2 guard sneak up from behind and jam the syringe into No-Names back, instantly incapacitating her.
Kurtz: See, toldja you’s just a dumb n____ bitch. (addressing the remaining few guards, about 1/3 survived) Load it up on Eichmann’s car to see if he can get some’a them enhancements out before we dump it off. I’ll check on her when we get moving.
And with that the camera slowly pans away from overhead as we see Kurtz board the train and his goons load No-Name onto one of the cars.

Cut to No-Name’s POV. She’s naked in a room that takes up nearly a half the train car, tied to a surgical table, and we see her check and pull against her bonds before it registers that she doesn’t have her HUD anymore. She starts to breathe in a panicked way, the first time we’ve seen her seem the slightest bit nervous before we hear the door to the car open.
Eichmann: Oh! I see you’re awake! Good!
Eichmann’s voice is erudite and charming, nearly unpleasant in its pleasantness, he walks around the room as he speaks, opens a counter, appraises No-Name as he monologues.
Eichmann: Struggling will be quite useless, and I’m not surprised you weren’t prepared! I’ve only just developed it, the serum that renders enhancements unusable for a time. Should be a couple days. Unfortunately, especially for you, the only way to truly remove an enhancement is… well. Removal. And that’s where I come in!
N.N. steadies her breath, nervous but refusing to panic.

Eichmann: And, with how deeply these are all embedded, I’m afraid it’s an extraordinarily invasive procedure! Honestly, we’re not even sure if you’ll survive, but I guess that’s a risk they’re willing to take! Ha!

Eichmann gives a genuine and unnervingly charming smile as he goes to his workbench to get his tools.

Eichmann: This is going to hurt.

This is clearly an understatement as, though Eichmann is smiling as he gets to work removing the enhancements from her leg. He starts with what appears to be a drill; a whir, a scream, and we see N.N writhe in pain and scream through her gag as Eichmann works.",stories,A CyberPunk reimagining of the wild west,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lnjogy/a_cyberpunk_reimagining_of_the_wild_west/,1613722649.0

151,DB_Cooper_is_alive,1613749262,"So I was just smoking weed with two other friends last night and my friend has an Asian couple for room mates. We were chatting outside when we heard the Asian girl screaming super loudly and got startled. We went into the house to investigate, and the girl kept screaming, and then we heard repeated hard slapping noises. But the door was closed so we couldn't actually see anything. My friend started to record video at this point but you can only here the woman screaming because the door was closed. We knocked on the door and asked them to come out and talk to us. The guy came out and kept saying ""I didn't touch her"". We told the guy that we wanted to talk to the girl and see if everything was alright, so he went in, whispered something to her and sent her out. When we asked the girl if she was okay, she didn't want to talk to us. Then my friend called the landlord, who instructed him to call 911 if the screaming persisted. We told the couple that we would call 911 if we heard any more screaming and then they were quiet for the rest of the night.

My friend is kind of concerned for her because they are moving to an independent house next month and he thinks the guy might just lock her up in the basement and abuse her everyday and no one would ever know. He told us that this was a regular occurrence and that in the past, he had heard the Asian guy yelling ""I'm gonna kill you"" and stuff.

Just bad vibes all over man. Not sure if we could have handled the situation better or if we can do anything moving forward.

No reply. He walks up to it and to his surprise; Jack raised his hand in the air and gave him the middle finger, whilst having his tongue out and a mocking and childish expression on his face.

On the other hand. Sean glared a confused expression his face. -""What?""- ""What the fuck?""

""What the fuck is wrong with these two"" He can hear their voices through the phone; taunting and mocking him as they continued their escapade. 

He hangs up the phone, but they continued to taunt. He slightly raises his hand and flips them the middle finger whilst slowing shaking his head.

And when he came downstairs to his surprise, Saori had fallen asleep on the sofa, her head peacefully resting against a pillow, her cute face falls into deep slumber, Seán smiles in awe, he gently shook her to wake up, she grunts; she doesn't want to be disturbed. Seán takes a step back ""Wow...She really is a deep sleeper"" he though ""Jack wasn't kidding"". He giggles to himself ""This is really cute"" Seán smiles in awe contently again. Saori had the left the television on; playing some sort of anime series. ""Seems a bit cliché, but hey who am I going to judge"" he thought.

Saori shivers a bit; she's cold. Seán went upstairs to grab a blanket for Saori, the soles of his shoes creak the wooden floor, Seán stopped a bit, he slowly walks to his bedroom, as to not disturb Saori. He slowly slid open his bedroom closet; just some clothes hanging. Sean scowers through, eventually he found one. A folded sheet of warm cotton blanket, he pace fully walks down the stairs, carefully not making a creak on the floor.

Sean unfolds the sheet and covers Saori from her feet and up to her neck, she grunts; the warmth of the blanket hovers over Saori, keeping her body temperature at a normal state, she won't be shivering from the cold later tonight.

Sean shuts the T.V off, and heads up to his room, he shuts off the lights and slowly walks the up the stairs.

He took off his shoes and fell in to the bed, he sighed, he closed his eyes and called it a night.

154,Kayeaaa,1613740499,"I was 5 years old.

I was at school, and the teacher (young, maybe late 20s, blonde, female, pretty) had the whole class sit on the floor because she wanted to make an announcement.

She said that a glue stick was missing a lid, and she couldn’t find it. So she wanted all the students in the class to go around the classroom and find the lid.

After making that announcement, she said “now go!!”. As soon as she said that, every single student stood up (because we were all originally sitting on the floor) and scattered around the classroom trying to find the glue stick lid.

But me, as a 5 year old, did not stand up. As soon as the teacher said “now go!!!”, instead of standing up, I stayed where I was sitting, and immediately decided to find the glue stick lid by crouching down and scanning the floor of the classroom.

I remember precisely that I scanned the floor of the classroom for about 3 seconds, and immediately saw a glue stick lid underneath a cabinet that had wheels. As soon as i saw the glue stick lid, I walked quickly towards it to retrieve it, and then walked as quick as possible back to the teacher and gave it to her.

So, it took me less than 10 seconds to retrieve the glue stick lid and give it back to the teacher.

Instead of the teacher saying thank you, the teacher and another student (I still remember the student’s name) that was standing next to the teacher said:

The student said “she stole it, she had it the whole time”, and the teacher said “I know”. 

At 5 years old, I was a kind-hearted kid who wanted to help everyone, and didn’t want anyone to feel hurt.

After hearing the teacher believe that I was stealing, I still didn’t approach the teacher saying that I didn’t steal. This is because at 5 years old, I know how much it can hurt someone’s ego to find out they are wrong. So i never told the teacher that I didn’t steal it, and I never told the teacher how I managed to find the glue stick in such a short amount of time (in 10 seconds).

I know this story is just about a glue stick. But it is deeply traumatising to me because I was trying to be a helpful kid, but was accused of stealing by my teacher. At 5 years old, I looked up to my teacher as an authority figure. So to see your “role model” accuse you of something is so deeply hurtful.

Im trying to let this story go, but it is so hard to let it go.

I’m now in my early 20s. And Im trying to understand the story from my teacher’s perspective. My teacher probably thought it would have taken much longer to find the glue stick lid, so she thought that there was no way I could have found that lid in such a short amount of time. Which is why she thought I was stealing.

If I could go back in time, I would have walked up to the teacher and said I didn’t steal. And I would have explained to her how I was able to find the glue stick in 10 seconds. But somehow, I think the teacher would still not have believed me because her ego was too high.",stories,"This story deeply hurt me and it happened when I was 5 years old.

158,MasteerTwentyOneYT,1613712347,"Billions of years after the great galactic empires peaked and science was finished, the stars began to die, and no new ones were made.

And, somewhere in a remote patch of space, a bear came upon a goose.

‎

""Hello,"" Bear said, ""do we know each other?""

""I don't think so,"" Goose said.

""Well, which civilization do you come from?""

""I don't remember what they're called,"" Goose said, ""I think they had a few wars and watched TV every now and then, I guess""

""Yeah,"" Bear said, ""that sounds like my civilization, too. Is yours gone as well?""

""Well, they're all gone,"" Goose said, ""we're the last ones left, don't you know?""

Bear looked out at the universe and knew Goose was right. All the nebulas were coming apart. All the galaxies were withering.

""How long do we have?"" Bear asked.

""Oh, not long,"" Goose replied, ""Very soon now, the universe will collapse back in on itself""

""Huh,"" Bear said, ""What happens then?""

""Oh, everything will be gone,"" Goose said, ""No more walking, no more swimming, and no more fun. So it goes.""

""Huh,"" Bear said again, ""What was your civilization like?""

""Hmm,"" Goose said. She pointed with her wing

""You see that star? My whole civilization began there. And that galaxy? They spread through the whole thing. Made music, wrote books, married, divorced, lived, died, had wars, apologized, had wars, nuked everything. A billion years of Empire, millions of languages, thousands of planets, and now... all gone""

""All gone..."" Bear echoed.

""And how about yours?"" Goose said.

""Well, my civilization discovered the workings of nature, knew how it was all put together, saw the logic in the chaos, built enormous Starships, traded with thousands of other empires, travelled the entire cosmos, learned everything there was to learn, then came right back to where they started. They saw everything, then gave up.""

""Pity,"" Goose said, ""Anyway, the end will be here soon. It's been lovely chatting""

Goose closed her eyes and was silent. Bear looked out again at the dying universe and felt very sad.

""What was it all for?"" he said finally.

""What?"" Goose said.

""What was the point?""

""Oh, what's the point in anything!"" Goose said. She closed her eyes again

An idea came to Bear: ""We know everything,"" Bear said, ""Everything our civilizations knew.""

""Sure,"" Goose said.

""And we can do anything; We're all powerful.""

""Well, within limits.""

""Well, Why don't we remake the universe?""

""Well that's impossible. We couldn't survive the collapse. It's very close now; just over there."" Goose said, and pointed with her wing.

""Well then, we'll set the next universe up properly for whoever comes after.""

Goose opened her eyes. ""Like how?""

""Well, I don't know. Make it more interesting. Change the rules a bit. Come on, they'll never know. It'll be fun!""

Goose considered this idea; she was very clever after all. Under different circumstances, she might have gone on TV talking about astrophysical matters.

Neil DeGoose Tyson, perhaps.

""All right,"" Goose said, ""I'm listening.""

""Well,"" Bear said, ""let's make everything based on subatomic particles this time. We'll call them...""

""Quacks!"" Goose said.

""A bit silly. How about Quarks?""

""Fair compromise,"" Goose said.

Bear began setting up the new universe.

""And we'll make olives taste nice this time!""

""Okay, Good idea,""

""And fruit will grow on trees,""

""Sounds good,""

""And every now and then, after a good meal, people will throw up a bit in their own mouths!""

""What?"" Goose said, ""Why?""

""I don't know, it'll be funny.""

""Don't put that in,"" Goose said.

Bear put it in.

Then he organized physics, chemistry, and biology, and made them all interact. He built in emerging properties, invented quantum field theory. He debugged everything, and then he added some DLC.

He made water wet, deserts dry, and Tom Hanks impossible to dislike. And then, finally, he was done.

They marvelled at the starting conditions for their new universe.

""It's still missing something,"" Bear said, ""Should we add more purple?""

""No, it doesn't need more purple,"" Goose said.

""Hey, maybe coffee should make everyone shit real bad.""

""Don't put that in,"" Goose said

Bear put it in.

""There!"" he exclaimed, ""Perfect, let's get this sucker going.""

""No, wait,"" Goose said, ""We're still missing something.""

""We've got to make things... difficult.""

""Difficult?"" Bear said, ""No. We'll make this the party cosmos! Margaritas on trees, walking hamburgers, that kind of thing.""

""No,"" Goose said, ""Look where that got our civilizations. Everything was boring; it was too easy""

""We'll make living tricky, but not too tricky. That way there'll be a point. At least for a while.""

""We'll make the stars so far away, they'd have to get clever to reach them.""

""We'll make nature just weird enough to be interesting, but not so weird they give up.""

""And we can't put the meaning of life in plain sight; it'll have to be a challenge.""

""They'll need to fall in love or go backpacking or argue in the comments section of Reddit or something""

""All right,"" Bear said and made the changes.

They sat back then and admired their blueprint of the cosmos, soon-to-be. No one could doubt that it was, indeed, very pretty.

Around them, the stars were going out in bunches now, and the light was dying; The Singularity was reclaiming its territory.

""Is this it?"" Bear said.

""This is it,"" Goose replied.

""What will happen to us now?""

""Oh, we'll be gone. Everything will be gone. And then, the new universe will start. Just how we designed it.""

The darkness came down in silent curtains all around them. History was dying. Space gave a little whimper. The end was just moments away.

""Goose, I'm scared,"" Bear said

""I know, Bear,"" Goose said, ""But it won't hurt. Here, put my wing in your paw, and don't let go.""

As they held onto each other, the last star finally died. Then, space began to collapse into a point infinitely small, the laws of physics melting down and blurring into each other.

Time and space falling undone. Billions of years had come to this, and, soon, it would be for nothing at all.

‎

""Will they see?"" Bear said, ""In the next cycle, do you think they'll see how beautiful everything is?""

""Sometimes,"" Goose said, ""Only sometimes. All the time would be too much. Never would be too little.""

""Every now and then. They'll see it sometimes.""

""And that will be..."" she paused.

""Enough.""",stories,Bear and Goose at the end of everything.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ln7sim/bear_and_goose_at_the_end_of_everything/,1613683547.0
159,jbuchana,1613711585,"This happened around 1982

I knew that it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience when the customer told me that the set had to be fixed before the big game that night. Sure, it might be, but if the problem was what it sounded like, we'd have to order parts -if it was decided that this old TV was worth it.

Soon I had the set apart and had confirmed that it needed a new flyback transformer. I knew I didn't have one in the truck, I doubted that I had one at the shop, and I was sure that I would junk this old set before putting that much money into it.

I climbed out from behind the set and found myself looking down the barrel of a very old pistol. The owner of the TV had it aimed right at my face. He pulled the trigger. Click. It was not loaded. He started laughing about how he had scared me.

Then he loaded it and aimed it at me again. He then lowered it and started laughing, and unloaded it, while asking about the TV. I was pretty careful about what I said. He started rambling about the honesty of TV service technicians and how he thought a TV service call should go, and how much the charge should be, all the while loading and unloading the gun, spinning the cylinder, playing with it, dry firing it, and telling me how it was his grandfather's.

I was thinking pretty fast, and made up a story about how simple the problem was, and I'd just run out to the truck and get the part. My plan was to hop in and drive off, leaving the tools behind. It seemed a good plan, and it worked perfectly.

I drove back to the shop and was telling my co-workers about it when my boss walked in. He heard part of the story, and would not listen to the rest. He made the assumption (I had not worked at that shop very long) that I was some gun-hating liberal (more leftist than liberal, and not gun-hating), and that I had gotten scared at the very sight of a gun. In reality, I had several at the time. I just hate having them pointed at me...

In any case, he would not listen, and went out to complete the service call. He said that we'd have a real discussion when he got back.

When he had not come back in a reasonable time, we called the police. They did not take the situation too seriously. Somehow when it was mentioned that he had not come back to the shop or gone home in time for dinner, they latched on to the possibility that it was a domestic dispute. They just did not get it. His wife called to try to convince them that he was not avoiding her, but that he might be in trouble. They told her to wait twenty-four hours and file a missing person's report. I have since learned that this often-repeated 24-hour wait is not a thing, but they did not want to do anything and made that quite clear. This was one of the first experiences that taught me how useless the police can be when you really need help.

Well, the rest of the day passed, and no word. The next morning at work the service van was still gone and his car was still where he had parked it the day before. Then, while we were talking about the situation, he drove up in the service van. He got out. He looked awful. Quite disheveled, obviously no sleep.

He asked me to order replacement tools, and went home. He would not talk about what happened, and kept his silence for over 20 years. I have not seen him in almost another 20 years, and I suspect he’d still not want to talk about his experience.",stories,The Gun Collector,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ln7jyu/the_gun_collector/,1613682785.0

A billowing cape fluttered and flew at the behest of the storm. Lightning bolts cracked behind the golden drawbridge, answered by furiously howling gusts.

Luxiphos had his sword drawn, armor clasped firmly against his breast. His wife had expected a rival queen, one who could control the clouds and sky, to attack her fortress here on planet Amogdia.

But this newcomer was unexpected.

The guest's cloak was darker than the night sky, complimented by a mask that gave their mouth breathing room and windows to the world for their eyes.

Those damned eyes glared at him.

Wildfire irises encircled pupils, which were shaped much like the Cruvelian Galaxy on a map: three arms, a barred spiral, and a bulge at the center. To make matters worse, this cruel image was plastered on an eyeball as black as the person's cloak.

Blue irises met orange ones.

Luxiphos was unable to tear his eyes away from the enigmatic person, no matter how hard he tried. Not even a blink came from them, for they were standing with more stillness than boulders. 

""Who are you?"" Luxiphos asked the masked fighter, gripping his sword close to his breast. ""Who are you!""

""I thought you would know,"" the being spoke, carrying a voice of hard baritone and deep reverb, ""Nova Zudra knows me well…""

""But you live in the Galactic Center-""

A laugh interjected Luxiphos's sentence. ""I once lived there… and then the revolution came. So now, I travel Nova Zudra… or rather what remains of it.""

Luxiphos's teeth clenched, ""So you are part of the revolution! The one that overthrew Zudra! I know who you are!""

""Tsk, tsk, tsk… so angry, and we don't even know who the other is…""

""Stop your bullshit! We know what you came here to do! You want to help Helene conquer us! You fucking monster-""

""Anything for my dear sister…""

Luxiphos, drew his sword, stomping his feet into the ground. The masked one may be amused, but there were no fucks to give! ""Sister? Only by blood-you-"" The disguised one laughed at him. ""-you fool! You motherfucker- you!""

""Solares,"" Solares answered, raising their hand to shush the Lord of Men, ""my name is Solares.""

""You think you can claim that name! You're a traitor!""

""I believe I can. And you have so much anger for someone who does not know me."" Red flashed, blinding Luxiphos so much that he shrunk back, blocking his eyes from the light. ""And as far as I am concerned-'' Orange plasma bathed Solares's left palm, clenching into a hard fist that brought blood. ""-there is only one Solares, and he will not be obstructed by self righteous barbarians.""

Luxiphos staggered back, but Solares was stalking his every step, emitting enough spirit energy to make Luxiphos's chest overload with dread.  The plasma arranged into a sword, one for each hand, and was spilling sparks onto the grass. 

Some sparks dissipated, but others became fire. A ring of fire was surrounding Solares's very path, creating a pathway to the underworld as they walked.

Luxiphos swallowed.

""You think I am scared of you!"" he yelled at the walking Solares. ""Your powers do nothing to me! Helene is a coward, and she will lose! Even with your protection she will fall!""

""Oh, really?

""Yes!""

Solares chuckled, releasing a low grumble that made Luxiphos's belly drop to the pits. The beast in front of him raised both his swords, glancing at each with a bit of love. Most importantly, Solares looked hungry.

His next meal was Luxiphos. 

""So, we aren't going to have tea,"" Solares said as he lowered his swords, ""we are going to fight and kill each other.""

Luxiphos raised his own saber, which earned him a laugh.

""You laugh, but the funny part of it all is that… I don't even know who you are.""

Luxiphos yelled, refusing to fold. ""You don't know me, but I know what you came to do! You don't scare me, Solares! Your demise is coming!""

""War upon eye contact,"" Solares whispered, flaring energy from his body and soul, ""hatred on first sight.""

Someone screamed.

Metal and orange blades clashed, pushing for dominance. Fire pushed iron away, slashing the saber and jabbing forward.

In due time, Helene would come down from her skyward perch and join Solares in battle.

But for now, the tale of Amogdia would go down in history and culture as two things.

Luxiphos and Solares.

161,sing_Argent_Aria,1613705637,"This was such a boring existence. Wake up at the crack of dawn, hustle down to the cafeteria for a bland hash-brown and a weak cup of coffee, then spend the next nine hours making shoes for God knows who, all the while under the bloodshot eyes of “Joe”. At least, that’s the name we gave the warden. Rumor has it all the guards kept their real names a secret, even from each other. But believe you me, Joe didn’t take kindly to the lot of us in cellblock B. Meanest bastards you ever had the displeasure of meeting. Hate to say, but it felt more like home than the past few dumps I’d been crashing at. I didn’t exactly have time to make the most of my living situations. All you need to know is that when your past catches up to you, there’s no point trying to outrun it. Stupidly, I ran. I stumbled. I ended up here twelve years ago. But Joe didn’t care one way or another where you came from or how long you’d been here. When you found yourself locked up in B block, then your life was as good as over, even if you weren’t on death row. I wasn’t. But sadly, I wished I was. Beats the hell out of lacing shoes.

When the crackle of the intercom echoed across the warehouse, we all took pause to listen to Joe’s raspy baritone. It was enough to drive anyone insane, but you didn’t dare move or talk. And you sure as shit didn’t go back to what you were doing until Joe was done. Last guy who disrespected the warden got thrown in solitary for a month, but only after his “behavioral correction course”. Call it what you want, but a ruptured spleen and two broken ribs did the trick. Wasn’t much to say after that.

Joe’s words were always the same. The classic “miserable stains on society” and “irredeemable” remarks didn't really phase me too much, but Joe never failed to throw them in. I guess it made him feel tough, even though Joe didn’t show his face much anymore. Too old to get out and about. Hell, he was old when I got here, but he’d still stop by the cells once a month, if nothing more than to spit at your feet or kick your teeth in if he was in a particularly sour mood. That’s why the intercom was installed, so Joe could maintain his authority from a comfortable distance. That, and the prison didn’t have to spend “valuable assets” on reconstructive jaw surgery for the inmates.

Joe’s rambling went on for another fourteen minutes, but the monotony was broken with a statement nobody expected to hear:

“All occupants will be transported from B block to our new maximum security sector at 11:00 am tomorrow.”

Now it made sense why the guards were in a good mood all day long. B block was the oldest building on the lot. Built back in the 40’s, it originally held Japanese war prisoners. Not much attention was given to its upkeep the last few decades and it showed. Cracked walls, rusted pipes, mold and an influx of vermin. It was never meant to last, but I guess that’s what made it an ideal place for its current residents. Only the best for the “stains on society”. With the transport scheduled tomorrow, B block would most likely be demolished within a few weeks and these guards would get to move on to the new facility. An upgrade in lodging and amenities for them, but absolute hell for us. Transports were known for being unjustifiably rough. I’d seen a couple of guys moved into B block, and it was never a quiet affair. Blood and bruises usually came free of charge on the way here, so I could only imagine how it was going to play out when the worst of the worst got moved.

Despite Joe’s announcement, supper was unusually quiet. I anticipated more commotion about the transport, but just about everyone kept to themselves. There wasn’t even the weekly fight between Dimitri and Lars over who got the extra slice of chocolate cake. Stupid, sure, but always entertaining. Especially when a new guard had to come break it up. No, something just wasn’t right with these guys. The only other time it was ever so cool in the cafeteria was when Joe got involved with issues directly, only, that didn’t seem to be the case. A transport was fairly routine, even if it was an entire cell block, but I still couldn’t figure out what had everyone on edge. 

Most nights I just kept to myself, especially since I bussed tables after meals. I didn’t much care for the mess left behind, but the extra pack of smokes once a month made up for it. Just about the only thing worth looking forward to was a cigarette at the end of the day. Besides, recreation after supper was just a ploy by the guards to get you in worse trouble. Well, trouble worse than prison sentences. Joe’s influence certainly spread down through the ranks. The guards were supposed to be honest, just keep the peace, but they’d bet on fights and take bribes for drugs that “slipped” in to B block. Then they’d bring Joe in after seizing the contraband, some poor guy would get Joe’s special brand of inmate correction, and guards got promotions. Corruption all the way down.

All in all, another day come and gone. Back to the cells. My personal lodging wasn’t dark, quiet or remotely comfortable despite being a one bunk cell. I had a mattress and a dingy pillow to brag about for Christ’s sake, but even if I didn’t have these “luxuries”, I wasn’t counting on getting any sleep tonight. Why was everyone so off at supper? Were they worried about tomorrow? If Joe had really planned for such a significant transport, surely he’d have been there in person to flaunt it. And why, above all else, could I not let this feeling of uncertainty go? Maybe I should have skipped bussing tonight to get some information, but that didn’t matter now. Tomorrow would bring, for a change, something new.

I just didn’t think it would start with an explosion.

I couldn’t tell you if I heard it first or felt it. I don’t even know what time it happened. But what I do remember was falling onto my cold cement floor, wide awake in a strange combination of fear and intrigue. Then I saw it: an enormous section of the south wall, just beyond the cafeteria, completely demolished. The detritus was like something out of an old disaster movie. Chunks of concrete and shattered glass littered the lower atrium. Mangled iron rebar jutted out from what was still standing of the south wall, illuminated by a fierce orange glow. I couldn’t move, and I could barely process any thought beyond “What the hell just happened?”

The stridulous wail of an emergency siren combined with the manic shouting of the night-watch guards snapped me out of my stupor. Some were barking orders while others simply stared off into the fire. One guard was sprawled out on a cafeteria table, clutching at the deep red stain growing larger on his shirt while another was attempting CPR on an unconscious younger guard whose leg had been blown off.

It was absolute chaos and I was no more than a spectator. The rest of B block erupted into a cacophony of profanities, screams and yells. Whatever silence had been held in during supper was being made up for now. Did the rest of the block know this was going to happen? The uproar sounded almost as celebratory as it was horrified. These guys were hysterical. Then something happened that I’d never seen once in the twelve years since I first got here... The lights shut off. 

I heard sixty cell doors unlatch one by one. B block had lost all power. A wave of panic flooded my body. Then, just barely visible in the smoldering rubble, flashlights began to illuminate the wild scene below. Ninety-five of the meanest bastards engaged in a full on assault against the B block night-watch. I don’t know what came over me in that particular instant, but it felt like my feet were carrying me out of my cell against my will. I had no desire to join the fray, but as I peered over the rafter of the topmost floor of B block, I could see that it was either get out... or get killed.

I ran for it. Navigating through the dark as smoke billowed to the top of B block proved more of a challenge than I had expected. I wasn’t sure where exactly I was planning to go once I got down, but I surmised that somehow, the demolished wall had to be a way out. Was I seriously considering this? Joe’s punishments were as creative as they were brutal, but nothing was as sickening as the contingency for attempted break-outs. Only one guy in living memory had ever tried: Julian. We actually thought the son-of-a-bitch had made it. We were wrong. Caught by Joe himself. Julian came back, but only after Joe had done his work. Cut out Julian’s tongue, gouged his eyes out, broke both of his legs and threw him back in B block. He barely lasted two days, but the sights and sounds of a blind and mute cripple had burned deep into my memory. Joe hated us, but he loved to see us suffer. Psychological scars were his favorite to leave behind.

I’d reached the second level, a mere ten feet from the atrium floor. The stairs leading down, however, had been blown completely off the rafters by a giant chunk of the wall. I had no choice but to leap down. There would be no going back, but then again, there’d be no future if I stayed. If I survived. I leapt down and felt the glass crunch beneath my feet. Immediately I saw a guard take a swing in my direction with his baton and took the full force of the blow right across my face. I tasted blood. Between the sting of the baton and the smoke, I could barely open my eyes to see the guard charge forward for another attack. I don’t know if I felt regret in that instance or rage. All that took over was a desire to get out. The guard overshot his second swing, missing me by mere inches, and I took my shot. I drove my knee hard into his chest and he staggered backward, desperate for air. Without giving a second of respite to my weakened opponent, I punched him hard in the face and he collapsed on the floor. Twelve years of defending myself against psychopaths and murderers had bizarrely paid off. But there was no time to celebrate my victory, because an all-too-familiar sound pierced the roar of the battle: gunfire.

Guards in B block weren’t permitted to have firearms. A precaution that kept them safe, in case an inmate somehow managed to wrestle it from a guard. I realized that the cavalry must have arrived: guards from A and C blocks. Within seconds, two dozen men bearing assault rifles charged into the atrium. I dropped to the floor just as they opened fire again. Six guys closest to the south wall collapsed. Shot dead. That feeling I had before, about rage and regret? I concluded it was neither. It was fear.

“ENOUGH!” came a raspy-voiced yell.

The gunfire stopped. The few remaining inmates had been subdued by the wave of new guards. I guess the only reason I wasn’t pinned down yet was because I hadn’t moved from my spot on the floor. But I didn’t need to look up to know who the voice belonged to.

Joe was standing in the entryway.

“Clean this filth up!”

He turned, coughing violently. All this excitement must have really riled him up. It had been almost three years since I’d seen Joe in person, and this was probably going to be the last. He didn’t look all that different to be honest. He still sported his dark grey warden uniform complete with aviators in the front shirt pocket and a black beret atop his nearly bald head. There was also his trademark flask of gin and a Ruger Blackhawk on his hip. The cane was new though. Time yields for no man, I guess. He was escorted out of B block by four armed guards. For me, it was the end of the road. I had no choice but to wait for a guard to come find out I was still alive. My blood ran ice-cold. I was trembling. I don’t know when I decided, and whether it was stupid or brave I couldn’t tell you, but I got up on my hands and knees and surrendered.

“You there! Freeze!” shouted a nameless guard.

I had no intention of disobeying, until a second explosion sent both new and old debris flying towards the entrance. I’d be dead if I weren’t so low to the ground already. I turned for the briefest of glances to see that the guards would not impede my exit, and I bolted. Fifty feet to go... thirty... less than ten... I heard bullets fly past me but I’d made it behind the cafeteria and into what was left of the kitchen. There was only a raging wall of flames between B block and the outside world. Absolutely fueled by adrenaline and maybe a touch of insanity, I ran through. I could feel my skin blistering. I could hardly breathe. It was hell. But it was hope, something I hadn’t felt in decades.

It was a short lived high. At that instant, a searing pain in the back of my right thigh sent me tumbling to the ground. I reached down to inspect the source of my agony. A bullet straight through my leg. Then I felt a rough hand grasp the seared collar of my jumpsuit and drag me towards a black SUV. I writhed against my captor, but I had nothing left to give. I was exhausted, bloodied and burned. I had lost. I passed out...

I awoke when the cold, hard steel of a gun barrel connected to my temple. I tried to retaliate but received another even more brutal hit to the opposite side of my head. Dazed, I finally caught sight of my captor: Joe. He wasn’t a particularly tall man, but when you found yourself at Joe’s feet as many had before, it was hard to not feel helpless. Then, excruciating pain. Blinding, absolute torture. Joe had jabbed the blunt end of his cane into the bullet-wound. I screamed, but nothing came out except a hoarse, almost inhuman sound. I begged.

“FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE! PLEASE!!”

“Shut up! You’re going to suffer! I’ll kill you with my bare hands for what you’ve done!” 

Joe dug his cane deeper into the wound.

“You’re fucking insane. I didn’t have anything to do with that explosion!”

“Oh I know you didn’t! You and all the rest of your ilk are heathens! How stupid do you think I am!”

It didn’t make any sense. Joe knew something, and he was just enraged enough that he might spill the secret. My life was minutes away from ending anyway, the least I could do was try to force it out of him.

“So... I guess there won’t be any transport tomorrow.”

Joe turned so red he blended in with the flames. A white-hot pain flooded my leg. Joe ripped the cane out and swung it so hard against my face I felt my teeth crack.

“COWARD! Just kill me now! You’re a miserable old man with nothing left to live for!”

“SHUT...”

A second hit with the cane

“YOUR...”

A third.

“FUCKING...”

Four.

“MOUTH!!”

Joe pressed the blunt end hard into my throat. I thought he might pierce it.

“My demolition crew failed spectacularly, but that is hardly a concern of mine anymore! I don’t care if you live or die. In B block, or anywhere! I’ll never have to deal with you again!”

It clicked. B block had been scheduled to be demolished, but not by machinery. By dynamite. A premature explosion. A disastrous stroke of luck. I would have laughed if I could. Here I lay, bleeding, bruised, burned and broken, staring up at the man who had caused the misery of hundreds if not thousands of men. Even if my life was nearing its end, it still felt like a victory. I managed a weak smile, and Joe noticed. The last mistake I ever made.

Joe wrapped his hands so tight around my throat I saw stars. This was it. Through clenched teeth, Joe spoke.

“You have no idea who I am, do you?”

I spoke my last words...

“Joe...”

If there was one thing that man hated more than B block. More than every soul in that Godforsaken hellhole. Apparently more than me now, was that name. Joe tightened his grip, crushing my windpipe.

“I’m your worst fucking nightmare, kid. And you’re the drunk asshole that got my family killed. I should have put you down the instant you set foot in my prison. But I swore I’d make your life a living hell as long as I lived.”

So Joe was the man who survived twelve years ago. The reason I was here. Intoxicated driving. I remember now. The trial. My sentencing. I killed three people. And now I knew who they were. Joe’s wife, his daughter and his grandson. I took his whole family away in an instant. His life. Now he was going to take mine. I deserved it. Joe was right, I was irredeemable. I stopped resisting, and saw only blackness...

It’s true what they say. Your life really does flash before your eyes when you die. But I didn’t know it’d be so loud. Then I opened my eyes. Joe was gone. Was this Hell? I wouldn’t be surprised, It looked exactly like the outside of B block. I sat up, the pain in my leg returning.

“Oh my God...”

It wasn’t my life flashing before my eyes. It was B block. A third explosion... And then I saw him, impaled through the chest by a jagged piece of iron. He was barely breathing, but he turned his head and locked eyes with me. Even now, taking dying breaths, he terrified me. He reached down at his side for his gun, but froze as soon as his hand grazed the holster. He didn’t move again. Joe was dead.

I sat there in silence for what felt like hours... and then I heard voices. I dragged myself towards Joe and frantically searched him, looking for keys. The voices grew louder. I was out of time. Then I felt them, and yanked the keys to the SUV out of Joe’s pocket. I grabbed his cane and used it to prop myself up. I was five feet from the driver’s side door of the SUV. Every step was torture, but I kept going. Nothing was going to stop me.

The engine roared to life, a weird sensation. I hadn’t driven sober in twelve years. But I didn’t have time to reflect on my driving history. The sound of the ignition had attracted two guards right to my position. 

“FREEZE!”

I floored it. Tearing through the loose gravel of the prison lot I headed for the exit. It was my only way out. It was like a maze, I never knew exactly where B block was on the property, and the forty-foot tall concrete walls never helped me get my bearings. But I didn’t care, I had no choice but to stick to my route. I drove erratically, smashing into a security kiosk as I whipped around a corner. Finally I saw it, the exit and the large steel doors leading to my salvation. Miraculously, Joe’s SUV triggered the automatic doors and they began to slowly swing open. I could make it, I had to go for it.

The SUV’s side-view mirrors shattered against the doors as I barreled through. All I saw behind me was a faint orange glow where B block stood. Suddenly a blinding light bathed the car and the earth shook. The fourth and final explosion. Every single charge must have gone off at once. I didn’t care, I drove aimlessly until I ran out of gas. I had to take a piss anyway and ditch my jumpsuit, but I needed cash first. After a quick search, I found Joe’s wallet in the console. Jackpot.

But there wasn’t cash. Instead, I found Joe’s license. A much happier man smiled back at me. Unaware that I was the last face this Joe would ever see. And then I saw it: his real name.


...4 months later...


It was still headline news, people just couldn’t stop talking about it:

DEMOLITION DISASTER! EXPLOSION AT HERNANDEZ PENITENTIARY! NO SURVIVORS!

Well, we all know that’s not true. But hey, I was dead to the world. I kept my head down and left my old life behind. There was nothing from my past I wanted or even needed. But I resolved to be a better man. I finished my coffee, put on my coat and headed out the door of the café.

“Mister! Hey, Mister!”

I turned around and saw a young boy carrying something towards me.

“You forgot your cane, sir.”

“Thank you, young man. But please...

...call me Joe.”

162,RitterCorvum,1613703607,"I don’t take my job lightly; most clients that hire me expect me to blend in and mingle with the other guests. I am supposed to keep an eye on any potential threats that might arise during these galas while doing these things. But, I find myself distracted by someone I feel like I have seen before. 

His maroon eyes glitter in the light of the chandelier, and his throaty laugh fills the room with an unknown glee. He blends in perfectly with the crowd, but I can see through his playful exterior. Hidden beneath is someone prepared to kill at any cost,  someone who is methodical, and someone clear-minded though I can also see the turmoil within him brought about from years of relentless training. He has a brand upon his neck, and it is the mark of the beast. I now know that he is apart of higher jurisdiction, and I know that talking to him would not be my place. 

So ignoring the parts that want me to talk to him, I walk to the open library to look at the collection of books. As I look in the library, I notice many books that relate to demons and their kin. Grabbing one of the books, I see that there are tabs marking pages of the book that have to do with Lucifer and Legion. Books that have to do with Sameal, the seven deadly sins, and Lilith are also marked heavily with tabs. An obsession takes over me to look at every book within this library, but I have to restrain myself from doing so. I know that greed is a dangerous thing to play with clients’ possessions, especially with ones of such high acclaim as my current client. 

“You should leave before my father finds you in here,” A sweet and velvety voice says behind me. Turning around, I see a girl, no older than 10, standing behind me with a book in hand. “I know that he hired you to keep an eye on his party and not his books. The library doors are open for the other demonologists at this gala.” 

“I’m sorry,” I say softly. I approach the girl after I put the book I am holding away; she steps away from me when I get too close to her, and I can see that she is afraid of me. Her eyes grow wide, and her face becomes pale when she sees the way I look. 

To describe what I look like is overly simple as I do not look like the child of a demon. I am not as handsome, nor do I look like other demonic children. I have fair skin, green and blue eyes, and brown hair. To expand on my hair, it is in a messy pixie cut look, and it was dyed maroon before letting it grow out naturally. The only odd physical feature I possess is my sharpened canines that look like fangs. In all honesty, I don’t look scary. Others in my field say that I don’t look like a killer, that I look far too innocent to be one. 

Seeing the fear in this girl’s eyes tells either one of two things. She knows what I am, or she can sense what I am through supernatural means. But, I’m not sure what would be worse for this girl to know. She is far too young to understand what I am doing for my job. But, she is also still at the age where demons seem to the scariest things under the sun.

“You are wise to keep your distance,” I sigh, “and I insist that you stay that wise,” I say this to her with a growl. I watch as fear completely takes over the girl’s brave face, and she runs off with the sound of her clicking heels. When I notice that the girl is in heels, I wonder how I did not hear her approach me in the library. 

*‘Don’t let that get to you.’* I tell myself as I walk back into the ballroom. ‘*You must have gotten lost in those books, which was a mistake. Get back to work and act as if nothing happened.’*

Music fills the ballroom as guests float around with dancing partners. The music is a simple waltz, one that I learned when I was in my training, but one that proved to be most difficult for those who have never waltzed before. There are very few people not dancing, five if I am counting correctly. Lord Magna, Lady Magna, their daughter, Lucifer’s kin, and I are those who are not participating in the waltz. Approaching the group of watchers, I sense that blood is in the air. The eyes of the Lord, Lady, and child are already red with bloodlust, and Lucifer’s kin is looking around the room for the source of the blood. Our eyes soon meet, and his thoughts link with mine. 

*‘They can tell us where the blood is, but I would think that they would prefer not to. Those who lust for blood are secretive about these things.’* The sound of his voice piercing my mind sends energy throughout my body. His voice is gentle, but it carries a tone of authority many want to have in their voice. ‘*They seem to be enjoying their guests; I wonder what they are planning on doing with them.’*

*‘Why do you wonder about that master?’* I ask with grace, gently touching his mind so that we may speak. 

*‘It would seem that during the night, Lord Magna slipped his blood into the wine. I could taste it as I drank, but you did not touch the wine, so I cannot blame you for not notices such a thing. His blood is potent with his disease of blood lust. The Lord also has control of his blood. So, allowing it to sit in their wine is the perfect way to gain control over them. Tonight I believe that Lord Magna and Lady Magna are planning on making their den.’* 

*‘It would explain why the people are dancing, master; he seems to be testing his ability. But, there is the question of how would they turn all of these guests in one night?’* 

*‘There is a simple way of putting it; the guests have willingly taken in the Lord’s blood, and now he needs to take in trace amounts of his blood to turn them into one who lusts for blood. Lord Magna will not overeat tonight, but we will watch as his guests suffer through the most painful way of turning’.* 

*‘Then why are we here tonight? I have accounted for every guest, and I do not seem to see one that is missing.’*   
 *‘The reason for our arrival is simple. We are to watch these people painfully turn into blood-lusting creatures, and enjoy ourselves.’* 

*‘That seems rather morbid, even for the academy’s standards. They would rather watch us suffer than watch others suffer. You should know that. I’m sorry, master, but I don’t think I should stay here.’* 

“Stop calling me master!” He snaps, breaking our mental connection with a feeling of dread. “I might be above you, but I am not your master.” 

I cower in fear as he stares me down with his now golden eyes. I can sense the shift of the energy of the room now; it’s unstable and dangerous. I feel so put off by this energy that I leave the room. Stopping one of the servants, I ask them to lead me to a guest room, and they happily agree to take me to a room.

When I reach the room, my head feels fuzzy, and I stumble to the bed. Everything feels like it is moving so fast, and I don’t know what is causing me to feel this way. Soon my consciousness fades, and I slip into the abyss of sleep. I am unsure as to when I will wake up. But, I know that it will not be when the sun rises.   ",stories,Dark Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ln4xad/dark_academia/,1613674807.0

164,TheTrickSide,1613702661,"Soo here is some backstory. 

My neighbor takes care of chickens and does work in his backyard. His house is right behind mine. But, little did I know, the fence was a bit loose.

I was in class when I hear pecking at my sliding door. I turn around my neighbor's chicken is pecking at the window. I tried knocking on the window to scare it off but he just kept roaming around.

I waited for my dad to be done getting ready for work so he can go take care of it but he was taking a while so I started to panic/laugh because it was weird and crazy. But THEN, I look back out the window and a CAT is out there chilling with the chicken. I explained the situation to my teacher and for some reason, he believed me. So I waited like 20 minutes before my dad came out of his room.

I told him about the mini backyard farm we had and you could tell in his voice that he wasn't having this shit. He took me outside with him and told me to get the shovel, which kinda scared me because I didn't wanna HURT it. I just wanted to scare it back into the crack of the fence.

But THAT wasn't an option because for some reason the fence acting like a doggy door and once you flip the broken board to get in, you couldn't flip it back. The cat was smart and ran away as soon as it heard my footsteps. Good news, we didn't have to use the shovel. We scared it into a corner in my backyard and my dad told me to pick up the broken chain-link fence on the ground and block him in. I was holding the fence out there, bare-footed, for about 15 minutes before my dad shows up with some other dude who I thik lives in the neighbor's house????

Anyway, long story short, the cock was contained in a box, (after sooo much struggle, btw) and was returned to the neighbor. We had the neighbor tighten the fence soo yeah.

Chapter 9: The village of Philis, part 1


As the group walked just north of Serafring, the path that they took began to turn narrow. Before, it was a vast plain of grass. Now, the trees became a lot more abundant. After reaching a certain point in their walk, the trees became more clumped up, less space in between them like it was trying to form a solid wall of wood. The trees themselves were a little less lively, less leaves and less color; the deeper in, the more dead the trees looked.

“You sure this is the right way, Danny?” Leonard asked.

“It shows on the map that we are…don't get me wrong, I'm getting that feeling too,” Daniel said. “But don't worry, we are nearly there at Philis.”

Loralie walked beside Daniel; she thought it would be nice to strike up a conversation.

“So, Daniel. What's your story?” she asked.

He turned his head but didn't have an answer. He just stared off blankly, thinking, and then he spoke, “My story, huh. I'm from Elenore, where I grew up.”

“Elenore? I believe I've heard of that place. Isn't it very far from here?”

“Yeah, it's pretty far.”

She tilted her head, “Why did you leave? You sound as if you didn't regret.”

“Well, I left because I wanted to find some kind of purpose in life; something to do. There was nothing for me at my village so I set out to the world. Mostly, I just walked aimlessly around until I stumbled upon Ohollio; that's where I found Elizabeth.”

“Oh my, my condolences...surely it was a terrible experience for you,” Loralie said.

“Huh? No, I'm glad to meet Elizabeth and Ohollio. In fact, the whole reason I'm here on this journey is because of that.”

“Hmm, to each their own I guess,” she said in surprise. “I understand what you mean by finding purpose, although. I had that same feeling when I was a child. I would be in the castle nearly for the whole day, studying.”

Daniel asked, “Study for what?”

“Various things: accounting, management, manners, language and literacy, mathematics, philosophy, etcetera etcetera.”

Daniel was blown away, “That many things? I don't understand why they would force all those things on a child!”

“I kinda agree with you on that, however, it was necessary for me to learn all those things if I were to be fit for queen of Serafring. My father can't stay king forever you know,” she said.

“I mean, yeah I see your point.”

“I also had to learn my elemental powers if I were to rule; a ruler must be powerful. I'm still in training, but I hope that I will come out a master in this journey. Trust me Daniel, a master elementalist is a sight to behold.”

“Yeah, I can't wait to be one too!” he said.

Loralie giggled happily as they continued to have their conversation. Meanwhile, Leonard and Elizabeth are right behind having their own talks.

“It's weird, don't you think?” Elizabeth said into the air.

Leonard looked down, “Huh? What's weird?”

“Y’know, just how happily she got along with you two and just completely disliked me!” she pointed out. “Did I do something wrong or something?” Elizabeth looked at herself to see any imperfections, from shoes to pants to shirt to hair. Even sniffing herself a little to check her hygiene.

“Y’know, come to think of it, it was pretty weird how she forced you to kneel and address her as a princess…” he scratched his stubble.

“Yeah, like she hates me or something.”

“Huh? You? Hate? There's no way! I've never met a single soul that has even slightly disliked you! I'll talk to her and see what's up her alley, sound good?” he asked.

“No, I got a better idea. I'll just do my best to befriend her! Eventually, she'll be nice to me!”

“Hehehe! I'm sure it'll work! It worked on me afterall!” he chuckled. “No matter how hard she pushes you away, you keep on going!”

“Yeah!” She jumped up into the air for a high five but ultimately was left hanging. When she landed, she was filled with disappointment.

“What? You should've said ‘high five!’ at least. Like I knew you were gonna go for one,” he said in defense.

Nearly tripping over some branches, she looked around and took in her surroundings, “hey, is the sky getting a little...greyer?” she realized.

Leonard looked up high, his field of view being filled with a smooth, grey brown-ish sky. He could see his own eye fluids just from staring at the sky long enough. There was still light to resemble daytime, but the transition from a clear sky back at Serafring to a melancholy grey one felt odd to him.

“Probably clouds, there's no way the sky would just change color like that.” he said conclusively. After looking back forward, he began to see, right where the trees parted, a resemblance of a village.

“Oi! Look at that, we've finally made it!” he said.

Loralie looked surprised, “really? I guess a little chatting helps pass a lot of time after all.”

Daniel looked at the map one last time for confirmation, “Yep, this is the place.”

Once they exited the dense and grey forest, the village itself didn't look different either. All the buildings looked mighty old, as if none of them had any upkeep for the last couple years. The ground was dead and desolate, nothing but hard dirt. The vegetation was meager, not a single lively tree or flower were present. The people that walked around had dirty faces and dilapidation clothing. Overall, the place looked quite destitute. The scenery greatly shifted the group’s mood from carefree to slight anxiousness.

“Is this...Philis?” Elizabeth asked with a slight nervousness.

“Yes, this is the village of Philis.” A grown man showed up from the side to greet them. He wore tattered clothing, similar to what a person would wear in the winter. He had black greasy hair and dirt covering his face but looked quite happy to see the group. “Welcome, itis so nice to have travelers come every now and then. Would you like me to show you around?” he coughed a little but brushed it off.

Loralie was showing slight concern, “Mister, has this place always been like this? I don't mean to be rude or to talk down on your home, but…” she lightly placed her hand on her face.

“Why, I take no offense, madam. My name is Kerine, I am a shop owner. It's quite hard to make a living here but I always make it through.” He scanned all of their faces, “are these your travel companions?”

Leonard stepped in, “Yes, she's with us. My name is Leonard. Nice to meet you, Kerine.”

“No, the pleasure is mine. It's rare we get people from outside the village coming in! You see, this is a very dull place.” He looked off for a second and then back to the group.

“Hey, mister Kerine,” Elizabeth asked, “are there any Inns that we could stay in?”

Kerin’s dirty face lit up, “W-why of course! We also have meat and vegetable markets as well!” He became almost excited, pointing towards every location of stores and other markets.

“Markets, huh,” Daniel said. “Y'know, I am pretty hungry at the moment,” he rubbed his belly, making it growl softly.

“Yes. I'm afraid that I should've eaten something before we left,” Loralie added.

“Yeah, I could eat sumthin’,” Leonard said.

“Of course! I will show you the markets!” Kerine insisted.

Kerine clutched his tattered clothing as he guided the group into the village. They all looked around like tourists. The inside was just as bad as the outside, the stands of the markets looked ramshackled and just about ready to break. The foods displayed weren't appetizing either, all strung about haphazardly. In one of the stands, there were only four small measly carrots about the size of a hand. However, the shopkeeper showed them proudly. Next to one of them was a tradesman holding a leash attached to a pretty old and malnourished donkey. Finally, they reached their destination. Kerine proudly presented the market area and encouraged the group to spend as much as they pleased. The group split into two once again, Daniel and Leonard, Loralie and Elizabeth. Loralie and Elizabeth found a meat stand. In it was a frail woman who was happy to see new customers. She spoke with dry excitement, “Ah! Yes, yes! Anything that catches your eye?”

The two scanned the display. There were four various meats each of different sizes. However, the way that they looked and smelled and the troubling amount of flies buzzing around turned them off a little. Loralie, however, wasn't turned off by the meat, rather, it was the shopkeeper that bothered her.

“A woman? Running a shop? Don't you have a family to tend to?” Loralie sneered.

Both the lady and Elizabeth looked at her, confused. All the lady could muster out was an “i’m sorry?” but Loralie pressed on.

“Seriously, a woman can't handle such responsibilities like owning a shop. What will your husband think of? Shouldn't he be the one running this?”

“I..i-i…” the lady stuttered.

Elizabeth stepped in, “Loralie, what are you doing?” but was ignored.

Defending herself, the lady bit back, “What's it to you, madam? I'm just trying to provide for my family!”

Loralie laughed, “That's the job of a man! What makes you think you can handle what a man does? Everyone knows that people like you should be at home, tending to your kin, cleaning and making them food. That's all.”

Elizabeth couldn't even believe what she was saying. Was this her true colors, she thought? The lady was absolutely affronted and told the both of them to leave immediately.

“We didn't need your gross meat anyway!” Loralie said as she was dragged away by Elizabeth. Covering her face with embarrassment, she asked, “What the heck was that for? What do you mean by 'that's a man’s job’?”

“First off, get your grubby hands off of mine, and secondly, who gave that girl the right to run a shop?”

Wanting to escape the situation, Elizabeth looked desperately for the others. She saw the remaining two over at a vegetable stand. Daniel and Leonard stood side by side, inspecting the mountain of greens.

“What do you think?” the shopkeeper asked with a slight hope that they will buy.

The vegetables were decently fresh and appealing but wasn't to Leonard’s liking. He pondered for a moment and a little idea knocked in his head.

“Say, shopkeeper,” Leonard asked.

The shopkeeper looked up, “Y-yes?”

“Is there…a stream nearby? Like are there rivers around this village?”

“Why, yes. There's one not too far from here, actually. Just leave the way you came and head to the right. It's some dense terrain but you'll find one quick, I say!”

“Aha! C’mon Dan, let's go,” he nudged Daniel’s shoulder.

He was confused for a moment, “Wait, hold on. What are we going to a river for?”

“I'll show ya in a moment! Now, let's go.”

“But what about the others?”

Practically pushing him at this point, Leonard kept on going, “I'm sure they're fine. We will all meet up later, trust me.It's just gonna be you and me, perfect bonding!”

Leonard pulled Daniel off of his feet and placed him facing the entrance of the town. Patting his back, he went off. Not knowing what to do, Daniel just followed him to the river. Just as he was about to take a step, he felt a hand tap on his shoulder. When he turned around, it was them.

Daniel saw Elizabeth with one hand covering her face just slightly, as if she was avoiding being seen. Loralie was behind her with her arms crossed looking away. 

“Hey, Danny, where are you guys heading?” Elizabeth asked.

“Leonard wanted to go find a river for something. He wanted me to join so i'm heading over there now.”

“A river? I wonder what he is up to,” Loralie tilted her head.

“Hey, do you mind if I tag along? Maybe just one more person or two?” Elizabeth let go of her face and held both her hands clenched to her chest, in a begging way.

Daniel looked off for a brief moment, “W-well, Leonard said that it was only for the both of us. Something about bonding, I kinda look forward to it actually.”

Elizabeth was about to add more but Loralie concluded the conversation, “A bonding moment? Then absolutely, we will leave the two of you be!” Loralie turned her heel and started to walk away. In a slight apprehension, she lightly tugged Elizabeth on her hood signaling her to follow along. After that, Daniel waved goodbye to the two, “We will meet up with you two later!”

Yanking back her hood, Elizabeth asked, “What was that about?”

Loralie gave a harrumph like the answer was obvious, “The bonding between two men is something you never get in between, dear Elizabeth. Of course, you wouldn't understand, being a female and all.”

Lines formed between her eyebrows, “H-Huh?”

Rubbing her forehead, Loralie clarified, “It is necessary, especially for a child's development, that he bonds with a father figure. It is something you have to make time for and prioritize. Strong men make stronger men, certainly you can grasp that idea.”

She opened her mouth to speak but no words came out. Placing her knuckles on her lips, she uttered, “You're right. Fine, let's go. But please don't act up like you did last time!”

Back to Daniel. He was back at the path that they took into Philis, this time backwards. He looked up down and all around to see any resemblance of a river. Scratching his head he called out, “Leonard, where have you gone off to?”

In the distance, a rough voice echoed out, “Ova’ here!”

Following the source of the call, he stumbled upon a small opening in the path. It was a steep drop but walkable. He had to duck a little to avoid low hanging branches smacking against his head. After climbing down and walking a fair bit, he began to hear the sound of rushing water; the sound of a stream. When he reached the sound, he saw Leonard standing right in the middle, unaffected by the rushing water around him. The water sloshed around his legs like the ocean crashing against a shore. He had both of his hands on his hips, breathing in the air and exhaling loudly. He turned his head and immediately lit up.

“There ya are! Now, there's something I want the both of us to do,” he said.

Standing at the edge of the river, Daniel lifted his arms, “Like what?”

“Were catching some fish!” he proudly announced.

His eyebrows threw upwards “Huh? Really? I've never done something like that before!”

Waving his hand, “Don't worry about a thing! Ima do most of the catching! All you gotta do is catch.”

Asking for affirmation, “Are you sure there are fish in that river?”

“Please, I could feel them swimming around my feet. Watch!”

He positioned himself in a wide stance. Closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. For a moment, the river began to quiver and vibrate. Then, a column of water rose into the air right in front of Leonard. The water fell back down like rain, nearly wetting Daniel. There, floating in the air, was a fish suspended in a bubble of water. It swam around vigorously like a fish in a bowl. Leonard chuckled lightly, “Still got it!”

Daniel stood there without blinking, jaw nearly dropped, simply amazed by his powers once again. He began to laugh excitedly, “That was amazing!”

“Yeah! Now, catch!” Leonard said.

Still controlling the bubble with his finger tips, he swiftly pointed them right at Daniel’s direction. The bubble glided in the air smoothly, Daniel saw the bubble looming over him. Then he realized, “Wait...how am I gonna catch it? I don't have some kind of bowl to place it!” He waves his arms in the air to signal him to stop. Leonard went from enjoying himself to disappointment.

“Great! Now how are we gonna store our meals? Hmm…” he stroked his stubble for a moment. A bright idea came to his mind. Without telling, he simply took out more fish and placed them into the bubble, increasing its size and volume. Eventually, the ball became a whole school of fish swimming around like an aquarium.

“There we go,” Leonard said.

Daniel gave a thumbs up and told him, “Nice one.”

Leonard walked out of the lake and back on land to take a breather, still controlling the bubble. Daniel sat next to him.

“That was some amazing water elemental you did there,” Daniel said.

“Thanks. I learned it when I lived in the woods for some time.”

Daniel turned his head, “You lived alone in the woods before?”

He leaned back and was prepared to tell a tale, “You see, when I wanted to become stronger, learning how to rely on myself was on that list. I was a bit older then, only 22. I stood right in front of the edge of the forest, reflecting on my decision. After adventuring for some time, there was a house I found and made it my own. Sure, it was abandoned and broken down a little, but it beats sleeping in a dirt hole, y’know what I mean?” he laughed, “It was a little cozy in that house. And, near it, was a river similar to this one right here,” he pointed to the river, “and in that river, fish were swimming and rushing all around. I thought to myself, how am I gonna catch ‘em? Then, a bright idea came to me, I used my elemental ability. Just like you, I was surprised as hell when it worked. I nearly had a mountain of fish that lasted me days!”

He adjusted his seating a bit and looked at Daniel, “You see, it is important to have self reliance.”

Daniel turned his attention to him, “Yeah, absolutely. I had to learn how to do most things on my own when I was a kid.”

“Mhm. Kids these days! They always think that things will be done for them, y’know? They always think mama or Papa will always be there for them, or that someone else will do it. Lookie here, Danny, it's better to do things yourself. Afterall, only you know how you want things done. You get what I mean?” he asked.

“Yeah, I do. I've been mostly alone for my life. I mean, I was taken care of from time to time from other parents in my home village but they never really took me in. It was tough, really. Both physically and emotionally. Over some time, I grew numb to it. I was used to being alone at some point, I was used to doing things myself like getting food or using tools and sword fighting.”

Daniel tucked his knees into his chest, “But...it was...lonely, y’know? Even though I was numb to it, even though I was used to being alone, I always felt...lonely.”

He hunched over his back, as if his own words weighed him down greatly. Just a while ago he was fine but now he looked gloomy. Leonard was touched a little by his story and patted him on the back to cheer him up, all while he was still controlling the bubble of water filled with raging fish.

“Hey, kid, listen. You've done a great job being on your own. But now you're no longer alone. You got me, Elizabeth, and Loralie! What more can you want? Hahahah!”

This put a smile on Daniel’s face, “Haha, you're right! I'm glad I've met you, Leonard.”

“Me too, Danny, me too.”

They did a little fist bump and began to rise. Still controlling the bubble, Leonard told Daniel that they should be heading back with the food they have.

“Are you seriously bringing that huge thing back in the village?” Daniel said wide eyed.

“Hmmmm, yerright. Maybe we should set up a fire here and cook. But first, we gotta get back to the two.”

Leonard pointed to a decently wide enough area far from the river that will fit all four of them.

“I'll stay here holding this thing, you can get the others,” Leonard said.

Daniel nodded and was on his way. He left the way he came and was back on the trail into Philis. He started to ponder on what Loralie and Elizabeth are doing while they were away.

Cut back to Elizabeth and Loralie. Being the lead, Loralie decided to look upon another stand-this time with a male owner. She looked around and found a familiar face standing near a particular stand. It was Kerine, dirty face and all, dusting off the corners of the stand, trying to make it look more presentable. When he saw the two approaching his stand he went all excited, “Oh, you two again! Are you interested in what I am selling?”

“I am most curious,” Loralie replied.

“Yeah. Watcha got?” Elizabeth added.

“W-well, I don't sell food but I am sure some firewood will be handy for your travels! I just chopped them today, fresh ‘n all.” He placed a large bundle of thick firewood on the table, nearly shaking the whole stand. Loralie placed her knuckle on her bottom lip and eyed the bundles of wood thoroughly. Elizabeth looked over her shoulder, wondering what her decision was going to be. Kerine sweated nervously. After that small silent moment, Loralie clapped once and announced that she will buy it all. Both Kerine and Elizabeth were struck with an equal amount of awe and shock.

“A-all?” Kerine said.

“A-all?” Elizabeth said.

“Yes, all. Some firewood would definitely help us with our journey since we will mostly be on foot. I do dislike the bitter cold, after all. And besides, it looks as though you are in desperate need of money and I do not mind being a bit generous!”

With that, she pulled out a white purse that shimmered radiantly and pulled out a hefty amount of currency. She placed it all on Kerine’s hand gently. “Take it,” she said. “You should be rewarded for your hard work. Don't spend it all foolishly!”

Elizabeth was struck by her generosity, she couldn't help but feel like Loralie had redeemed herself for her past actions. She smiled warmly and said, “Wow, Loralie. You really helped him out! I never knew you were that generous.”

“I believe that a person should be rewarded greatly by the work that they do. He chopped down all the lumber for customers like us, it must've been laborious, cutting trees all day long!”

Kerine was overjoyed, “T-thank you so much! This will definitely help my fa-” but he was cut off. Walking up right behind him came a tall man wearing a bandanna on his forehead. The man did not look as if he belonged in the town, he looked out of place. His clothes weren't as dilapidated as Kerine’s and he was quite clean. He placed his hand on Kerine's shoulder forcefully, making him nearly jump. He gripped it tightly and grinned.

“Well, lookie here. It looks like someone has made the big bucks, haven't they?” His voice was gruffy and deep and it even made Kerine shiver a bit when he heard it. Elizabeth’s expression completely changed as soon as the man presented himself, and so did Loralie.

“O-oh...um, h-hello, Dalimon,” Kerine's voice was shaky and stuttering. The currency rattled like bells on his trembling palms.

“Just came to check on ya. Seeing if business is boomin’, y'know?” The man hanged his head over Kerine's shoulder and saw the massive amounts of currency piled in his hands, “Woah! I knew choppin’ up wood would finally get you somewhere,” he forcefully grabbed nearly all of the currency, leaving only a couple pieces, and shoved them in his pockets.

Loralie was appalled by this, having the money she gave being taken away by someone else. She glared at the man with her jaw clenched, “Excuse me!”

The man looked up as if he just realized she was there, “Huh? Oh, yeah you're excused,” and then began to walk away laughing.

Elizabeth shared Loralie’s feelings and prompted to yell at the man, “Hey! That wasn't for you, it was for Kerine!” but he didn't even turn his head. Elizabeth looked back at Kerine to see if any of this was a joke. He just sat there with his head down, silent. She walked around the stand and stood next to him, “Kerine, that man just stole from you and you're just gonna sit there?”

“It's alright,” he sighed. He lifted himself up, his face gloomy. “This happens all the time, everytime, really.”

Elizabeth was stunned, “What do you mean all the time? You mean about him taking your money?”

Loralie came after yelling at the man to no avail, “I cannot believe that just happened! I'm so sorry, Kerine.”

He shook his head, “No no, it happens all the time. He is like the boss of the area.”

Loralie and Elizabeth looked at each other, puzzled.

“The boss?” Elizabeth asked, “is he your boss?”

“In a way, yeah. He's like the boss of everyone's shop here.” He pointed his finger towards all the shops in the area.

“What kind of boss is this man, taking so much of your earnings?” Loralie said.

“Yeah, I know...His name is Dalimon, one of the members of the gang.”

“Gang?” Elizabeth asked, “what gang?” She crouched to his height.

Kerine lifted his head and began to tell them the story of their village. It was with slight reluctance, he began to speak.

“Many years ago, this village was originally named theodore. Then, one day, three men showed up: Dalimon, Goral, and Philis. They lived in the village of Theodore for quite some time however they would constantly cause mischief. It wasn't until the founder, Theodore, confronted the three and banished them from the village. All three of them became bitter and resentful, they left with a cloud of hatred. Then, suddenly, Theodore disappeared. With no one to guide and lead, the village became aimless. Out of nowhere, the three goons revealed themselves once again, proudly claiming that they are now the leaders. The people disagreed and revolted but somehow the gang was able to make everyone submit. I wasn't there but I was told that they hold a great power. Something that we should fear, they said. As soon as they became the leaders of the village, everything went downhill. The quality of life, the crops, the air, our water, our clothing. Everything you see here is a result of them. This place was once great but now we are stuck like this…they even changed the village name to one of the leaders, Philis. They reside in a mansion atop of the mountain now.” Kerine pointed ahead. A tall hill stretch far above the trees, atop the hill was a large wooden mansion.

He gave a tired sigh and apologized. Kerine sincerely believed that there was nothing anyone could do to help the situation. He simply laid an elbow on his table and stared blankly. Elizabeth, touched by the story, started to get fired up.

“W-what!? That's terrible! You mean to tell me that you're living in oppression and fear? Kerine, why haven't you told us?” Her words echoed in his head. He shook his head again, “No...it isn't fair to have you fine ladies get roped into this…” he strained a fake smile. Loralie was struck the most that she couldn't even find words, she stood there in utter shock.

“If those three men are ruining your home then they need to be stopped…” Loralie mustered.

Elizabeth agreed, “It isn't right for them to treat your lives as little. A village belongs to everyone! It is a community built on comradery. I could never imagine my own home like this…” her mind began to wander briefly. “No, I won't let your village be ruined like this, Kerine! We will help you!” she said.

“We will give those three men a piece of our minds. We will release your shackles of oppression.” Loralie added.

Kerine genuinely was struck, his eyes widened in a glimmer of hope but it quickly disappeared, “N-no, seriously, you don't have to do such a thing! I-It's fine, really,” he tried to assure them, “please, I don't want you to risk your own safety for ours…” he said.

“Nonsense,” Loralie interjected, “I've studied the history of many kingdoms and one thing I have learned is that tyranny is absolutely reprehensible! This injustice cannot continue!” Loralie turned to Elizabeth, “Elizabeth, we must regroup and tell the others, we must fight this together.”

“Right!” she said as she began to stand. “Let's go find Danny and Leonard. They will surely help us!”

They began to move but Kerine tried to stop them, begged even, “Stop! Please, you don't understand. They...t-they will crush y-you…I wouldn't wanna be responsible for your..” he choked nearly. The two looked back and sympathized with him for a moment but they assured him that everything is fine.

“Kerine, I promise you we will help free your village! Besides, we have something up our sleeves that will really help us,” Elizabeth eyed Loralie.

They finally left, on their way to find Daniel and Leonard. Kerine slumped over again and muttered under his breath, “...so do they…”

After some time, they finally met each other. Daniel stumbled upon the two, Loralie and Elizabeth.

Daniel waved his hand, “Oh hey! I was just about to look for you both.”

“Danny, where is Leonard?” Elizabeth asked with a stirn voice.

Daniel tilted his head slightly, “Leonard? Well, he's over at the river. He planned on catching fish for us to eat, did you bring any firewood? I don't have some on me.”

“Daniel, we need your help,” Loralie said.

He started to become even more puzzled, “About what? Is something the matter?” he wanted to know.

Elizabeth stepped forward, “Yes, there is. Have you ever wondered why this village is the way it is?”

The thought did cross his mind but he never really pondered deeply on it. Curious, he asked, “Did you find something? If so, tell me.”

“We want Leonard to hear this as well. Could you take us to him, please?” Loralie asked.

He nodded and showed them the way, taking them through the same route he took. After some branches smacking some heads later, they arrived and met Leonard standing near the river, still controlling the bubble of water.

“There ya are! I've been waiting for y'all, come, come!” he laughed.

Leonard looked at each of their faces and instead of seeing smiles he saw dead seriousness. Their expressions rubbed off onto his, after a moment. He raised the question, “Whassamatta? Sumthin bothering you guys?”

The two girls wanted to answer but were immediately struck by awe at the sight of the floating bubble full of fish. They both looked up, mouth hanging wide open, gasping at the sight. Leonard couldn't help but smile, “Yeah yeah I know! I'm amazing, aren't I?”

“Save the amazement for later, guys. Leonard, there's something both of us need to know; they're gonna tell us,” Daniel said.

He raised an eyebrow, “Is that so? Then, I'm all ears; let's hear it.”

Standing in a circle, the group came together to listen. Elizabeth took the lead on the opening part. She explained to them why the things were the way they were and who was responsible for it. She felt reminiscent of the time she explained to Leonard about the destruction of Ohollio, back at Serafring. The words were different but she felt the same as she did before. Loralie then added her perspective on the story, mentioning the man that stole Kerine's currency and him being one of the gang members. Both of their faces, Leonard and Daniel, shared a mixture of expression. Daniel repeatedly asked questions for clarification, for he did not believe what he was hearing. Leonard, on the other hand, was calm and collective. His eyes were shut and he placed his hand on his stubble chin, taking in the whole story.

“Hmmm….yes, that does sound awful,” Leonard gave his thoughts. “Terrible even.”

“That’s...horrible how they are being treated!” Daniel nearly sprang to fury. A sudden onset of words flowed out of him as rapid as the river they were near. “We have to do something about this! We can't just let these gang members push these poor villagers around.”

“I agree,” Elizabeth stood by Daniel.

“As do I,” Loralie joined.

Leonard stood where he was, looking away slightly.

“Let's go, Leonard,” Daniel commanded.

“Listen,” he said, “I am not saying I don't feel the way you do but we must remember our journey. Remember, we are looking for the ancient Lightning guy.”

“Yes we are, bu-”

“Then we need to have our eyes on that. We should focus on our business. We haven't the time to do something about this village, sadly. Who knows what Malice is up to as we speak!”

Daniel could not believe what he was hearing. “What are you saying? Are you just gonna let these people continue to suffer like this? They deserve to be free; free from oppression.” His eyes glared hard on him, a burning glare.

“We stand by him. We believe that we should at least do something, after all. Even a little.” Loralie stood right beside Daniel, giving the same glare but not as intense. Elizabeth didn't say a word, joining their side. All six eyes were practically shooting daggers at Leonard, getting him to join.

“Listen, none of this is our concern. We have a greater enemy on our heads. If we're just gonna ignore him, this village will probably not be standing any time soon. I just wanna stop him from destroying people's homes. If we allow ourselves to mingle in this situation, who knows what he will plan on doing next…”

Daniel’s glare then changed to a glance. He understood Leonard's feelings but he still believed that they must help the people. He tried his best to convince him, “Leonard, I get what you are feeling. No one wants to take Malice down more than I do. I don't want him to make others suffer, I don't want him to destroy anymore villages. But, I also don't want people to be treated like this, like slaves. Their lives are being ruined by awful people, they don't deserve it! I'm on this journey so I could save people from Malice’s destruction, that's true, but I want to save people from any kind of destruction from anyone. We can't have anymore 'Malices’ now, should we?”

Leonard was taken aback, perhaps he should've changed his mind. His words rang true to him, he couldn't deny it. He looked back at them, they were all waiting for his decision.

“Yerright, sorry about that. You want to help these people, I don't see why not.”

“So you will join us?” Elizabeth asked.

He looked down for a brief moment and that gave a wild thumbs up, “Hell yeah I will!”

All three of them were glad, Elizabeth was jumping in joy. Daniel smiled at him and reached out a hand. They both clasped each other's palm and gripped it tight as if they agreed to a deal.

“Let's go show those gangs their place eh Danny boy?”

“You know it!” he answered.

A chorus of growls filled the area. It was their stomachs. They all stared at each other.

“Uh, yeah. Can we eat first? Those fish in that water bubble are looking tastier by the minute,” Elizabeth pointed out.

“Good idea. Let's grub on some dinner now, shall we?” Leonard said. “Now, does anyone have any wood to start a fire?”

Loralie raised a hand, “Ah yes, I do!”

Elizabeth was surprised, “You have wood on you? Since when?”

“I took some from Kerine, remember? As we were leaving, I brought some with me.”

“Really? I hadn't noticed.”

“Nothing to be ashamed of, it's natural for people of your kind to be quite oblivious to your surroundings.”

Elizabeth jolted her head back, “Erk! What's that supposed to mean?”

Loralie placed a bundle of wood on the ground. “Everyone step back, please,” she asked.

They all listen, albeit confused. She squatted down, just a few feet away from the wood. She breathed in deeply and held her hands to her chest. Daniel realized that she was channeling her element. A low rumble rang in the sky and then a sharp bolt of lightning struck the earth directly upon the bundle of wood making it burst into flames. Everyone was overtaken by amazement. Loralie chuckled a little, “I'm glad it worked!”

“That was amazing Loralie. I nearly forgot that you were an elementalist,” Daniel said.

With the fire crackling satisfyingly, Leonard took out, one by one, each fish from the bubble of water and placed them upon the fireplace. They all sat around and socialized, enjoying their meals, sharing laughs and their plans. Daniel felt a new feeling, a feeling of comradery. He was used to being alone nearly all his life but now he knew how it felt to be with others. Oh how he loved this feeling. Once they were done with their meals, they headed back into Philis for their new objective.


Who are the gang members?

Will the people of Philis be free?

What kind of powers will we see Loralie reveal?

167,shoctologist,1613697130,"He  takes me into his hand, cradling my head and wrapping his fingers  around the back of my neck as he’s done so many times before. A gentle  squeeze of his index finger and thumb – and again he has me exactly  where he wants me.

His embrace is  warmth, it’s safety – his hand against me feels like a reinforced wall,  impenetrable – and I feel completely secure in his grasp.

*It’s time again, isn’t it?* *I’m ready, yours to command.* *Use me.*

My  entire life has been devoted to serving him as the instrument through  which his thoughts, emotions, and even his desires are expressed. This  role I cherish, and it’s been mine and mine alone for over 20 years. I’m  not naïve – I know there have been others. Someone of his stature, of  his prowess, would never rely solely on one instrument to bear the fruit  of his innermost fears and desires. I’ve even had to bear the indignity  of sharing my space with them from time to time.

As long as he comes back to me, though, I know I’ll never hold it against him.

He  lifts the weight of my entire body with less effort that a bear would  use to lift a feather. He turns me, points me down, and lowers me until  my head touches the blank paper. We’ve done this dance time and time  again, his hand ready to guide me as I tell the world the brilliance  locked within the maze of his mind.

It’s  the same routine every time – as he’s a man for whom repetition is a  guiding principle. 13 sheets of college-ruled notebook paper are removed  from his desk, aligned edge-to-edge by tapping against the desk five  times. I’m removed from my case and placed parallel to the stack of  paper on the right with “one inch and no more” separating me from the  edge of the paper. Each item is removed in turn from the desktop, moving  to a predetermined place in his office. The “Don’t bother me until I’ve  had my coffee” mug, which hasn’t held actual coffee for years since he  quit the habit and instead holds his writing utensils, is moved to the  shelf on his immediate right. The daily calendar rests in the top drawer  of his desk. Various knickknacks and antiques move to placeholders  drawn in the dust from years of habit and routine. And finally, once  this procedure is complete, his desk transforms into my personal stage,  bare except for me and my canvas. Like an actress in a Broadway musical,  I’m prepared to deliver my aria.

Today,  on the cusp of another writing session, I’m reminded of why I don’t  mind the presence of other ink pens in the mug: whenever he reaches into  the bottom drawer of his desk, pulls out the college-ruled paper to  weave another immersive tapestry of dialogue and prose, he *always*  reaches for me. “Old Faithful”, he says each time he pulls me from my  case. As part of the routine, the words are expected… even still, they  fill me with a warmth only matched by the feeling of his hand around me.

This  is how we’ve started the process whenever he’s used me to put his  genius on paper for the world to behold. And here we are again, poised  to create another work of art.

*I’m ready.*

What  will it be today? Are we diving into the depths of some underwater  utopia? A world in which he will kill off some important figurehead and  set off events that lead to the end of their civilization?

Or  maybe we’ll traverse the wilds of Africa, telling the tale of a man who  felt like he’s being followed… only to realize too late that it wasn’t a  lion following him but a human seeking sport and sustenance?

Or could it be…

*Wait.*

Something’s different today. He’s not writing.

*But I’m ready. I’m always ready.* *Use me to bring your brilliance to life!*

He knows this. Today though, he hesitates.

*No…*

*He isn’t just hesitating. He’s actually* ***unsure*** *of what to write.*

This  never happens; well, almost never. He hasn’t had an issue allowing his  thoughts to flow through me since the Great Writer’s Block of ’93 – when  he went 4 weeks and 3 days without scrawling a single word, not with me  or any of the other pens kept in his desk (the mug was used for coffee  in the old days, we stayed in his desk). I remember it well, as it’s the  reason he has adhered so rigidly to ritual; since that episode of  Writer’s Block, he became superstitious and worried that it would return  if he broke even slightly from tradition and routine.

It  was also the first (and only) time that he has thrown me – the small  hole on the wall still remains as a tribute to the anger and frustration  of that day. I wasn’t upset, I never get upset at him – if I could  sacrifice myself to help him in his time of need, I am more than happy  to do so.

I also remember it vividly for what came out *after* the block cleared. It was his best writing up until that point (or since).

***A Masterpiece!***

***Once in a Generation!***

***Must-Read!***

(At least that’s what the critical reviews plastered on the front of the many copies kept in the office say.)

Actually, the more I think about it, the more excited I become. This *must*  be a sign of things to come, a portent of greatness ready to burst  forth – his mind brimming with so many great ideas that he’s not sure  which to let out first.

I can feel it, the excitement. His hand is shaking, trembling with anticipation. He wants to let the words out, they must be *right there*.

*Whenever you’re ready, I’m here.* *No rush, we have all the time in the world.*

We sit in this deadlock for 3 minutes, 43 seconds. His trembling hand gripping me, my head pressed against the paper.

My  building excitement is interrupted by a slight concern: the paper is no  longer clean (I’ve made a slight mess on the top sheet, but I couldn’t  help it with his trembling excitement). I hope I haven’t ruined the  moment as I did years ago when my pre-writing excitement was so great  that I leaked ink on the stack of paper before I even touched down. I  was cleaned and put away, and other pens were used for some time. Those  are days I don’t much enjoy recalling.

Yet,  he’s not upset, nor does he put me (or the paper) away. In fact, it  doesn’t seem like he’s even noticed, and – given that he’s a very  particular man, unwavering in his adherence to procedure and ritual – I  can tell that something is different today.

I  notice this difference not only in his ignorance of my grave solecism,  or because of his quivering hands, but also in the look on his face.  Whenever he writes, there has always been a glimmer in his eyes. Like a  mischievous adolescent who just devised a dangerous and filthy  experiment in his backyard laboratory, ready to put his plan into motion  regardless of the consequences. That devious joy, that spark, seems to  be missing today. Where is it, I wonder…

*Oh wait, I’m finally moving*.

It begins, and I no longer have time to ponder trivialities.

“***To***”  is all I get to spell out before I’m once again stopped, my tip slowly  bleeding ink through the paper in a growing blue stain. His hand begins  to shake again, but this pause isn’t as long – 15 seconds at most.

(You  become quite good at things like keeping track of precise measures of  time while sitting in a dark office in a coffee mug that no longer holds  coffee.)

“… ***whoever finds this letter***\*,\*”  he continues, and I can see how this is shaping up. While he rarely  writes happy stories, especially in the last 5 years or so, there are  times when he truly gets into the depths of human emotion, the sadness  that comes only from the pain of loss – or worse, the pain of never  knowing loss. Just as Michelangelo studied cadavers to improve his  depictions of human anatomy, so too did my owner study pain and  heartache to become the master at depicting such emotions through prose.

Though, unlike the master Renaissance artist, this artist did not always choose these lessons.

It  seems we are working on a somber tale today. Maybe a Dear John Letter?  Perhaps the letter’s author is a castaway who made it to a deserted  island? Who is the character, and why are they starting their letter  addressing someone unknown?

I  dutifully outline his thoughts and vision, telling the story of a man  who holds the same profession as my owner – an author, someone who is  world-renowned for his penmanship. As he moves me along the paper, I  continue to get more anxious and excited – his best stories have always  come from a place of knowledge and experience.

And oh, how he knows depression and sadness. It’s how he gets the details of human emotion so perfect in his writing.

I  can’t shake the nagging thought, however, that something is still  different. From the lack of concern over spilled ink to the shaking that  still has not subsided, *something’s off*.  I am still writing, but my letters and words are not as smooth and  artful as the usual steady strokes of cursive that he has used to craft  so many stories over the years.

On  top of that, today’s writing is slow and deliberate – whereas it’s  usually fast-flowing and follows his stream of consciousness. He’s  methodical today, incredibly precise with his words. He’s even… doubtful  of his own thoughts; he’s crossed a word or two out, something I’ve  never seen him do.

(Typically,  when he errs to the point of needing a correction, the whole sheet of  paper is binned, a new sheet rising to the top of the stack – with a  fresh sheet added to the bottom to ensure continuity of routine – and  the entire page restarted anew.)

Also,  it has not escaped my attention that the two splotches of ink where I  rested for extended periods of time go unnoticed as well. Or, if they  have been noticed, they are not bothering him.

Which *is* bothering *me*. What is on his mind?

This  must be a new routine, a new process replacing old ritual. But I don’t  understand why he would need a new routine, the old one has served him  so well.

As I continue to glide  across the paper, my ink brings to life the musings of a character who’s  been criticized for their work: their stories. A character who doesn’t  feel appreciated or loved by those around him.

While this is not a character that he’s written about in the past, he *has*  written about the weight of criticism and doubt on a man’s psyche. I  know that this is something he can write about with extensive experience  as criticism has dogged him for years.

The  best part, though, is that these stories always have a heroic turn  where the protagonist defies his critics and, by the end, everyone sees  him for the genius he really is.

And  yet, even this doesn’t reassure me for long, as I can tell that the  main character in today’s writing differs from the usual: this character  seems to have accepted that his work isn’t good enough. That his best  isn’t good enough, that *he’s* not good enough.

I’m having a hard time grasping the meaning behind the difference in today’s writing. Something is off.

Ok,  it’s a new routine, so it must mean a new type of story… the publisher  must have really gotten to him this time. (I know how he hates it when  they try to change his stories. I have felt that frustration in the past  through the tight grip on my frame and the roughness with which he  presses my head to the paper as he re-writes work that was already  perfect in my eyes.)

We continue:

***I  always thought that everyone would miss me when I was gone, that you  would all see the brilliance once you no longer had it available.*** ***I can see now that this isn’t true, that you’ve been right all along about me.*** ***That the world would be better off without me.***

While  my owner’s usual characters never display this type of defeated and  downtrodden attitude, we have written about someone who succumbed to the  relentless pressures of depression and self-doubt. His third *New York Times* Bestseller, *Pride is a Wound that Festers*,  was about a woman’s cognitive dissonance between the outward display of  pride and self-assuredness against immense doubt and self-loathing  within. That one ended with the main character taking her own life…

I wonder if that’s where this new story is headed.

*Wait a second…*

***I’ve been sitting here, alone, for the past 5 days in my apartment***\*…\*

As I watch the words form, I realize that he’s *really*  writing from experience – he’s been alone in the apartment for days  now. No one has visited, not even Joanne, who has spent many nights in  the house over the past year.

In  fact, I haven’t seen or heard her in weeks. I always liked how she read  the stories aloud when he showed them to her. I also liked the smile on  his face, and the look of hopeful enthusiasm he looked at her with when  she read his masterpieces.

I wonder when she’ll visit next.

\*…\****you don’t want me here anymore.*** ***No one does***…

This story does feel like it’s headed for the same ending as *Pride is a Wound that Festers*.  I wonder how the publisher will feel about two stories with the same  ending, especially since they’re making him change his entire routine.

I  wonder how many re-writes he’ll be required to do. The thought of being  used for multiple re-writes, even though I know they’ll frustrate him,  excites me.

In fact, I get so excited that I leak a thick line of extra ink onto the page.

*Oh*

*No…*

Look at what I’ve done. *This* will assuredly cause a furious crumpling of the page and a new sheet started.

*But wait…*

*He’s not stopping.*

He’s still writing as if he doesn’t notice. How could he not notice??

*Oh crap.*

If he doesn’t stop soon, his hand will rub across my mess and stain both his hand and the story.

*Please stop!*

*Please…*

I watch as his hand pushes through the mound of ink, leaving a blue streak across the page.

*That’s it, we’re done for the day.* *He won’t want to write any more after that.*

Yet, to my utter shock… he continues to write unimpeded by this seemingly insurmountable interruption.

*What is going on with him today?*

*…****the years of drinking, drugs, self-indulgence that led me down a path of self-destruction****…*

If  he’s trying to make the author of this letter sound like himself, he’s  doing a great job. Almost… too good of a job. I hope he adds in a detail  or two that show that the character isn’t *actually* him.

Or,  at the very least, I hope he snaps out of the near trance-like state  he’s in and starts acting normal. He never actually stops to clean my  mess – he presses on, forming more and more of this letter that sounds  increasingly depressing with each sentence. I am forming the words, one  by one, and while I do see the distinct resemblance between this  character and my owner, I do not understand where he’s going with this  story.

Though surely, if he is  modeling a character after himself, that character will defy all odds,  critics, and his own doubts to win the day. That’s just what he does.  That must be where this is headed.

So why does this feel so similar to *Pride is a Wound that Festers*?

\*…\****I have no idea who will find me or this letter***…

I have no idea where this is one is going. Well, I have a clue, but it’s not something I’m willing to entertain.

*…****and while this isn’t your fault, Joanne, you were the last hope I had for a happy ending****…*

He  never includes names of people from his personal life in his work – the  presence of Joanne only enhances the growing fear to near panic levels.

*What is he doing?* *What is this?*

I  need to just let his genius play out on the page to see where this is  going. This isn’t the first sad story he’s written, and it won’t be the  last.

*It won’t…*

*…****and after this is all over****…*

I  wish I could say that I’m not giving in to the building concern right  now, that I am not reading the entirety of his letter again and again  with increasing anxiety each time. I wish I could.

But this is the only owner I’ve known, the only hand that’s ever held me.

*Please tell me that this is just incredibly realistic writing from him.*

I mean, he *is* a master storyteller; this must be him in the zone, doing what he does best.

*This is just a story.*

\*…\****I  realize after writing all of this that it’s just another example of  what you’ve all been telling me: another act of self-centeredness,  making it all about me.*** ***I’m so sorry, I can’t stop myself.*** ***Well, I guess I can.*** ***And I will.*** ***You won’t have to deal with me any longer, I will take away the frustration I’ve caused forever.*** ***You’ll all wake up better off tomorrow.***

***Goodbye, I hope this eases your burdens a bit.***

Please  tell me it’s just a story. What would ease their burdens? Who are these  other characters? I need to know more, I need him to keep writing, I  need…

*No, it’s done.*

I  can tell that he’s done, his grip on me loosens whenever he decides to  stop writing. If I breathed air, I’m sure I would be hyperventilating at  this point. But, I’m sure I’m just overthinking this.

Next, he’ll put me back in my case.

Back into the mug.

The mug put back in its spot.

Then, he’ll… *wait, what is he doing?*

He  just… dropped me. On the desk. I’m not even parallel to the paper  stack… he just dropped me to fall where ever gravity and random chance  deemed appropriate and got up.

He’s walking away.

He’s not putting anything back where it goes. What is he doing?? Where is he going???

168,Michael-i_i-Huang,1613696256,"The flames gashing its little body into black glitters, rising and blowing away through the heat. It soon become an unrecognizable pile of dust, and disappeared from the earthly world.

It was thanksgiving when I met it for the first time. It's body was small, and it was full of life. It was a little mantis, twitching its body like a gentleman, hanging upside down on the wall. Its's eyes were bright, and its claws were strong and tight. One of its antennas was missing, must had been through a terrible fight.

Let's call it Jim.

Jim is a femal praying mantis. They got quite hard to find in the wild these days. So I took Jim with me from a country public house to a heavier city home. Jim of course fought back, and made another good fight with my pale fingers despite me being however many times size of it. I caged him in a bottle, and journeyed it with me home. 

Jim didn't seems quite happy with his clear container. Its feet was strong enough to carry it on the side of the wall, and it hanged down from the roof. I put it beside my pillow and watched it to sleep, admiring its beauty. Its movements are gentle enough to make a good study book out of it. Jim didn't understand the existence of clear substances. So it continued on knocking on the acrylic pannels, performing an unenjoyable song, and then clean its tiny fists when it got tired. It looked curious and passionate, but I could not figure out what is driving it now, weather its full of passionate and thoughts or full of hate.

\-

Jim according to the book won't live pass the winter. That did not stop Jim from living. I had to went out in the field weekly to feed it the freshest crickets. Jim was a cold blooded hunter, locking its eyes on the victim as soon as they enter its little territory, and clamps them hard and tight, gushing them open and eat the lives out of them. It was a fast and precise hunter, too. When Jim finishes the food, it will wipe its face clean, then taste the tip of his claws again, then stay there for a moment, weather remembering the taste, or thinking of something deeper. I can't figure out.

Time flies and Christmas came. Jim stayed active and healthy, putting me to sleep everynight with the sound it makes. Weather it's knocking its anger into the acrilic walls, or still learning their existence. I can't figure out. It's expiration date has already passsed, but Jim looked nothing different from the time of my capture, and was still putting on good fights with me if I dare to touch it. It flashes its bright yellow wings, making itself bigger in size, and punch me with consistant strikes and dodges my touch. It had always able to lock its sights on my finger, but never looked me in the eyes. 

Jim had lost some of its feets. They dried out without both of us' noticing. But the day after, they were missing already. Jim didn't care. It just falls down more often, and sometimes require my assistance to get it up. It became slower as well. It became very hard to find live crickets for Jim outside, so I bought him pet store crickets. Jim ate them with no difference, but sometimes starting to give me that curious look. It stopped knowcking on the acrylic pannel one day. 

I moved to a different house. I took Jim with me. My new home was colder, and I got busy with myself so much that I sometiems forgot to feed Jim. Then I wake up in the middle of the night, checking if Jim is okay,then feed it a cricket. Jim of course, never spoke a word, but became more often focusing its eyes on mine. I can't figure out what it's thinking. Maybe Jim thinks that I am its next dish.

&amp;#x200B;

Things are getting worse. There came a rare winter storm on Valentine's day, and it snowed for the first time here. The snow was thick, and I brought some for Jim. Jim didn't like it as much as I did. Then the power went out all of a sudden, and it was colder than ever. I've had Jim for three months now. The day after, still no power. I sat down and start to read a book, and that's when I saw Jim looking at me. It have not had food for a few days, and I cannot find a petstore that still stays open. I looked back at Jim, and Jim continues to stare at me. Jim never moved its eyesights away from me. Hours after hours, it was still looking at me. I can't figure out what its thinking. Is Jim craving for food? Is Jim expressing some form of emotions? I can't tell! It just look me straight in the eyes, looking like its reading my thoughts instead. I finally decided to go to bed, and left Jim in the darkness. The quite air had spread all across the entire room. 

I felt very sorry for Jim, that I cannot get any food for it. Jim is so slow now, and starting to look like an Alzheimer victim. It lost its balance, its speed, and the gentleness. It was struggling even to get up. I started thinking if it would have been better to leave Jim where it was back in the thanksgiving. It might have died a long time ago, I thought. At least that way I won't be thinking about Jim!

The next day, I took Jim out of the cage. I put it beside some plants in the room and let it go wherever it want. Jim seemed very exciting, tumbling and using all the speed it had left to explore this little flower vase. After a while, he hanged himself upside down on a sheet of leaf, and settled. Maybe it was not excited, for its stomach is flat like a sheet of paper, and it was tripping into the grass looking for the nonexisting food. I left it where it is. Jim gave me the last look before I left it, and tried to punch my finger again - which it almost fall off the leaf and did not succeed- then stopped moving. I can't figure out what Jim is thinking.

Jim was not moving at all when I came back. I got very worried and grabed it off the leaf. Jim had fell into an everlasting coma. Its legs were twitching, along with those brave fists. Its head was not turning, and its whole body shivered together. It was tiny. I carried Jim downstairs, to where the furnance was glowing. The fire was blazing hot, Jim's body is small and cold. I laid Jim in front of the furnance. Jim tried the last time to move its legs, and its fists, and its stomach, even flater. I can't help Jim anymore. It had lost the ability to eat, or drink, even if there is food. No power in the room still. No power in Jim. No power in my heart. 

I lifted Jim gently, for the last time, admiring its beauty, its skinny, gentle, detailed body. Then I flew Jim into the fire. 

The flame gashing its little body into black glitters, rising and flying away with the heat. Good bye Jim. 

Maybe I was a cold blooded hunter. Maybe I was worst than Jim. I feel sorry for Jim. I still can't fiture what Jim was thinking, and I shall never can.

170,AnomalyCroissant,1613693264,"It all started one night when I was sitting in the living room in the dark on my phone. My mom and sister were asleep in the bedroom together (we live in a one bedroom apartment on the second floor so I sleep on the couch in the living room). I was watching episodes of an old cartoon on my phone and was planning to go to bed shortly afterwards. Then suddenly the fire alarm had went off, and it was super loud. At first I thought it was just the video I was watching because I had my headphones on, but when I took them off I realized it was the real fire alarm, and it was loud af. My first reaction was just “.... Ok”, I kinda just thought that it was a false alarm that accidentally went off and that it would go off shortly because that’s happened before. 

It had woken my mom and sister up and they were confused. We were just standing around for a moment waiting when it wouldn’t go off and it kept going. Then my mom figured that we have to go out because some other people were. But what really sucked about that was the fact that it was freezing outside with snow/ice everywhere, and it was midnight which made it worse. Like we were all tired and we had to go out into the cold. So we got dressed and headed out to where we then just sat in the car for warmth and waited until it turned off. Other people were coming out too with their children and pets; wrapped in blankets and such. Then a fire truck came, and two came out and walked towards the building. 

They came back out and after that the alarm stopped and we were able to go back inside. So we got back inside, got back into our PJ’s, and just as we finished getting undressed and were about to go back to bed, the power had cut off right then and there. I mean what are the odds? This was one unlucky night. And it wasn’t just us, it was pitch black as far as the eye could see. We had started setting up candles for lights, chilled for a bit getting over the situation, and then just went to bed. The next day was just boring. Thing is our heater was broken even before the power outage, and since it was cold outside that of course effected the house. 

We literally had to wear our jackets and gloves in the house like we would outside. We looked out the window and saw a bunch of people leaving the complex. Wondering where they were going my mom decided we should go out too just to see what’s going on, and see how the town is. First we got some gas, and then we drove around town to see if anything was open. We went to Walmart and there was a long line in front of the entrance. They had put a limit on who could enter, so we ditched that. 

We passed Popeyes and figured maybe we could get some hot food, but there was a super long line there that went all the way out onto the road. So we ditched that too and just had to eat whatever was in the house to our disappointment. Later we found out that they had turned the water off too, so now we had no power and no water. For most of the day we just did absolutely nothing. My mom and sister slept, and I just sat on the couch staring into space, and then looked out the window eating teddy grams watching other people outside. 

That day was just a whole lot of nothing and trying to find things to do. It was the pinnacle of my boredom. Towards the night we had all came into the living room and just sat and had a conversation. Or at least my mom and sister did, I just sat there with them listening to them like a statue. They were going over an old picture gallery of my mom’s old memories, and then just generally talked about anything. Then at 10:45pm just as we were about to sleep, the power had suddenly came back on out of nowhere. My sister was like “Mom! Mom! Look!” and they both came out yelling and excited (my mom was literally pogging lol). 

We all immediately got on our phones and started doing a bunch of things. We thought the power was finally back for good and everything was back to normal. I read a manga on my phone and then went to bed relieved. Then yesterday morning I woke up, noticed the oven and microwave clock didn’t have any times and thought “You gotta be fucking kidding me”. There was supposed to be a Nintendo Direct airing at 4pm yesterday and I was excited for that the night before, and thought now I was gonna miss it which was the main reason I was upset. I asked my mom from the couch for confirmation, and it was true, the power had turned back off at 3:15am. 

Then once again we spent the whole day doing practically nothing. We started setting up new ways to do things like use the bathroom and such since there was no water or power. Let me tell you, our bathroom STUNK. It was nothing but shit and piss piled up in the toilet because we couldn’t flush it. My mom even had to put an inscent in there just to mask the smell. Because of that we were even about to start pooping in the trash can dog style whenever we had a #2, because we couldn’t keep using the toilet as the space was filling up. 

We started getting worried and wondered just how long this was gonna go on for. I mean how were we supposed to survive? We couldn’t keep living like this forever. Later that afternoon the service for our phones had came back, albeit very poor. And I was actually able to watch the Direct, although only bits and pieces because the quality was bad and it was buffering a lot. But I was able to see that and at that point I was happy. Earlier I was also able to still text my friend as well. 

Then later that night the power had suddenly came back on again and my mom and sis had once again got hyped. We immediately rushed to our phones to charge them. But then after like 2 minutes it cut back off again to our frustration. But then yet again after a few minutes it came back on. Though this time we lowered our expectations and didn’t get excited at all as we didn’t know what was going on or how long it would last. But then it stayed.. and it stayed! The next thing you know we finally had power again! I woke up today expecting the power to be off again like before but it was still on.

The story is about almost having sex, so there are sexual situations involved. I was a Preacher's kid, and as a result, take a fair amount of shots at Hipochristianity. There is also a dog involved, but no in a sexual or christian sort of way.\*\*

TL;DR - Yep, it's long. WritingPrompts has a weekly theme ""Foolishness"" that I submitted a story for. It involved nudity and an attempt at first time sex - as well as a villain wearing pee stained whitey tighties. I also lampooned the church and christians. It was a true story from my youth and it got me permanently banned from the sub.

Disclaimer: This story is closely based on an actual event. It was presented in spoken word at a local meet up based on Moth, but it fits the theme, so I thought I would write it out and share it here. Honestly, it could probably go under TIFU as well, but , let's see how it plays in front of this rarefied audience.

“If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended, that you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear. And this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but a dream, gentles, do not reprehend: If you pardon we will mend. Else the Puck a liar call.” - Bill the Bard

THE MOPED INCIDENT

When I was 15, I bought a moped. It was kind of a big deal for me. We lived in the outskirts of a backwater small town, well, it was more of a small city, but when the population is less that 30,000, do the distinctions really matter all that much? I used the money I had been saving since I started working on the Jones Dairy farm at age 11. It wasn't much, but it was mine.

That dumb thing offered me the ability to reach other parts of town without arriving three hours after I had started, covered in sweat or mud or both. It lengthened my leash, which was sort of a big deal when you're 15 and your nearest neighbors were cows. You see, I was an adopted only child and my parents were deeply religious. Sometimes, the suggestion that I spend more time with my best buddy Jesus just rang hollow. The dog was better company.

I used my new mobility to play DND with a group of friends from school and to go to swim team – without having to endure the radio praise hour (which seemed to be on all day). Now, you have to understand, DND was considered borderline Satan Worship by my parents. It had all of the necessary elements for demonic possession – dice, imagination, art that didn't feature Jesus, women with roles outside of the home... it was a veritable cesspool. It didn't have dancing, but we were working on that.

One Sunday, a new girl showed up at Dad's church. He was the pastor, so, while I guess it was Jesus's Church, Dad ran the place. She was really cute, in a redneck kinda way, but when your exposure to girls is as limited as mine was, you're willing to overlook a lot. We started passing notes. (For many of you reading this, let me explain that last bit – back before cell phones, before the Internet – if you wanted to have a discrete conversation with someone, you would write out  your message on a small scrap of paper, fold it several times, and then hand it to them. It was texting, but without a phone.)

One day Deidre passed me a not with a map to her house, instructions on which window led to her bedroom, and what time her parents went to bed. I was a little confused by exactly what she meant by it, I hadn't even kissed a girl, so I had very little to go on. I asked the guys from DND the next day at school. They explained that it was an invitation to have sex (probably) and to at least kiss...who knew?  

I was a little frantic. I had no idea who any of this was supposed to work. I couldn't ask my parents – I mean, come on, they were really religious – as in met in seminary – religious. And, they had to adopt. It was a fair bet that they had no idea how sex worked either, and if they did, they were probably doing it wrong.  

I asked one of the older farm hands at the Dairy. Toby was happy to explain everything to me. But, I've got to admit, the instructions were a lot to keep track of without context or drawings or photos and his focus on particular elements of the act were distorting pretty much everything. The instructions were less than clear – helpful, but unclear – and cut short since Toby go so worked up just talking about it that he had to go jerk off behind the barn.

I watched a lot of racy TV that week to try to put things into some sort of meaningful order, but all that was available was Fantasy Island and Love Boat, so, not really helpful. The one thing that I carried away from all of it was that I probably needed condoms and a bottle of wine. I stole a bottle of communion wine from the church. I had no idea what I was supposed to do with the condoms, but if Toby could figure it out, it couldn't be all that complicated.

On the appointed night, I climbed out of my window, jumped on the moped, strapped on a back pack with the wine, and headed off into the night. I was so nervous that I was shaking. The house I was going to felt like it was halfway across the county, also on the outskirts of town, but on the other side. Honestly, it was about a 30 mile ride. I got there, but damn.  

I decided to hide the moped behind a bush between Diedre's house and the neighbor's. It wasn't viable from the road and if things went sideways, it was easily accessible. I left the keys in it, gathered a few small rocks, and went to the appointed window. Rock 3 got a response.

Deidre had already removed the window screen and  gestured for me to climb up. As I got a hand on the ledge, a large white German Shepard rounded the corner and grabbed my trailing leg. I managed to shake him off, but he took my shoe as a prize, and began gnawing on it just below the window – waiting for another shot.

Deidre had a lot more experience with all of this than I did, and after she realized that, things stopped being quite so fumbly and really started going somewhere. Pretty quickly we were both naked and figuring out how far we wanted to go with all of this and how best to get there. Honestly, I was a bit awestruck by how effortless all of this was for her.

Just then, disaster struck. Diedre's uncle lived next door and was a second shift foreman at the local wire plant. Headlights played across the room as he turned into the driveway next door.  

“Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck. He's going to see the moped.” I began scrambling to get my clothes together.  

“Shush, He ain't gonna see shit, he's probably already started drinkin. You climb back up here. I want you to lick my pussy.”  

Well. Lick her pussy? People do that? I mean, she's the one who knows what the hell we're doing here. Sounds...fun? I climbed back into the bed and got into position. There was hair on it, not a lot, but some. More than I had at the time. The smell was different. Strong, but warm, not unlike the way my cat's fur smelled when he decided that he was feeling affectionate. Maybe that's why it's called a pussy? I'll have to look into that one.  The taste was musky, but it had a sweetness to it, definitely an acquired taste, but it was better than beer? So, not so bad? I was nose deep when the house phone rang.

I heard a bed creak several rooms away. I rolled off the bed and started shoving clothes into my backpack. No time to get dressed.  

Footsteps thudded down the hall, past the door we were behind. “Jesus, Christ, the whole house is shaking, this guy sounds like he's a giant.” I got the last of my clothes in the bag and rolled under the bed.

“Damnit, who is this? You know what time it is?”

The voice matched the footsteps. This guy had to be 300lbs if he was an ounce.

“Mo Ped? I don't know nuthin 'bout no Got Damn Mo Ped. Prowler? Huh. I'll check.”  

The phone rattled back into the cradle. The footsteps returned and the bedroom door opened. “Diedre, you know anythin bout a Mo Ped...Why ain't you got no clothes on?”

“Well daddy, I got hot.”

“What the... Mutha Fucker...”

A ham sized fist closed of the one part of me no hidden under the bed – my left ankle – and I was snatched unceremoniously from my hiding place. Blinking up at the light from the floor, I was completely overshadowed by a huge man who could have easily been a bit actor in Bravehart or any movie about the Scottish clans. He was wearing whitey tighties with a small pee stain on the front that looked like it was regularly freshened up with each wearing. He was huge. He looked down at me, clad in terror and a condom, and said, “Don't you fuckin move, I'm callin the law.”

I may be a fool, but I wasn't his fool. I grabbed the backpack and dove head first out the window.

There are a lot of things in a dog's life that are pretty predictable. Dinner time. The Mail Man. The school bus. The high entertainment value of another dog's butt hole...But naked flying teenagers who land on you at 1am as you're gnawing on a shoe? Nah.  Faced with this highly unpredictable and unexpected and startling event, the dog dropped the shoe and went yelping off around the back side of the house.

I grabbed my shoe and stuffed it into the pack as I ran for the moped. I popped the helmet on, got the pack situated, turned the key, gave it a kick and roared off down the road. At that moment, I was feeling pretty good about my chances.  Now I just needed to find a place to stop and get dressed.

I looked back over my shoulder. The fucking dog was back in the the game. He wasn't all that far behind me and I couldn't seem to out run him. “What the hell, is this fucking Rin Tin Tin?” Just then, the sound of F350 roared to life. Big, diesel, carrying a huge man with a ginger beard and pee stained underwear. “Fuck.”

I needed to find a place to hide, but this was out in the middle of nowhere. No side roads to speak of, just barbed wire and pastures and cows...and a fucking mutant super dog leading a giant white truck carrying my doom. Death rode that pale horse.

Think, think, think. There has to be a way to get off this road and lose Mountain McPeestain. I can deal with the dog by itself, but both of them? I'm so fucked. Just then I saw a dirt side road, single lane, almost overgrown by privet. I pulled the fuse to the lights and turned onto it. I was looking back over my shoulder for the dog when I crashed into the Sheriff's Deputy's car. He had been taking a nap until I flew headlong onto his hood, rolled up onto the windshield, and lay there, clad in a helmet, a backpack and a condom.  

The dog arrived a few minutes later, Mountain McPeestain shortly behind – obviously following the dog. I scrambled up on the roof, hissing like a cornered cat. I was actually pretty thankful for the deputy at that moment, because Mountain got out of the truck carrying the biggest Dirty Harry gun I had ever seen.

I went to jail. Dad got called. So many dumb jokes about “Safety First”...

Mountain wanted me charged with rape, but Deidre was 16, I was 15, so they dropped that one pretty quickly. Burglary? Nope, she let me in. Breaking and Entering was dropped for the same reason. Criminal Trespass? The house lacked signs – and I was invited. It went on for an hour.

I got three weeks probation for public indecency. The judge couldn't quit laughing.

Dad sold the moped and used the money to buy bibles in English for small heathen children in Uganda. I tried to point out that bibles in English wouldn't help his cause and would probably be used as tinder or toilet paper, that quip got me a beating.

Have any of you even encountered one before if not let me tell these things are not like how google or any of pictures you find depicts them at least not right away... 

Iets get into it I'm from Canada and I live on a reserve that's about 30 minutes from any town relatively close compared to other places I've been.

Well its the end of December and just getting finished with holidays and spending it relatively alone (thanks to covid). I get a call from one of my friends he wants to go hunting, well that's kind of a problem cause I've never shot a gun or went hunting befor. Pretty pathetic for a native American if you ask me, but anyways he tells me he just needs my eyes and another set of legs to help carry what ever he catches. So I agree making one of the biggest mistakes I would come to regret.

So he picks me up in his crappy old Ford truck he uses for hunting, tells me we are going deep into the Bush and well find a spot to camp along the way. So we drive about 20 minutes into the woods following what little road is left and we get to a point where we have to continue on foot, we unload our gear and supplies and carry it till we find a nice clearing with room for everything after we. After we set up camp we begin our trek into the woods going farther then I had gone befor, saw a couple of bucks and rabbits nothing to spectacular, so we keep looking cause he wants the big daddy buck and we come to this other clearing much much larger then the one we are camping at and something about this part of the woods just feels off. 

It had a heavy feeling to like the air was thick and just had a disorienting aura about this place. But we hadn't caught anything yet and we're getting hungry, so we spot a rabbit in the middle of this clearing buddy lines up the shot and BAM we have dinner, so being the one with out the gun I go to get our little dinner in the middle of this clearing and I notice something odd that its a perfect circle, no tree stumps, no sign that any human had made this gigantic circle, I also happen to notice what look like claw Marks on the trees surrounding the area. Buddy said it's from bears sharping their claws and marking territory but the marks were soo deep into the trees it seemed off. 

Anyways it's dark out now and we are back at our camp sight eating and talking about how crazy this pandemic shit is. I also brought up the clearing we were at and how weird it felt to me, I wanted to know if he felt like that too or if I was just exaggerating (my anxiety makes me do that sometimes). To which he said ""yeah"" he noticed the change in the air too and said it made him feel dizzy and worn out but he also said it just could of been from the long day we had, so on that note it was time for bed, we both slept in same tent (it's the middle of winter and bundling up can only do so much plus he was like a brother to me so not a big deal). It had to be around 1AM when we both woke up to sound of the most horrible scream I'd ever herd. 

""What that fuck was that"" was my first though, I'm guessing my friend was thinking the thing as he looked at me with fear on his face, I know because I was afraid too. So he grabs his gun loads a round and we just sit there for a while and listen, now I know my friend is at least safe hes got a gun but I have nothing. Fear and my anxiety start getting the better of me so I ask ""wheres the hatchet we used to split wood"",
""Out there by the fire"" he said 
So I tell him I'm gonna open the tent grab the hatchet and when I jump in you seal the thing back up. 

I open the tent and as fast as I can bolt out to grab that hatchet, As I go to turn around with hatchet in hand I'm quickly greeted by my friend shoving me down by the back of my neck, he put his finger up to his mouth to tell me to be quiet and we listen,........ in the distance I can hear the slow sound of crunching snow and a faint high pitched guttural growl, now I'm in full panic mode, we dont even have to say anything to each cause we both know our hunting trip was over and it was time to leave. 

All we had to do was make it to the truck, 
In the dead of night, it sounded so easy. But it wasnt and I knew that from the moment my friend said ""I'm gonna fire a warning shot"", but before I could even open my mouth to tell him ""no"" it was too late, the shot rang in the distance and for a moment there was silence. Then we heard it,  a scream so soul piercing it felt like it lasted forever it definitely echoed much further then this gun shot did, it was petrifying I'd never heard such a haunting scream befor that I was literally frozen in fear. Then we could hear whatever made this scream was charging right for us with the sound of crunching snow getting closer and closer. We looked at each other and just ran in the direction of the truck, frantically sprinting calling out to each other to make sure the other hadn't fallen behind. ""We're almost there"" we kept telling each other as we are weaving threw trees making a B line to the truck, trying to ignore the sound of this growl that sounds like it's right in my ear, but I can see the truck were gonna make it, we're getting out of here. As we come up to the truck  my friend makes it to his side and unlocks both passenger and driver side at the same time. As I open the door he does to at the same time and then hes gone in a flash of white, this thing had gotten him, ran at him with such force that when it tackled him it shook the truck side to side. I stood there in shock, I call out to him but all i can hear are screams and a couple gun shots and then dead silence again. I know in my heart that my friend is dead and so am I if I dont get the fuck out of here, I go over to the driver side and find the keys on the ground he must of let them go when he got tackled. I hop in start the damn thing whip it around in the direction I need to to get out of here, then I saw it. 

Skin as white as snow, completley hairless, eyes that had sunken into its head made dark circles around eyes that were the just as white as its skin, no nose, teeth so jagged and sharp shined with the color of blood and its lips looked like they had been chewed off so all your staring at is teeth, its body was so disproportioned but with long lanky limbs. This thing is blocking me from leaving but I'm getting out of here no matter what, I floor it with the tires spinning I shoot forward and so does it, screaming that blood curdling scream as it charges at me. Now I'm getting up close and personal as this thing lunges at the truck and bounces of the hood and over top of the truck. As im speeding away I glance at the rear view mirror and witnessed this thing get up and just stand there watching me drive off with its head tilted slightly I knew I had just escaped death with the price of losing my friend.",stories,Wendigo Encounter,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lmx8ax/wendigo_encounter/,1613653529.0

176,tgmvii,1613674647,"Long ago, in a dark time, when the world was still edged by primal power, three ancient kings ruled over three ancient lands- Caledonia, Eire and Mercia.

The cold, sharp land of Caledonia lay to the north, punctured by crooked mountains and blasted by chilling winds, ruled by an old, crippled king. His once muscular, strong body, was now ravaged by the claws of time and ill living, as his clothes hung loosely from his skeletal frame and his greying hair spun wispily down, framing his pale skin- skin paler than any other. Dull patterned clothes hid the worst of the damage, but his eyes, in their cloudy stare, gave away the life he had chosen. His court would meet, argue over the best use of the lands resources, who should and shouldn’t be traded with, and the king would sit, not even listening to this tripe anymore. He felt hungry all the time, but his sickness left a hole he could not fill.

The verdant isle of Eire, green as emeralds, yet hazed in a limpness that subdued its prey, was presided over by a flame haired ruler. Still fresh enough to remember the eagerness of youth, and hungry enough to yearn for more power, he indulged his appetites. His belly had swollen, his skin had blemished, yet his eyes grasped for further power. His subjects had given more than they should have to him, yet he still asked them to provide. They found themselves on carts and foot, what little gold they had hidden, leaving the beautiful island as if a famine had struck, fleeing the diseased king.

The proud and large land of Mercia, awash with fields and forests, tainted by conflict and war. The king of this land was a tall, skinny man. A man whose crown sat crooked, yet in all royal paintings sat straight. His clothes elegantly woven, not a stitch out of place upon him. Youth was leaving him, but he held back the footsteps of time with clever creams and tonics prescribed by the loudest flatterers. However, these men and women easily grew tired, disillusioned with their king, and would replace themselves with more naive sycophants. The king pretended he didn’t notice this cycle but it gnawed at him in his bed at night. 

These three kings had held unsteady dominion over the three lands for some time, despite rebellion and resistance, despite unhappiness spreading like a disease, despite neither having any true claim to any throne. What they did have though was a secret, and each year they would adorn a disguise and meet in that empty tavern on the desolate roads just within the Land of the Red Dragon as you passed from Mercia, to renew their pledges- not pledges they had made to each other, but the pledges they made to that immoral spirit many years ago.  

The spirit didn’t have a name: not one you could guess anyway. It didn’t really have a body either, more of a radiance, yet with no warmth. A glimmering that almost sucked in light instead of emitting it. Each king had assumed they had come across it by chance, at completely different times in their lives. On his last legs, travelling the roads as a starving merchant, was how the man from the cold North had arrived. The boy with red hair evading capture for his many indecent crimes, searching for somewhere that his debtors wouldn’t search. Then there was the Mercian gentleman; he had taken work at a Baron’s estate but had found himself lost on his journey. 

Each had stopped at a tavern that had no patrons and sold no ale or food. What it did sell, or rather the spirit that inhabited it sold, was a dream. Each had asked for the same dream, to be a king, and so the spirit had granted it, but this spirit was a trickster. He hadn’t told them of the toll these dreams took, or the burdens they placed upon them. The spirit delighted in seeing them yearn for more and more power, never realising it. It giggled as he watched the daily proceedings of the royal court suck the delight from the position they governed; and it basked in the whispers that spread about the kings, the whispered that questioned, the whispers that grew louder and louder.
 
And so the kings would return, once a year, as that had been part of the deal they had struck in their desperation. They would beg the spirit for more, in hope that it would sate their ambitions, but little did they know, it was the spirit who grew richer. The spirit was nearly done with them. This would be their last year as kings and it would move on, as it had grown tired of its dealings with these greedy men. It too yearned- it desired more mischief-making and there was not much left to be taken from these poor fools. 

The spirit had a way of granting its wishes that the kings were not at best pleased of, but they entertained its wicked ways, as they knew the prize at the end of it was what they needed, like an addict needs a hit. Many years ago, before the two younger men had fallen into his web, the king from the north remembered the experience of having to loose arrows into the air in the hope that it didn’t descend and pierce his own skull before he could make his request. The spirit had taken supreme delight in that one- it had been very proud of itself when the Caledonian King had received a shaft to the backside as he screamed out for everlasting life. 

Nor would the King of the Island of Eire forget having traded some of his children for gems upon his rings. The spirit had bound them to his hands so that he could never remove them and had not told the king prior to the deal that it was the blood of those children that it would crush and petrify into the shimmering gems upon his fingers. For several years the king had worn gloves to hide his shame- the spirit had certainly found itself very clever for tricking the king so easily.
 
But the crooked dream the spirit most savoured was one of its cruelest. Little after it had made the Mercian man king of his country, he had married a young women, who had thrown herself at him. He had made the foolish mistake of boastfully bringing her with him. He wanted more gold, and the spirit could certainly provide that. Unfortunately, for the wife at least, he had asked for her weight in gold and this had brought a wry smile to the spirits hidden lips. The wife had felt very ill on the journey home, and the king rather upset, as no gold had appeared yet. Thus upon their return, he had sent her to a separate room so he could fester in his own unhappy greed. When he had woken, his servants were a fluster throughout his castle. They brought him to his wives room, only she wasn’t there anymore, instead, a solid golden figure of her lay in the bed, grimacing in pain. 

As always, the spirit waited for their arrival and as they gathered, it asked each what they desired, and, as always, the king of the Island of Eire spoke first. He begged for more gold, for his desire for gold was akin to dragon’s sickness, a great illness that afflicts the greedy and soulless. The spirit nodded and beckoned the king over to the edge of a river. He ushered the king towards a great cliff where the river descended over a slight waterfall into a crystalline lake. He told the king that he must ride over the edge within a barrel made of oak whilst calling for his heart’s desire. He would find what he was looking for on the banks of the lake. And so, knowing the spirits methods were odd, but sick with greed, he pushed the barrel to the water’s edge, climbed in and rocked himself into the flow. As the barrel plummeted over the edge he screamed for gold, barely audible over the thrashing of water on the rocks at the bottom. As he emerged, half drowned, he waded through thousands of golden coins that spilled from the shore into the meandering river. The banks glistened a golden light as he dragged chest after chest to lock up his prize. 

And so he loaded the great many chests brimming with gold onto his cart and led the horse away, a smile spread across his face. Unfortunately, as he made his way along the lonely dirt track, cart creaking under the weight of his treasure, sinister eyes fixed on him. They were the eyes of bandits, of cutthroats, and these eyes did not recognise this man as a king visiting a foreign land, they saw him as prey. The king bargained and pleaded for mercy, right up to his last blood gargled breath.

A short while later, the Caledonian king spoke with the spirit and, and being very unlike the other king, didn’t wish for mountains of gold- what he wanted was a way out. He knew the gifts he received preserved his unearthly life and wished for an end to his reign, a reign of blood and death. His body was feeble but his mind was far more broken. He should have died long ago as an old man, now he was a walking cadaver and he had no wish to carry on. He struggled to push another barrel to the river, begging with his eyes for help, but none was given. Eventually he pushed himself inside the wooden vessel he thought his last coffin, into the rapid flow of water, and as he went over the edge, he called out for silver to end his suffering. When he emerged, surprisingly, from the depths of the lake, wading through silver coins that burnt his skin, his pocket weighed him down. He placed his hand inside and pulled out a silver dagger, not embellished with jewels and finery, a simple silver silhouette, surely just the knife of a lowly servant. A tear emerged, camouflaged with the lake water dripping from his crown. He hadn’t shed tears for hundreds of years.

He twisted the blade in his hands as he racked his mind. He knew he had been tricked, he knew it all along really, but this latest piece of trickery plagued his mind as he sat in his carriage on his long journey home. He stroked the fine edges of the blade. He cursed the spirit as he heard its laughter in his ears. Yet when his carriage arrived back at his castle, the knife lay with droplets of blood along the blade and even in the cold Caledonian air, there was no misted breath from his lips for all that was left was a withered husk of a man with no sign of life. 

And so the final king, conversed with the spirit he had grown to know better than he did any subject or person who called themselves friend. He had thought long and hard, he had seen the greed of one king, and the depression of another. He yearned for something different though, he wanted acknowledgment. He had heard those whispers that come from hidden alcoves in his halls. He had watched as people pointed and sniggered. Now he would wish for something to truly make his title fit the man. And so he dragged the barrel to the river, and flung himself in. In his mind he had it, it was there ready to be called. But the rush and pull of the raging water dragged at him and his exhilaration took over. He found a smile grow on his face as he was tug to and fro, and he forgot his dream. Relinquishing control to his emotions, he cascaded down the waterfall, and with a great scream, he called out, ‘weeeeee’.",stories,"The Three Cursed Kings- a twist on a fairy story.

177,tgmvii,1613674186,"Long ago, in a dark time, when the world was still edged by primal power, three ancient kings ruled over three ancient lands- Caledonia, Eire and Mercia.
The cold, sharp land of Caledonia lay to the north, punctured by crooked mountains and blasted by chilling winds, ruled by an old, crippled king. His once muscular, strong body, was now ravaged by the claws of time and ill living, as his clothes hung loosely from his skeletal frame and his greying hair spun wispily down, framing his pale skin- skin paler than any other. Dull patterned clothes hid the worst of the damage, but his eyes, in their cloudy stare, gave away the life he had chosen. His court would meet, argue over the best use of the lands resources, who should and shouldn’t be traded with, and the king would sit, not even listening to this tripe anymore. He felt hungry all the time, but his sickness left a hole he could not fill.
The verdant isle of Eire, green as emeralds, yet hazed in a limpness that subdued its prey, was presided over by a flame haired ruler. Still fresh enough to remember the eagerness of youth, and hungry enough to yearn for more power, he indulged his appetites. His belly had swollen, his skin had blemished, yet his eyes grasped for further power. His subjects had given more than they should have to him, yet he still asked them to provide. They found themselves on carts and foot, what little gold they had hidden, leaving the beautiful island as if a famine had struck, fleeing the diseased king.
The proud and large land of Mercia, awash with fields and forests, tainted by conflict and war. The king of this land was a tall, skinny man. A man whose crown sat crooked, yet in all royal paintings sat straight. His clothes elegantly woven, not a stich out of place upon him. Youth was leaving him, but he held back the footsteps of time with clever creams and tonics prescribed by the loudest flatterers. However, these men and women easily grew tired, disillusioned with their king, and would replace themselves with more naïve sycophants. The king pretended he didn’t notice this cycle but it gnawed at him in his bed at night. 
These three kings had held unsteady dominion over the three lands for some time, despite rebellion and resistance, despite unhappiness spreading like a disease, despite neither having any true claim to any throne. What they did have though was a secret, and each year they would adorn a disguise and meet in that empty tavern on the desolate roads just within the Land of the Red Dragon as you passed from Mercia, to renew their pledges- not pledges they had made to each other, but the pledges they made to that immoral spirit many years ago.  
The spirit didn’t have a name: not one you could guess anyway. It didn’t really have a body either, more of a radiance, yet with no warmth. A glimmering that almost sucked in light instead of emitting it. Each king had assumed they had come across it by chance, at completely different times in their lives. On his last legs, travelling the roads as a starving merchant, was how the man from the cold North had arrived. The boy with red hair evading capture for his many indecent crimes, searching for somewhere that his debtors wouldn’t search. Then there was the Mercian gentleman; he had taken work at a Baron’s estate but had found himself lost on his journey. 
Each had stopped at a tavern that had no patrons and sold no ale or food. What it did sell, or rather the spirit that inhabited it sold, was a dream. Each had asked for the same dream, to be a king, and so the spirit had granted it, but this spirit was a trickster. He hadn’t told them of the toll these dreams took, or the burdens they placed upon them. The spirit delighted in seeing them yearn for more and more power, never realising it. It giggled as he watched the daily proceedings of the royal court suck the delight from the position they governed; and it basked in the whispers that spread about the kings, the whispered that questioned, the whispers that grew louder and louder. 
And so the kings would return, once a year, as that had been part of the deal they had struck in their desperation. They would beg the spirit for more, in hope that it would sate their ambitions, but little did they know, it was the spirit who grew richer. The spirit was nearly done with them. This would be their last year as kings and it would move on, as it had grown tired of its dealings with these greedy men. It too yearned- it desired more mischief-making and there was not much left to be taken from these poor fools. 
The spirit had a way of granting its wishes that the kings were not at best pleased of, but they entertained its wicked ways, as they knew the prize at the end of it was what they needed, like an addict needs a hit. Many years ago, before the two younger men had fallen into his web, the king from the north remembered the experience of having to loose arrows into the air in the hope that it didn’t descend and pierce his own skull before he could make his request. The spirit had taken supreme delight in that one- it had been very proud of itself when the Caledonian King had received a shaft to the backside as he screamed out for everlasting life. 
Nor would the King of the Island of Eire forget having traded some of his children for gems upon his rings. The spirit had bound them to his hands so that he could never remove them and had not told the king prior to the deal that it was the blood of those children that it would crush and petrify into the shimmering gems upon his fingers. For several years the king had worn gloves to hide his shame- the spirit had certainly found itself very clever for tricking the king so easily. 
But the crooked dream the spirit most savoured was one of its cruellest. Little after it had made the Mercian man king of his country, he had married a young women, who had thrown herself at him. He had made the foolish mistake of boastfully bringing her with him. He wanted more gold, and the spirit could certainly provide that. Unfortunately, for the wife at least, he had asked for her weight in gold and this had brought a wry smile to the spirits hidden lips. The wife had felt very ill on the journey home, and the king rather upset, as no gold had appeared yet. Thus upon their return, he had sent her to a separate room so he could fester in his own unhappy greed. When he had woken, his servants were a fluster throughout his castle. They brought him to his wives room, only she wasn’t there anymore, instead, a solid golden figure of her lay in the bed, grimacing in pain. 
As always, the spirit waited for their arrival and as they gathered, it asked each what they desired, and, as always, the king of the Island of Eire spoke first. He begged for more gold, for his desire for gold was akin to dragon’s sickness, a great illness that afflicts the greedy and soulless. The spirit nodded and beckoned the king over to the edge of a river. He ushered the king towards a great cliff where the river descended over a slight waterfall into a crystalline lake. He told the king that he must ride over the edge within a barrel made of oak whilst calling for his heart’s desire. He would find what he was looking for on the banks of the lake. And so, knowing the spirits methods were odd, but sick with greed, he pushed the barrel to the water’s edge, climbed in and rocked himself into the flow. As the barrel plummeted over the edge he screamed for gold, barely audible over the thrashing of water on the rocks at the bottom. As he emerged, half drowned, he waded through thousands of golden coins that spilled from the shore into the meandering river. The banks glistened a golden light as he dragged chest after chest to lock up his prize. 
And so he loaded the great many chests brimming with gold onto his cart and led the horse away, a smile spread across his face. Unfortunately, as he made his way along the lonely dirt track, cart creaking under the weight of his treasure, sinister eyes fixed on him. They were the eyes of bandits, of cutthroats, and these eyes did not recognise this man as a king visiting a foreign land, they saw him as prey. The king bargained and pleaded for mercy, right up to his last blood gargled breath.
A short while later, the Caledonian king spoke with the spirit and, and being very unlike the other king, didn’t wish for mountains of gold- what he wanted was a way out. He knew the gifts he received preserved his unearthly life and wished for an end to his reign, a reign of blood and death. His body was feeble but his mind was far more broken. He should have died long ago as an old man, now he was a walking cadaver and he had no wish to carry on. He struggled to push another barrel to the river, begging with his eyes for help, but none was given. Eventually he pushed himself inside the wooden vessel he thought his last coffin, into the rapid flow of water, and as he went over the edge, he called out for silver to end his suffering. When he emerged, surprisingly, from the depths of the lake, wading through silver coins that burnt his skin, his pocket weighed him down. He placed his hand inside and pulled out a silver dagger, not embellished with jewels and finery, a simple silver silhouette, surely just the knife of a lowly servant. A tear emerged, camouflaged with the lake water dripping from his crown. He hadn’t shed tears for hundreds of years.
He twisted the blade in his hands as he racked his mind. He knew he had been tricked, he knew it all along really, but this latest piece of trickery plagued his mind as he sat in his carriage on his long journey home. He stroked the fine edges of the blade. He cursed the spirit as he heard its laughter in his ears. Yet when his carriage arrived back at his castle, the knife lay with droplets of blood along the blade and even in the cold Caledonian air, there was no misted breath from his lips for all that was left was a withered husk of a man with no sign of life. 
And so the final king, conversed with the spirit he had grown to know better than he did any subject or person who called themselves friend. He had thought long and hard, he had seen the greed of one king, and the depression of another. He yearned for something different though, he wanted acknowledgment. He had heard those whispers that come from hidden alcoves in his halls. He had watched as people pointed and sniggered. Now he would wish for something to truly make his title fit the man. And so he dragged the barrel to the river, and flung himself in. In his mind he had it, it was there ready to be called. But the rush and pull of the raging water dragged at him and his exhilaration took over. He found a smile grow on his face as he was tug to and fro, and he forgot his dream. Relinquishing control to his emotions, he cascaded down the waterfall, and with a great scream, he called out, ‘weeeeee’.",stories,The Three Cursed Kings- A twist on a fairy story.

Any iOS users know what AirDrop is. If you don't, it's where you can send pictures to another iPhone without needing a phone number. Pretty cool, under the right circumstances of course.

As we all know from experience or seeing the memes, the back of the bus is a shithole. There's enough drugs back there that the DEA could raid it, and a lot of jerks. Anyway, one of the idiots back there thought it was funny to take a picture of a Muslim girl wearing a hijab on the bus, and edit the photo calling her a terrorist, suicide bomber, etc. You get it. They ended up sending the picture to the girl, who reported it to her older brother.

Her older brother walked onto the bus, and went to the back. He called out the idiots who made the pictures, told them to never do it again, and if they did, he'd kill them. And considering he had a muscular build and was at least 6 feet tall, he could.

183,Edict2040,1613668253,"Sometime in the future we are going to witness factory 101 built on the surface of the moon. There will not be a ceremonial stone laying or cutting of a ribbon, just a line of prefabricated modules – for ease of convenience lets envisage them as 20’ container size – dumped in prepared sites from an orbital sky crane type vehicle. Then, suitably suited and booted to survive the lunar surface a pair or maybe three engineers will do the spanner work, connecting the modules via a robust yet lightweight conveyor belt system at one end of which is ‘goods in’ and the other end ‘goods out’.

Between these two points there will need to be, in order, a crusher module, a milling module, and a screening module, and that is just to get the iron ore ready. Initially of course there are iron meteorites on the surface easily accessible for an initial supply. The first module delivery would need to include a pair of lunar dump trucks to go and retrieve fallen siderites but with approximately 5% of all lunar meteorites being iron based the quality of material would be very good from the start. Run the resulting fines through a magnetic separator (another module) and you have the raw material to make iron.

With easy rich pickings Factory 101 could soon be underway. Power would come from solar array with possibly a nuclear component to beef up electrical delivery. At least two modules dedicated to solar energy collection or nuclear energy would need to be added to the list, unpacked and plugged in. Still, there wouldn’t be quarterly bills to pay.

Once the iron has been through the beneficiation process (all that crushing and grinding) it is now ready for the science processor, the bit where iron oxide is transformed into usable iron. This module would be known as the smelter, a power-hungry system where iron oxide (Fe2O3) is sprayed with liquid CO (liquid ‘coke’ in Earth parlance), lunar temperatures making this a convenient step, and the carbothermal reduction process begins.

Transformed from Fe2O3 into Fe3O4, then FeO before arriving at Fe;

    For the science buffs: 3Fe2O3 + CO - 2Fe3O4 + CO2, 

        2Fe3O4 + CO - 3FeO + CO2

            FeO + CO - Fe + CO2
To speed up the process one would specify three modules, one for each step. A further module would collect the by-product CO2 and, using the energy available, electro catalyse the CO2 into CO and oxygen, the latter for humans and the former fed back into the smelting process.

The net result from (approximately) 10 modules would be a small factory arrangement to convert iron meteorites into iron for use in a 3D print factory. Add 3 modules for the 3D printing, and another to deliver a pressurised final assembly hall, then it will take a minimum of 13 20’ containers worth of material to be transported to the lunar surface - just to get the factory up and running, saying nothing of the needs for the human component of this lunar outpost.

On the basis of this rough, back of envelope calculation, there should be plenty of orders for space deliveries around about 2028. That is forward thinking, and it is going to need a degree of control to get it done safely and efficiently within a framework of order everyone understands – hence why humanity will require the Edict.",stories,Lunar Factory 101,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lmro1e/lunar_factory_101/,1613639453.0

Detention Night 

It was almost in the morning, the darkest part of the night just before dawn, and though the sun wasn’t up yet, I was because I decided to go for a run since I couldn't get some sleep and also to blow off some steam to calm down before my meeting with the headmaster to discuss the recent incident.

Before I go on, let me tell you a bit of myself. I’m AJ, a 16 year old  highschool freshman at Smallville University  in Pennsylvania. My dad and I came here recently after my mother’s death to stay low, and to start over again. In this town everyone seems friendly  but suspicious and dangerous. Whenever I am outside I have to keep my guard up and be on the lookout for any sight of danger. 

Now back to the present. By the time I got back home my dad already left for work without saying anything. Ever since my mother’s death, dad and I have been distant so we basically never talk or interact with each other. I took a shower, and ate breakfast and rode the bus to go to school. When I arrived there, this little rich kid, Brian O’Neal, wanted to get back at me for breaking his nose during the incident that happened last week, but the headmaster was there and called us in his office. We were in the office for what felt like an hour.  There was me, Brian, and some other students. The headmaster said that they do not tolerate such things at this school, and that we would not get away with it without punishment, so for the rest of the month we had detention at the end of the day for an hour. 

We were 7 students in total and I got to know them, and what kind of people they were during these hours. There was Amy, and Elsa Jones. The twins who think the world revolves around them, then there was Shawn Wasabi who was the class clown, always causing trouble. Steve Stark who was the son of the Headmaster was also there, but no one had known why he was there, he was always quiet and on guard as if someone was out to get  him. Dax, who was the muscle for Brian is gullible, and looks for attention, and last but not least Brian as you all know him, the kind of person who thinks what he does impresses the girls. The first week went by quickly.

On Thursday night during the second week instead of the usual teachers who watched us, we had the headmaster instead which was odd. Half an hour in, there was a power black out for a couple of minutes. Seconds before the power came back on we heard 2 gunshots and glass breaking then bodies hitting the floor. When the lights were back on we saw the lifeless body of the principal and his son.Their blood was all over everyone, we stood still and pale until the janitor came in screaming telling us to call the police. 

The police arrived on scene minutes after they received the call. We evacuated the school and the forensic team investigated the room and the EMS took the bodies to the morgue while we were questioned by Detective Sammuel. After they finished questioning us, they called our parents and told them to come pick us up. 

Everyone’s parents came and took their child home all but me. He didn’t come since he was at work outside of Smallville so I got escorted home by  Detective Sammuel. The next day, the police came back, and took me to the station where the others were but Dax, who was the janitor ,was not here which was odd since he had been there yesterday at the scene. After some time they interrogated each of us one by one and asked us question like;

“Did Mr.Stark or his son have any enemies or have you seen them having an argument with someone else that we may recognise?”

Everyone said the same thing including me: we all said that we had seen them lately, Dax and Ms.Jones who was the security guard at the school grounds, that they were arguing in the hallway or in their office but we could never comprehend what they were arguing about. 

Its been a week since the murder, and also since we last saw the janitor so we began asking questions about his whereabouts,.veryone at this point thought he was the murderer and that he got away from this town but that idea was soon abandonnedafter they found Dax in a local motel dead with multiple stab wounds.In his room they found a noose as if he was going to hang himself but that was not the case since the cause of death was stabbing so they knew that Dax was going to hang someone to make it look like it a suicide.They soon began to look for Ms. Jones who had a  connection to the victims. They searched her house, and the relatives of Ms. Jones’ houses, but she was at neither of those. The next day they found out she was at the hospital due to some serious injuries that might be related to Dax. The police tried to connect all the dots with all the information they have but couldn’t come up with the motive behind all these murders or the murderer himself. 

After some time had gone by and the case went cold, Miss Jones gave birth to a boy that we soon found out was the son of mister Stark. Everything started to make sense and we discovered that Dax and Jones were dating but while they were dating, she had an affair with the principal and got pregnant so when Dax found out  he firstly confronted him, which was what they were arguing about in school. Since that didn’t work he wanted them dead so he first cold  killed Stark and his son in cold blood.Then he invited Jones to a motel where he was going to hang her but didn’t since she killed him  unintentionally since it was self defense. In the end instead of serving time since Jones killed Dax and didn’t the police she was placed on house arrest for 5 months.

185,RaidGuy117,1613659159,"  We’d been trekking through the ravine for about half a day now and, having assumed the guards were no longer giving chase, stopped to make camp. We were exhausted and the sun was setting, the sky changing to that kind of pre-night blue. The six of us hastened to get a fire going and pitch the tents, it was dark enough in the ravine during the day, forget the night. The bulk of our supplies had been lost with the horses though, not to mention the lion’s share of the loot as well. What a waste of time. One of the others approached me, Larp, not very strong or good with a sword, but a trustworthy man, if a little slow. “Hal, there somethin’ not quite right ‘bout this place” he said in a hushed tone, ‘what do you mean?’ he glanced at the thick forest, the coming night making it almost impossible to see into “I can hear somethin’ in them trees, and don’t yer think it strange how the horses wouldn’t follow here, and how’s they go mad and ran when we tried to pull em?”. Truth be told that had been bothering me, mostly again because over half the goods were stored in their satchels, but still. “It’s just the exhaustion getting to you, soon we’ll be clear of the ravine and back on the open plains, now help get those tents set up or whatever imaginary wood beasts you’ve dreamed up will be the least of our problems”. Larp gave a half-hearted smile but I could see he was still on edge, and I couldn’t blame him, truth be told I’d heard something as well, like someone crying or laughing amongst the trees…and why hadn’t the guards followed us.

Night proper had set, and we all gathered around the fire, an imposing darkness surrounding us. Since the conversation earlier with Larp I’d been on edge, the slightest noise having me looking over my shoulder. He and I weren’t the only ones that could feel something was off about the place either, I could see it in everyone’s eyes, even Bronson, a man built like a bear with the fight to match, kept his hand on his axe, and his eyes trained on the dark beyond the firelight. We ate in relative silence, as if all listening for something unseen. I didn’t sleep well that night, I don’t imagine any of us did.

Morning came and we hurriedly packed up our gear, wishing to make haste and not be forced to camp another night in the ravine. “Hal” I turned to see Slogan, essentially the leader of the group, not an official title or anything, we all just trusted him, he usually knew the best course of action to take, so no one normally argued. He looked like he’d slept even less than I had, “Did you get out of yer tent at any point last night, go for a piss or anything?” I looked at him for a moment, then shook my head and asked him why. He looked around at the others packing up “I thought I saw the shadow of someone moving around the camp through my tent last night, but everyone says they never left theirs.” I felt a chill run down my spine, this place was creepy enough as is without hearing this kind of thing, “Couldn’t it just have been a wild animal?” I offered. He gave me a sidelong look “What animal do you know that walks upright on two legs”.

We’d been walking for about three hours, the sunlight, or at least that of it which made it to the ravine floor, had eased the groups nerves somewhat, and there were brief spikes of normal conversation. Leo, the youngest member of the group even got a few smirks out of us with a joke here and there. We decided we couldn’t be more than another few hour march away from clearing the ravine and so decided to stop and eat quickly before continuing. We made a small fire and began readying some fish to eat. Jak called me over to watch the fish while he went for a piss. Larp joined me, “Yer think we’ll get out ah this place the day? I heard more ah em strange sounds tha other night there, closer tho’, like somethin’ shufflin’ outside the tents”. I couldn’t pretend there was nothing wrong this time, this place was strange and I wanted away from it just as badly, “Slogan says we’ll be clear of it in a few hours, evening time at most, when’s the man ever been wrong, huh?”. That seemed to put him at ease, and we took the fish off the fire to eat. ‘Alright boys, you want to get out of here before dark time comes, we best make a move’ Slogan said as he stood. We doused the fire and got ourselves ready for the march ahead. Leo stood and looked around in a circle, “Where’s Jak?”.

The Sun was starting to disappear over the ravines wall, the shadows began to lengthen. “We have to go Bronson! We can’t waste any more time here, I’m sorry”. Jak hadn’t come back, and Bronson wasn’t for leaving without him, despite Slogans attempts to convince him we needed to leave, now. “No! We can spare another hour at least, Jak deserves at least that!”, Slogan almost looked like he was about to concede “He does, and if I thought we had it then we would, but we need to get moving, Bronson. If we have to spend another night here, I doubt Jak will be the only one of us to go missing”. I though Bronson was getting ready to argue again, but he just looked back at the tree line, a combination of fear and guilt on his face, then picked up his pack. We left Jak.

We’d been walking, for about 3 hours, there was still no sign of the ravine coming to an end, and the sky began its change to night. “We’ll have to start setting up camp soon” Slogan said vacantly, eyes staring down at the ground. I stopped and turned to him “You can’t be serious, we can’t spend another night here, you said so yourself”, fear was getting to me, I couldn’t stomach the thought of lying in that tent again, listening, dreading every sound. “It’ll be pitch black here in an hour, we can’t walk in that, if we don’t get a fire going and the tents up now then soon we won’t be able to”. I knew he was right, and the thought of wandering around here in the dark was just as bad as another night in the tents, worse maybe. I felt sick, I sat on a nearby rock and put my head in my hands, the noises had been louder, more frequent today. “I won’t! Yer Crazy if yer think al stay another night ‘ere!” I looked up to see Larp, wild eyed and screaming. “Come on buddy, we don’t have a choice, Slogan’s right, we can’t walk around in the dark”, he looked near to tears, “I don’ care! Am leavin’, am leavin’ now. Somethin’ out ther’ want to git us’ but it won’ get me! I won’t let it!”. He started running, we yelled after him, I went to give chase, but Slogan put his arm out “Let him go, we need to make camp”. I watched as he got further and further away, wondering if I should be running as well.

The four of us sat around the fire, no one said a word, but I don’t think any of us wanted to be alone in our tents yet. The noises had been getting worse, at one point we all stood up as what sounded like a low growling surrounded the camp, we all drew our weapons, terrified, waiting for some wild beast to run at us through the pitch black, but nothing came, and after a few moments it just stopped suddenly. We decided to sleep in shifts that night in case whatever the animal was came back. I didn’t think it was an animal at all, to me the growling had sounded very, very *human*.

Bronson and I took the first shift, the darkness even more oppressing now with just the two of us. “We should have let the guards catch us, I’d rather have faced the gallows than this place” Bronson said, and I could tell he meant it. I tried to be reassuring “just got to get through tonight and that’s it, just get through the night”, but the words were hollow and offered little respite. I was about to offer something more when we heard a noise coming from the surrounding wood, it was like hundreds of teeth chattering at once. It stopped as quickly as it had started. We didn’t speak again for the rest of the shift.

After we switched over with the others, I lay awake in my tent, expecting at any moment to hear screaming or something trying to get in. There was nothing though, it was completely silent, and yet I couldn’t get over the feeling that we were surrounded by something otherworldly, something *evil,* and it wasn’t going to let us leave here. My thoughts drifted to Jak and Larp, wandering out there in the dark somewhere, alone…or worse.

I exited the tent in the morning, having managed about 2 hours sleep, finding Bronson, eyes to the floor, sitting next to Leo, who was lying on the ground, eyes staring up at the sky. “What happened!?” I ran over to Leo, still breathing, no signs of any wounds, at least at a glance, temperature seemed fine. “Found him like that this morning, hasn’t said a word, hasn’t moved” I turned to look at Bronson “What about Slogan?”, he just shrugged his shoulders, ‘Gone’. I grabbed Bronson by the shoulders, panic taking over completely “Look, we’ve got to get out of here, bugger the gear, we grab Leo and we march until we’re out, we don’t stop.” He lifted his eyes from the ground, completely absent “What about Slogan?”. I hesitated for a moment, “It’s as you said…*he’s gone*”.

We used one of the tents as a makeshift stretcher, hoisted Leo into it and started moving, we left everything else behind, we wouldn’t be stopping again, for anything…or anyone. Leo was relatively light, but the added weight and awkwardness of having to both move at the same pace still certainly slowed us somewhat, but we couldn’t be far from the end of the ravine now, we had to be close.

It started raining, and at some point, I’m not quite sure when, a thick fog had settled over us. “How long have we been walking for?” Bronson asked, exhaustion creeping into his voice, he was strong but seemed to lack stamina. “At least 3 hours, maybe a little more”, I was beginning to lose my breath too. The approaching darkness filling my thoughts with such dread, why weren’t we out yet? It doesn’t make any sense. The noises had been getting louder the last hour as well, like a low humming sound this time, but from all sides, made my head feel like it was vibrating.

Just as I was about to ask to stop for a moment to catch our breath, something came into focus through the mist that made my heart sink. It was the camp we’d left earlier that day, the doused firepit, the torn tent used for the stretcher and the 3 others still left erect in our haste. This shouldn’t be possible, we’d been heading in a straight line all day, surely even with the arrival of the fog we couldn’t have…I watched Bronson’s fists curl as he dropped the stretcher.

“C’mon then! I’m not hiding tonight! Come get me, you cowardly filth!”, Bronson was in a fit of rage at this point, screaming and taunting whatever was out there with vicious slurs of profanity until his words sounded raw in his throat. “Bronson please!” I begged, my voice breaking “Please, we have to leave, we have to go now, we have to run”. He looked at me, the anger drained from his face, replaced with a look all together worse, despair. “To where?” and then he turned…and walked off into the fog. 

I sat for a good while, completely paralysed with fear. It was night proper now, and the humming from earlier had since changed, becoming an orchestra of laughter all around us, sounding thick with malice. I had no means nor the will to start a fire, I doubt it would help anyway. I looked down to Leo, his face too young to be in a hell like this. “I’m so sorry, Leo. God protect you…and forgive me”, I watched tears stream down the sides of his cheeks as I let go of the stretcher, and slowly backed away, and closed myself inside the tent.

I sit alone now in the tent, holding my knees, I can’t help but cry at my own despair, at the despair of everyone else. They’re out there too, the others, I can hear them, Larp, Jak, Bronson, but they don’t sound like they used to. I can see the glow of the eyes through the tent, all around me. They push their faces against the cloth, and I can just barely make out their horrible twisted features…smiling at me, an inhumane smile. It won’t be long now until they’re in here, God I wish they would stop laughing.

Leo Blinked, and it was if the fog just completely dissipated from his vision. He felt the sun gently caressing his face and with great effort he sat upright. He was at the entrance to the ravine. Hal and Slogan ran past him, Larp was trying to get the horses to follow but they were going wild and eventually bucked and ran off. In the distance he could hear the guards yelling “Stop! Thieves, you’ll hang for this”. They were gaining on us quickly. “C’mon Leo! Move it!” shouted Hal. Leo just stared after him, the events of the past few days all flooding back to him. “You can’t go in there! You’ll all-” before he could finish the sentence, he felt a hard blow to the back of his head, and as the guards slowly surrounded him, he saw the others disappearing into the shadow of the ravine. His consciousness was rapidly fading, his last thoughts a distant echo ‘*Turn back’*.",stories,The Ravine,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lmo74g/the_ravine/,1613630359.0

I completed an advanced degree in linguistics at Yale university which means that I can understand more languages than I can count and at the very minimum I know the country or origin of all languages.

Sometimes teenagers and some adults will make a play on words and kind of create there own language, but within minutes I’ll pick up on a pattern and decipher its real origin.  Also, the military seeks people like me out for encoding sophisticated spy languages that sometimes use multiple codes hidden in different languages.  I did a two year stint working as a private contractor with the CIA when Crimea was breaking away from the Ukraine and I quickly jumped ship at the first opportunity that I could get when I knew more about the conflict than Vladimir Putin, because I was constantly deciphering codes. 

I’m in a ski loft located in Eastern Pennsylvania waiting for my young daughter’s snowboard lessons to end and I brought some old Roman Latin letters to try to decipher their intended meaning.

As I was trying to decipher one of the letters, I was just taken aback by the amount of different ethnicities that were represented inside the lodge.  I could see and hear Asian, Eastern and Western Europeans, and even Native American.  I was like wow when I was listening to the  Native American tongue because besides being on reservations which were 100’s of miles away, I haven’t heard anyone speak in  a Native American tongue in public around here.

And just when I thought I heard the ultimate bliss, something else caught my ear.  Like a  Rubik’s cube my mind try’s to pick up words or accents to put together the speakers origins.  My mind was totally flustered because I couldn’t even pick up on a single noun or verb.  Absolutely nothing about their language was making sense to me.  I’m not even sure how they understood each other because the letters and words didn’t seem to mesh together but I think that’s how most people feel foreign languages sound, but I have spent more than 15 years on at least listening to every known language that exists, so I was perplexed that a language had escaped me.

There were four of them where  one couple looked like they were each about 60 years old and the other couple looked like they were each about 40.  All four of them kind of looked like aboriginal Australians but they had white skin.  They weren’t laughing or yelling they were just speaking in a monotone voice.

I even tried to write down whatever little sounds I could hear.  There were absolutely zero patterns that I could pick up on.  This was a dream come true for a linguistics expert like me because I thought I heard everything that was out there.

I must have been listening to the four of them talk for three hours straight, where I was completely immersed in trying to discover this new language when I was finally able to piece a couple of their sentences together which I determined was a rare mix of a small minority Siberian dialect and an extinct Mongolian language that loosely translated “We took your daughter.  She is on her way to Chechnya.  Tell us where Ivan Somolinivich is or you will never see her again,” then all four of them looked at me. My heart sank down to my feet in fear and desperation as I quickly looked outside through the glass at the slopes for my daughter who was wearing a pink snow outfit when I dropped her off at the snowboard lessons.  When I didn’t see her, I looked back at the four unknown people with desperation as I was jogging my memory from the Crimean days.",stories,My expertise in linguistics came back to haunt me,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lmit02/my_expertise_in_linguistics_came_back_to_haunt_me/,1613611629.0
188,StormIllustrious1293,1613636112,"Twilight is about to fall and complete darkness will soon sheath the sky . I guess today is the most coldest day of the season , merciless icy wind , slow and moist penetrating my skin giving the Shiver to my bones , like 100 small Needles Piercing my body specially in hand , having no gloves , the only way i can protect them is put them in my pocket .
 ""Oh god my ears are almost numb."" I try to cover them with my shoulders , A useless attempt indeed . ""But people tend to do anything even in most hopeless moment instinctively or with reason"", I thought to myself. "" I should have listened to the mom"".

i enter the alleyway. Two street lamps , one is dimming , making the alley look half lit and half dark. I'm half way in when my eyes meet the a sorry eye , in dark corner a quivering dog , anyone with one look can tell his state , hungry and only thing visible in his body are bones . After our eyes met he stand up in a normal way and wag his tail , while looking in my eyes like I'm the only one who saw him and only i can help him in some way if I'm not then who . A small shop is open so i thought of him buying some bread to give him , but they have very few left in stock , hardly two medium breads , "" but it's better than having nothing "". I thought to myself . The moment i offer him the bread crumbs , he finished them in the minutes. He still looking at me , i know it's was not enough to calm the appetite but I'm unable to do anything else so when I'm ready to go , i pat his head and i can feel his cold head and thin hair , ""i think , i shall come back in the morning"".

Right after, before the little distance from my home i hear the little pitch squeak , i look around and in an shade of house Estrade a little figure lay . ""It's a kitten"", i said with little surprise. You do not often saw cats here , they live in hidden and high places , so it's rare to see any kitten and if you get any chance to see them , it's most probably will be happen like in this moment . When i get close to him he was trembling very badly and he was little wet to , maybe he fell from his mother mouth and someone pick him up and left him here . I try to pick him up gently as possible , his eyes is close and he barley longer than my palm , black and white stripe in his body . another Lonely creature like one i seen little before , but he is in pain i can sense it . And suddenly i remember that in home there is some left out milk , so i thought to give him some , so i quickly entered the my house , open the fridge and pour some milk in Disposable cup . Again i gently lift him up and try to put his little mouth on the edge of the cup and i saw his barely visible tongue when he try to lick it , for few minute i hold him up just like that , after when i see him he trying to averting his mouth from the cup , so i put him back on the old thick cloth which i brought from my home and before leaving him i pick up some bricks , and set them like a wall not to high or there will be a danger that it's will fall down on him . ""It's will protect him from wind "", I thought to myself .

When i entered the house mama looking at me and it's seems he wanted to say something but stop halfway . In a comfy blanket , "" i will visit him again next morning "", i said to myself.

Next morning , was foggy , sky was grey and everything is silent . I have some milk and bread to give them , i come to that estrade and bend down little to see if he is in there , but he is not , ""but he was in here tomorrow night , where he can go?"". The bricks are also in same order and but cup is empty. "" Maybe someone took him , maybe his mother"", "" but they say if someone touch the cats ""infant"" the mother will never touch them again"". "" But who knows maybe she changed her mind you , never know "", i thought .
So i moved forward to see if that dog is too there or not , and here he is standing in same place looking at straight in to my eyes with more lively look than tomorrow , and suddenly my mind goes blank , when i saw a half eaten body of cat , and there is a no doubt that this body is belong to the same cat , exact colour. Only thing that is left in the body was just two legs , and everything was gone not even a bone . And before i fully comprehend the situation , all at once i become the prey of my blind emotions , a sudden impulse of anger and sorrow , take over my mind , and i don't know from where i pick the huge stone and throw it with all my might to that dog and it crush his head , with a pitiful cry he collapsed on ground , and with his dying eyes he look at right to my eyes , like he questioning me "" why did you do this "" , but I have no answer . Without looking back to the carcass of cat and bloody face of the dog i run toward my house.

""Why is this happened"", lying on my bed , with little wet eyes . I try to close my eyes , but whole incident start playing in my mind like a projector , for few hours i just lie in my bed and stare the ceiling with silence , 
 and then i think to go out and see what will be happening there .

I passed by that estrade , looking so silent and empty like there was an flood which takes away everything , and only remaining is left .

When i came to that place some people's are standing there , it's was already half past nine . One middle age man was cleaning the blood stain , they already move out the both carcass , and while two man standing there side to side talking in low voice , one was wearing a muffler and other had an monkey cap . ""I guess here or somewhere i dropped my things"". I said to myself . When I listen to one man who has muffler said in little High voice "" what kind of a person can do such wicked thing"". He said in a very casual way . "" Yes you are right day by day this world is becoming a unsympathetic place "", said the guy wearing the monkey cap . ""What do you say? "" He said referring the man who is cleaning the stain . ""I don't know "" he said in calm voice , "" maybe what you are saying in some extent is right , maybe today like i cleaning this dog stain , and perhaps one day I have to clean the human blood to . And still my answer will be same , but hope i still have an empathy and endurance to face that day . In a corner i was listening the conversation and from halfway of their conversation i return my home .

""So I’m a bad person?"", I said. A remorseful feeling suddenly made my heart heavy. "" Everything it did, I do what my heart said, and it’s all become meaningless just in one moment "". Don’t know where this good or bad words came from. Everything that it did, I do in instinct, good or bad whatever, I never gave any thoughts to these words. ""I still don’t, the only thing I want is relief from this feeling, but how? "" Maybe if I get forgiveness but from whom?. I asked. Mother? "" No she will forgive me easily without considering anything, I’m her son that’s enough for her.
God?, Maybe, but how, people use to say, if you do good things God will never punish you and if you do anything bad he will surely punish you, KARMA. Perhaps that’s the answer, cat killed by the dog because he did something wrong like killing a rat or his sibling, and dog killed by my hand, but what about me. A sudden unpleasant feeling takes over my mind. So I have to wait for my karma, no I can’t just live in with this uncertainty and unpleasantness. How I know if my karma will be my death or something else if it’s will be death, then it’s no matter to me and if it’s something else, or maybe forgiveness it’s not like I did any good thing but how will I know, where my forgiveness is. if that bloodstain is my testament, then my forgiveness has to be the embodiment. How can I accept anything without a definite reason, death or any other punishment will serve no meaning to me until I understand what I did is evil or a mistake, and how I can get forgiveness from it. I guess I should go there again and confess what I have done, maybe it will help.

When I get there , no one was there except one man , who was cleaning the stain that time , now he is sitting right after his home reading a newspaper and smoking cigarette . So slowly I went to them , but he is too focus in reading paper , that he didn't pay any heed , until then i stood to his side , when he look at me with askance eyes . "" I done that"", i said in low voice . ""What"" he said . "" I killed that dog "" .

"" Why you do this "" while putting his paper down .
 
I told him everything and after listen my whole story , with little smirk on his face , he said "" when i saw that cat carcass , i imagine the same possibility.

""Now what"",i said . "" Go home son , there is nothing for you"" ,He said in uninterested voice. "" How"" , i said with little annoyance , how I can go home and with this remorse? . "" just like that stain will going to fade away one day , you will forget it to , just like that "", He said . 
 ""How you know , what if i can't or even if i will and it will come back again to haunt me , like a nightmare occurring in the most peaceful of night . If you can do anything for me , give me an forgiveness or punishment , so i will be free from my sin.

With a smile he said , "" forgiveness you will find nowhere , and even if you found it , there is no guarantee it will free you from your guilt , and punishment , do you really think pain and suffering will be the real answer for anything? .

""So tell me what should i do"", i said in quivery voice , a voice which loses all hope.

""Acceptance"" , he said in calm voice . "" Acceptance my son , and what are you doing is , you trying to running from the reality.
What we done , intentionally or accidentally , the remorse will always be same , and if you ask for forgiveness or punishment , you are just using them to covering yourself from the actual truth . What you done , i confess , it not a some kind of stain which will be vanish with time , it will always be there in your memories on your soul . So at the end only thing you can do is acceptance , don't run or hide , face it with dignity and sincerity , and as time pass on you may become more tolerant with that feeling .

""ok"" , the only word i could choose at that moment. I felt a sudden gush of calmness , like someone takes away a heavy boulder from my head . I still not properly understand why.

So at the end i have to face it by all myself , But *How* it's all upto me and time .

before i go , i asked him one last question . "" Am i a good person or bad?""
""I don’t know "", for me good or bad, evil or virtue, they don’t matter. A murder is a murder, a robbery is a robbery, there may be a reason behind all of this, and I take them into a consideration, but still, it’s not going to change the fact, it may change your emotions towards it but not the truth. People use terms like good and bad to understand and explain things easily to themselves or others. They don’t want to understand subtle things. People are afraid of what they can’t understand, maybe that’s why they use terms like that. Now go home son, there are more shit things you will want to know in future, now go, I have my share of remorse to face.",stories,My First Sin ( first short story I've written hope to get some honest opinions),https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lmhnp7/my_first_sin_first_short_story_ive_written_hope/,1613607312.0

Finally, I spotted his blue hoodie in the crowd, the one with the yellow flower on it. He waved to me.

I pointed to myself, just to be sure he was talking to me, and he nodded. I ran over to him, and gave him a hug.

""John!"" I smiled happily, ""What took you so long?""

He looked at me, and unzipped his bag. He did some reaching and shuffling around in it until he got what he wanted, and hid it behind his back.

""What's that?"" I asked quizzically.

Suddenly, he showed it to me. It was a ring, with a yellow gem in it. He looked me in the eye and said with a blush, ""It would make me the happiest man in the world if you were to be my husband.""

It was like the world around me stopped, and there was only the setting sun and his sapphire eyes.

Tears clouded my vision, and I smiled so wide my cheeks hurt. ""Yes! Yes, a hundred million thousand times yes!!!"" I put on the ring and held his hands in mine. ""I love you so much, John...""

196,Salva-dore,1613605889,"I am six years old. I am in elementary school in grade 2, my first class at a new school, after preschool. I am a shy little boy /at this time of my life/ and am very civilized. I get red easily, always ask nicely, favor other kids first and stand at the back myself because since this young age I don't feel an urge to be first or to be the first to have something. 

My class is busy today. It has just been the weekend and after the weekend everyone is still full of energy. We always start the first school morning after the weekend with a story round where everyone gets to tell what they did over the weekend. (My class consists of over 20 students, so there are a lot of stories to tell). Coincidentally, we have a substitute teacher today because the teacher is sick. I have seen her before but don't know her very well. I am sitting to the right of the teacher's desk chair, right next to it. I sit on my little chair and realize that I am the last one in line who gets to share how my weekend was because we always go clockwise with storytelling. The teacher herself isn't there yet, the class is talking to each other and waiting in the meantime for the teacher to get there and sit down. I am fidgeting with my finger under the (still empty) desk chair of the teacher. The teacher arrives at that moment and plops her body down hard on the desk chair and gives the first child the turn to share the story of her weekend while my finger is still somewhere stuck under the desk chair.  I'm stuck, and stuck I am. I try with all my might to get my finger loose but I can't, I say loudly /(while another student is just telling her story)/""Teacher, Teacher!"" But the teacher immediately says in an angry tone that I must wait my turn if I want to say something! 

""*I say again, ""but teacher!""* And the teacher addresses me for a second and angrier tone than the first and tells me to wait my turn!!! Me, so shy and nullified by the teacher...still stuck with my painfully weakened child finger...hopelessly still waiting for all the stories of what my 19 fellow students' stupid weekends were like.... 19 turns I waited, the teacher even let out a fart at the halfway point of the fateful 30 minutes /(which of course I immediately figured out because I could feel the wind from the fart against my finger that was stuck/, until it was my turn, and I just asked, now that I was finally allowed to talk, ""Teacher, would you please stand up, my finger is stuck in your chair"". To which the teacher stands up and I pull my finger loose and shut my mouth for the rest of the day. 

```
The moral of the story is that I have been suffering for 30 minutes because I listened to the teacher who wanted to gag me without knowing what I wanted to say. Don't let anyone gag you, always speak out what you need to say if it can relieve your suffering. Don't keep suffering, speak up",stories,A real life happened story (with a small but helpful lesson) of me in preschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lm8bul/a_real_life_happened_story_with_a_small_but/,1613577089.0
197,WerewolfOverlord,1613605428,"In Earth 999, Demons are more common than you'd think. 1 in 66 beings is a demon. Being the second most common spirit type (behind ghosts), Demons have made quite the mess. But how do demons work exactly in my series?


Appearance? Demons vary in appearance, some resemble animals, others are human. There are no set rules that determine which demons can look animalistic and which demons must take a human host.

Powers? Demons possess many abilities unique to individuals. There are few skills every demon has. The main ones are, impervious to human weapons, telekinesis, the ability to cast what is called a ""demon flair"". Not every demon shoots fire, or ice, or even plasma. Some fly, some don't. The last ability shared by all denizens of Hell is being fireproof.

Alignment?
Demons aren't born evil in this series. Yes, most of them are souls damned to Hell, but they don't actively try to murder. Most demons in aristocratic roles would rather hide out with their legions instead of killing humans. Of course, there are some who would destroy the world, but they would be considered ""rebels"" by those loyal to the old ways. 



Weaknesses: 

Devil Traps can contain most demons. Angel knives and weapons made in Limbo can permanently kill a demon. Holy water works on demons who reside in human hosts. Demons are unable to enter churches unless granted access by an angel. Salt is an effective weapon against low-level demons, these demon's skin burns when touched by salt. Angels are able to smite low and mid-level demons. Anyone under a General of Hell is fair game for smiting.



Types of Demons: 
This is gonna be fun, but yes, there is more than one type of demon.
Fallen Angel: Some of the oldest beings in Hell.
Sinners: The most common type of demon in Hell.
Imps: Natural-born, low-class demons with limited abilities.
Hell-borns: Demons that are born in Hell, most often the offspring of Fallen Angels and Sinners.
Succubi/Incubi: The demons of Lust who lure people into sexual acts.
Crossroad Demons: Less of a species and more of a job, These demons are the ones most commonly seen making deals with mortals.
Hellhounds: Dog-like demons that act as laborers and slaves to other demons. Hellhounds can be both animal-like and human-like.
Goetic Demon: There are only 72 in this group. The members of this caste of demons are those banished by King Solomon in the Dark Ages.
Princes: Again, more of a job, but also a sub-set. These demons also are labeled the 7 deadly sins. They rule Hell.

199,WerewolfOverlord,1613595751,"Sunset is a beautiful sight, the colors contrasting with the rock-colored terrain. For the residents of a border town in Texas, sundown isn't a peaceful time. As night falls on this quiet town, parents lock the doors and send their kids to sleep. A young girl is playing by the river, normal activity for her. However, danger looms in the skies. As the girl walks back down the dirt path, a screen fills the hot, dry air. The girl runs as something large flaps its wings and follows her. As she nears the town, the creature uses its large, sharp talons and grabs her, flying off towards the mountains, screeching with glee.

Act 1: What are we hunting?:

At the border of Texas and Mexico, a red car pulls into a lot of a local diner. The door opens with a creak and outsteps Caimio, Ose, Valefar, and Vapula. Vapula takes a selfie with the car, much to the annoyance of Caimio, who came here at the request of Ashlyn. Ose says,"" Where is she? Ashlyn told us that Lilith set up the meet."" Caimio puts on his sunglasses and sighs. Valefar slurps his soda as the group waits for their contact, Gremory. Caimio notices a bar with pentagrams painted on the walls. He motions for the others to follow and begins walking towards it. Inside, dozens of monsters drink and play pool, a typical Southern bar. A woman with a pink top, black leggings, and a slit mouth sits at the counter, arm wrestling a werewolf. Caimio chuckles as Vapula takes in the scene. Gremory beats the werewolf and says,"" No hard feelings, Eh Jared?"" The wolf replies,"" A drink would help."" Gremory hands the bartender a 5 dollar bill and says,"" His choice, just nothing more than some Bud Light."" Caimio and the others walk over and sit down. Gremory chugs a beer before saying,"" Well, Caimio, Ose, Valefar, and Vapula. What brings you here?"" Caimio says,"" The Princes are getting the band back together. Rumors say that Luci got kicked out, but that's not why we're here. I assume they told you?"" Gremory sighs and replies,"" Yeah, I heard about this little army and my job. I just hope you can stop It before more people die."" Ose asks,"" What is It? Who are you talking about?"" Gremory twirled her long, brown hair and said,"" The Lechuza, that's what Ashlyn sent you here to deal with. I already sent 3 of my legion to fight it off. They were found among bird droppings, chewed up."" Vapula gulps as Caimio says,"" So it's a giant bird? What in the hell is it doing here?"" Gremory replies,"" I'm busy enough as it is helping the monsters who want peace, let alone tracking those who aren't willing or are unable to adapt."" The radio speaks out,"" Breaking News, yet another child killed by the Beast, 3 in a week. The creature's kill count is reaching 20. Police are offering rewards to anyone who kills the beast, $50,000 for the creature's corpse. The body was found by the ranch near Lachuza Peak. Officials debate whether it was an animal or a human."" Gremory says,"" Shit, the ranch was storage for my legion's weapons. If the cops find out about them, we won't be able to defend ourselves.""







Act 2: Hunting The Mexican Bird:


The group drove to the ranch, it was very large with stables and dozens of hands, all demons in Gremory's legion. Caimio drinks a beer while the others explore the house, looking at the pictures and art. Gremory hears howling and says,"" Fuck! Coyotes! Caimio, I hope you got that katana."" She grabs a bolt-action rifle and walks outside. Caimio and Ose follow her and prepare to fight off the beasts. To their surprise, no animals are dead. Instead, a demon shouts,"" Boss! It killed Gabe and Angus! Jackie found the bodies by the shacks."" Gremory asked,"" And the weapons?"" The demon replies,"" Still secure, but someone or something tried breaking in. Me and Ryan scared them off with our true forms."" Gremory groans and walks over to the bodies. Coyote's had been feasting on the fallen demons, Angus was missing all the skin on his foot. Gremory said,"" Fuck! It's getting bolder. We won't last an assault like this, signal our man in the police force, tell him to come back. I'm sure the sheriff will be eager to claim that money."" The demon replies,"" Uh, boss. Harrison went out to find the missing kids and he hasn't reported back in. I think he's lost in the woods.' Caimio asks,"" Does he know how to teleport?"" Gremory replies,"" No, none of mine can teleport. They barely can use telekinesis. I guess I gotta go save him now. Damn idiot."" Caimio notices a foul smell, one that meant bodies had been removed prior to the pair in front of him. He asked,"" Is this the spot the Lachuza dumps all its victims?"" Gremory replies,"" Yeah, the police have pretty much closed off the water bank."" Valefar walks out and says,"" I saw something in the woods, it looked like a demon flair."" Caimio asks,"" Why would your man use the demon flair? The human cops don't know about it."" Gremory replies,"" That flair means he's wounded or found something that requires more demons. We have to go find him."" 


Act 3: Slaying the Mexican Bird:


The group entered the forest, armed with rifles. A faint voice kept repeating,"" Anyone? Gremory? Silas?"" Gremory said,"" It's Harrison, he found something."" They rushed towards the cry. When they arrived, a redneck hunter had a shotgun aimed at Harrison's head. The hunter said,"" Damn cops always ruin the bars,  this one though is a demon. The hunter shot Harrison with bullets from Limbo, killing him instantly. Gremory shot the hunter in the neck, killing him. She knelt down and began crying, holding her soldier's head. The hunter got up and pulled out a knife. Gremory said,"" Of course there's an angel here! How else would he get bullets to kill demons!?"" Caimio killed the angel by stabbing his heart, dusting the skin from his bones. A bird screech echoed as screams were heard. Caimio grabbed the rifle from the angel and walked towards the noise. In a clearing, 5 police officers were trapped by a large owl, The Lachuza. It charged at Caimio, blood dripping from its beak. Caimio drew his sword and sliced off the bird's wing. It tumbled over and tried snapping at the others. Caimio grabbed the rifle from the angel, cocking it. He aimed it at the Lachuza, firing a shot into the creature's eye, killing it. The police officers thanked Caimio for saving them. Caimio said,"" I don't want your money. That money should go towards the victim's families."" The cops nodded before running off towards their cars. Caimio wiped the blood from his feathers and kissed Ose, saying,"" My little demonic fowl, what shall we do now?"" Ose replies,"" A pizza would be nice."" Caimio laughed as the group exited the forest.",stories,Latino Fowl: Earth 999 Season 3 Episode 15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lm4m2m/latino_fowl_earth_999_season_3_episode_15/,1613566951.0

201,JenineMenine,1613590799,"My sister and I go to an event at our local zoo every year that is basically a fundraiser within the zoo. So you have people in cocktail/formalwear walking around the zoo like it's a normal thing. They give out drink tickets and have plenty of great food and at the end of the night they open up the big pavilion and play live music so people can dance. It is a blast! At least it usually is. 

One year the weather did not hold out. We looked gorgeous, perfectly put together and well dressed for the event, but we got halfway through the zoo and it got cloudy. After a half hour or so, it had started raining and the people were not happy. Everyone ( a few HUNDRED people)  was crowded in the indoor aquarium and no one wanted to go outside, so generally the mood was miserable. 

Now me and my sis have a long history of going out in the rain, even at 30 yrs old we love a good downpour. This event was no different. So we pushed past every single person blocking the doors, walked straight up to the outdoor bar to fill our drinks, and continued through the zoo in the rain. We might as well have been the only ones there. No one wanted to be in the rain, so we took advantage. We got down to the pavilion and just danced and danced! There was a tram that was ferrying people from the aquarium so they wouldn't get wet, and every group that came down sulked under the pavilion. 

We just danced while it poured. We were the only ones in the whole place that were actually having fun and getting their money's worth. We had two separate people give us their drink tickets, and the end of night while everyone was miserably waiting for the tram to take them to the parking lot, we were walking through the remainder of the zoo soaking wet, carrying our shoes, and enjoying every second.",stories,The Only Ones Having Fun,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lm2r1a/the_only_ones_having_fun/,1613561999.0

Fast forward to when I was nine, and I randomly started remembering my dream from when I was 6 or 7. The image of the kid to my left, the adults, the grey sky, etc. I didn't know anyone in the dream and it felt weird to me I was remembering such a odd dream from a few years ago.

My dad went somewhere on the beach that was not in my range of vision for whatever reason and me, my dad's neighbor's son, and my little sister were all on a team against my dad's friends. There was a grey sky but I thought nothing of it. Then, my little sister went behind me and my dad's friend's son went to the left and it was the exact image from my dream.

203,Brutalsnuggles,1613587406,"An alternate history of the american wildwest with CyberPunk style enhancements, we follow an unnamed mercenary as she hunts her prey

Hard R content, in a screenplay format

Sunset over Western Kansas, 1875. (long take) The camera pans over expansive prairies and sunflowers before making its way to Dodge City, KS and to the saloon. Inside we find it busy and bustling, too loud to pick out any one conversation. We find a group of rough men are playing cards before a flash of light bursts overhead three times before staying lit, lighting the night as day. They all wander out to find aliens exiting their ships. 

Cut to credits, Black Heart by Calexico plays over story snippets explaining the worlds unification, how every city worldwide was met at the same time in the same fashion. We see an antebellum USA, over the period of five years, united with “Cyberpunk” style technology: Instant communication, enhanced solar power engines for their trains, flight, computer technology and wireless electric currents—a wild west world with technology far more advanced than our own. The alien race has not united just the country, but forced worldwide awareness and created instant globalization, though international travel is still exceedingly rare. The aliens are shown to have forced a kind of uneasy peace, implemented the technology in parts and suddenly disappeares.

We see that technology has been implemented worldwide, though the most advanced tech is still exceedingly rare, and we learn of the obvious creation of a few elite super soldiers.

Post credit
Colby, KS July 13th,1880

Cut to unknown woman, African American, very athletic build, scarred heavily but still beautiful. We see her get ready for her morning, buckling her gun belt around her waist--a revolver with a large cylinder but no actual holes/ammo in it to on one side, a badge the shape of a star with 8 points on the other, and watch leave her hotel room in a brief clip as she heads out the day.
Camera includes cuts into our main characters perspective, where we see she has a high-tech HUD implemented into her vision. It includes threat assessments, highlighting each people with an appropriate color (green-no threat, yellow- some threat, blue-equal, red-high level threat). Everyone No-Name sees green. 
Outside exterior shows a small but bustling wild-west city. A disconnect created between the marriage of future tech with the western style is embraced, creating a kind of cyber-western feel (ie GIFs of wanted posters on flat led screens). There are low level enhancements everywhere, although most regular people can’t afford them. We see that well over half of the people still have no enhancements, and walk with our hero (who will remain un-named until a past reveal later in the story) as she takes a short walk to her horse. Passersby are clearly frightened of her and give her a wide berth as she passes.

As she readies her horse (who also has a myriad of cybernetic enhancements we don’t clearly see) we hear a bing and she touches her ear like an earpiece is there.
No-name: yep (answering the phone; spits)
Caller: targets should be rustlin to your Vectro-Graph now
She pauses from checking her saddle to turn her forearm over, a holographic screen emits from a small bit of light and shows a wanted poster.
Caller: we got quite a few for ya this time, three mandatory pulses, two discretionary. Should keep ya busy for a good bit of time this go round.
The caller (male) has a friendly report with the mercenary, and the two clearly get along despite her near silence. She is the best at what she does, and he treats her as such.
Caller:  Your first target is in the southern Flint Hills, feller by the name of Tyrell Bell, real scumbag type. They caught him traveling slaves in Texas, then he escaped and took three marshals out in the process. Luck be it, he’s ours now and his pulse is up to you. Second and third are traveling together, and you gotta bring them in alive. They should be up north a ways between Emporia and Topeka. Gang was trynna pull a train robbery went wrong. Word is the rest of the gang ate it and these two, Yeshua Lejuene and Andrew Weston is what’s left of em. Round em up and bring ‘em to whichever jail they’re closer to, Governor St. John wants to see last of The Dorsey Gang Hang.
The vectro-Graph shows images of wanted posters with high def pics and info:
Tyrell Bell: Male, 43, White, long blond hair covered in a cowboy hat, black eyes, mustache and thick chops, several teeth missing, broad nose and a deep scar across his forehead. 5’5 and 200 pounds; lightly enhanced (AUG 1): LEGs Group 1 Strength and Speed, no built-ins
Yeshua Lejeune: Male 39, White, cropped brown hair, clean shaven, brown eyes, stained but good teeth, generically handsome, 6’0 and 175 pounds; No known enhancements.
Andrew Weston: Male 33 White, Shaggy brown hair, scraggly beard and blue eyes, buck teeth. 5’9 and 170 pounds; no known enhancements.
Clinton Kurtz: Male, 40, White, balding messy brown hair, large forehead with wide set eyes and a toothless cupid-brow mouth over his prominent chin. 6’5 and 240 pounds, muscular but flabby; moderately enhanced (AUG 2): LEGs Group 2, Strength, Speed and Endurance/Stability; ToRSO Group 1, Endurance/Durability; Built in Multi-shot on Right-arm, expandable shield from left.
Annette Glory: Female, 53, Black, braided hair with large, wide set eyes, good teeth and overall attractive features. 5’5 and 145 pounds, unknown enhancements.


Camera cuts between the two speakers, leaving the callers face obscured above the mouth, and the device as the conversation goes on.
No-name: and what if there’s more of ‘em left? Sounds like a trap.
Caller: if you can bring more in breathin, pay’ll be better, but those are the only two the Governor expects back alive. Shouldn’t be much of a problem either way.
No-name: I reckon not. The last two?
Caller: Right. Your fourth target is one I’m sure you already know- Clinton Kurtz. His exact location is unknown, but we have solid intel he’ll bein Omaha sometime between the 15th and 21st for an as of yet unknown amount of time. The train’ll take you if you don’t wanna ride it.
No-name shudders slightly at the mention of the train: I’ll ride it. Pulse?
Caller: Discretionary, of course proof is required, though. Saved your hardest for last. Annette Glory, pulse mandatory, Location only broadly known as the tri-state area, last known was Dodge City back in April, but reports have been popping up all over. We’re hopin you can narrow her down on your way—you can feel free to bring her in any time, just be careful, we don’t have any read on her AUG level at this point. And remember; you can’t miss that window on Kurtz. 
No-Name: Where do I bring Glory?
Caller: Oh right, Agency facilities only.
No-Name: Not a problem
With that she turns her arm over and the screen shuts off. She mounts her horse and rides out of town toward her first target.
Cut to an unnamed saloon near Eldorado where we see Tyrell Bell handily defeating a group of un-armed assailants. In order to have any group upgrade, a person must first undergo overall upgrade as indicated by their AUG level, AUG levels reflect overall strength and power, while group enhancements offer exponential, although temporary, boosts to specific groups. Bell isn’t using his enhanced legs, despite fighting six people. It is clear they’re no match for him and the damage they can inflict with their hands is inconsequential. In a move of desperation we see one of the attackers make his way from the scuffle and lunge for the gun on his belt hanging on the wall and fire at Bell; he misses all but one shot, a glancing blow on his shoulder. The bar stops as Bell smiles at the shooter. We see his finger touch a small button and a power meter light up all seven bars green. We only see the movement around the bar and then Bell standing over his now victim, his foot through his chest.

Bell: And all I wanted was a fair fight. Someone come over here’n clean this mess up.
Bell casually shakes the blood off his leg.
Bell: And draw me a bath with some company.
It’s clear by the reactions of the other patrons that they have no more appetite for this behavior, but there is nothing to be done—Bell’s enhancements, even though they’re slight, have rendered him far beyond what normal people can defeat. He walks to the bar leaving a trail of bloody footprints as we see the power bar on his legs power down. Before he gets to the bar 
Bell: What’s it gonna take to get a pitcher round here?
The bartender is filling a fresh pitcher before the end of the sentence as Bell saunters up to him, devouring the horrified gazes from the crowd that keep alternating between him and the pile of man-soup he left on the floor. 
Bartender: Agnes, go grab the girls and the hose and some mops… Here ya go Mr. Bell.
His tone is even, calm, although it’s clear he’s playing the role. This isn’t the first time he’s seen Bell act up, and he was certain it wouldn’t be the last. Bell starts chugging straight from the pitcher, pouring all over himself as he does.
The doors open gently, and we see No-Name standing in the entryway, the light shining bright from behind her. Upon sight Bell chokes and drops his pitcher, coughing and gagging as he chokes out one word
                            FUCK! 
We see No-Name lock her eyes on him and verify against her image that he’s her target. With a click we see Bell hit his legs and burst to disappear, but he’s stopped dead in his tracks before he gets to the window. We see No-Name holding him on the ground, having tackled him. It’s clear that she never activated an enhancement.
No-Name, addressing the crowd: Im here acting on orders from the Government, This man is Tyrell Bell and he is wanted for Slave-Trading, among other crimes. (now addressing Bell) Unfortunately for you, your justice was left to me. 
We’re left unsure of what’s happening as the camera cuts to their faces (shot reverse shot), but we hear pain and gurgling noises from Bell as blood pours out of his mouth. The two stare in a kind of embrace, Bells eyes in horror and No-Names almost a look of love; if not, lust. He groans in pain as he see No-Names upper body flex, still obscuring her exact motions/actions. Closeup; we see her smile as Bell closes his eyes.

The camera stands up before No-Name, and we hear a sickening crunching, ripping sound, alongside his final, most unsettling scream, as she stands up we see that she has ripped Bells head off with her hands. No power-up groups have been activated or de-activated
No-Name stands up and addresses the bartender: Add that to their clean-up list.
She isn’t malicious in how she says it, a kind of sympathetic nonchalance in her voice.
No-name: Ive got a couple of questions for you.
Bartender: of course. Least I can do for taking care-a Bell like that; that monsters been torturing me for over…
No-Name cuts him off: I didn’t do it for you. I got word about a woman came through here a while back by the name of Annette Glory. You know her?
Again, no malice, but a sincerely threatening tone drips through her words. 
Bartender: Well I reckon I know the name, but I-onno know the woman. I heard the implants she got made her psychic or somethin, made her so she kint be caught.
No-Name: You don’t worry about my job. 
A shattering iciness resonates through the room. Nobody’s moved since the mercenary stood up, everyone waiting with bated breath to see her next move, praying not to be on her list.
Bartender: (nervous) Oh ‘a’course not, ma’am, I’s just trynna helps all, but… I reckon yer right bout not needin mine. I heard she was headed east, that she was gonna go disappear in the Ozarks. Gods know I’d never go chasing Madam Glory through any kinda woods.
No-Name does her best to hide her disgust, but it clearly shines through as the bartender continues stammering on.
No-Name, cutting the bartender off: What about the Dorsey gang?
Bartender: What about ‘em?
No-Name: I heard they were holed up north of Emporia.
Bartender: (his nerves have calmed a little as he’s poured two shots of his finest bourbon and offered one to No-Name) Cheers
Their eyes meet before they down the shot together.
Bartender: Ya what’s lefta ‘em I reckon, I heard it was a bloodbath on that train, though.
No-Name: Any chance they sent that word out on their own? Set a trap for me?
Bartender: (dumbstruck) I’d nevera thoughta that, to be honest witcha. 
No-Name appraises him, a heap of bone and meat, organic, un-enhanced.
“NON THREAT” flashes under her “cyborg vision” of the appraisal
No-Name: No, I reckon you wouldn’t have. You know exactly where their hideout is?
Bartender: I kint say for certain they’ll be there now, but word is there’s a place they stay on the Neosha River, a few miles northwesta ‘Mporia. Got a hidden place tucked away in some woods.
No-Name: How many in the gang before the train?
Bartender: Ohh… at leasta dozen or so I reckon. They say just two-a ‘em made it out alive. Say they still got shot. Musta had some kinda them enhancements.
No-Name: (threateningly) Nothing like that’s been reported to me. Tell me what you know.
Bartender: (the fear back in his voice) oh I don’t know nothin’, I’s just guessin is all, to survive getting shots as many times as they say they did. Reckon you gotta have sunt-in to help holdja together make it through that.
No-Name, relaxing: I reckon you’d be right about that. You got a room and a stable?
Bartender: A Course I do, for you, I’ll put you up in the best room, free-a charge o’course!
No-Name: I thank ya for it. 
Camera cuts to No-Name in her room, she sets down Bell’s head on the dresser and takes her hat and gloves and boots off and we finally get a look at her different enhancement groups and the power-up bars associated with each; where Bell had one power bar on his right leg, No-name has four on each, each with a more streamlined feel (think led, blue power bars vs a multi color gauge) than bells. Not just on her hips, she has a set of bars for each knee, too. Her arms at the shoulders and on her wrists, and one, larger than the rest, on her chest. We see as she undresses, revealing no armor, only clothes. This world poses no threat to her.
She fishes a dollar coin out of her pocket and places it on the nightstand and goes to the bathroom where she draws a bath to clean the blood off her body. The water doesn’t have any effect on this technology. She undresses and gets into the bath, 
No-Name: Call Jackson
Her vectro-graph screen beams above her and we see the call waiting screen before the caller from who assigned the mission answers. This time we see his face in its entirety in the image.
Jackson: Good evening agent, I see you’re doing well.
No-Name: Bell is taken care of. Wasn’t a problem here, but I can’t stop feeling like there’s a trap set up ahead.
Jackson: Don’t worry about it, even if there is, just do your best to keep as many alive as possible and bring em straight in when you got em. Any word on Glory?
A knock on the door and a maid gently opens the door, wheeling a cart carrying a small banquet on top and freshly cleaned and warmed linens underneath. The cart has heated trays emitting fire, though we have no clear indication of the fuel source. Her face is obscured in the hood of her outfit and we see her scarred hands as she works, hands that have seen much harder work, hands holding the weight of years of pain; riddled with arthritis but still strong, fighting against times best efforts to weaken, unfortunately she’s on the losing side of that battle now.
Maid: Sorry to interrupt, ma’am. Would you like the food with you or in the room?
Her voice is sure and calm.
No-Name: Oh, I’ll take it here, thank ye.
Maid: (wheeling the cart silently to the bath, camera cuts and shows No-Name in her bath, facing away from the maid,) Will there be anything else? 
No-Name, slightly turns but not quite facing the maid: No, thank ye. Take the dollar off my nightstand, I left it for you. 
The maid thanks her and takes the dollar as she disappears out of the room and No-Name Searches the small buffet, coming out with a massive turkey leg. She takes a bite.
No-Name, addressing Jackson: Not much, said she was going to the Ozarks, and the bartender seemed awfully frightened of her, said she had psychic powers.
Jackson: Like we said before, we got no word on her augmentations. Unfortunately, it seems you’ll have to get that information on your own for the time being. If she’s headed to the Ozarks, though, you should speak to Guymon over in Springfield. I’ll give him word to keep’n ear out.
No-Name: I can’t say I like how little information we got on Glory. *Bite*
Jackson: I know, I’m sorry—you got your ampho-shots?
No-Name: Two
Jackson: Shouldn’t have to worry too much, then. The good news is we do have solid word on Lejeune and Weston being alone, authorities counted ten bodies, found one still breathin. Did you get their location?
No-Name studies her turkey leg and sets it down, grabs a pint of beer and downs it in one clean gulp before picking the leg back up.
No-Name: Yeah, the bartender said they had a hideout northwest of emporia. I’ll go scope it out in the morning after I drop Bell’s head off. 
Jackson: You know, you can bring the whole body in for proof.
No-Name: Too much to carry. *bites*
Jackson breaks into a laugh on his end. She’s serious, but the brutality forces a genuine chuckle from Jackson.
Jackson: Well report in when you’re finished, and don’t forget—you cant miss Kurtz. We’ll have an exact window for you next time we speak.
No-Name: Understood. 
The call screen goes blank and No-Name finishes eating her food. 
Cut to next morning (14th), Bells decaying face looking right at the camera as we hear No-Name talking to the Sheriff and the camera pans out to reveal they are at the Butler County Jail, the sheriff has distanced himself from the head No-Name placed on his desk.
Sheriff: Now we got one left alive outta the Dorsey gang, and Governor St John wants to see him hang with the last two, a macabre kinda “menage a trois” if you will. But please, be gentler than you were with poor Mr. Bell here.
No-Name: I can’t make any promises.
We can tell this agitates the sheriff, but he doesn’t want to press the issue further.
Sheriff: Well… I trust you’ll do your best. 
No-Name: Tell me what you know about Annette Glory.
Sheriff: I know she’s not to be trifled with, but clearly neither are you. They say she can talk to animals and turn herself into one. Say she can even be an eagle and fly.
No-Name: No more psychic powers then?
The sheriff has a puzzled look on his face: Psychic?
No-Name: I guess some people say she can read minds and such. Psychic, that’s what they call it, but no one, not even at AUG 4 has ever really proved they had it. They say the aliens do, though.
A chill shudders down the sheriffs back at the mention of the aliens.
Sheriff: I sure believe that. I’ve never met an AUG 4…
No-Name’s icy look cuts him off before he utters another syllable.
Sheriff: but… uh… do you know when you might be bringin them boys in?
No-Name: I’m headed their way as soon as I leave here.
Sheriff: Well just be sure to bring ‘em in alive. Lyon County Sheriff’ll be happy to have ‘em, I’m sure.
No-Name gives him a nod and walks out of the room. We linger on The sheriff, who despite having physically towered over the bounty hunter, collapses into a tiny heap in his chair and sighs in exasperation and relief as soon as the doors shut.
Cut to No-Name riding her horse in the sun, “better living thru chemistry” by QOTSA plays over a series of camera pans through beautiful vistas. We get a clear view of some of the potential her horse has with its enhancements, passing others on horseback at breakneck speed and easily overtaking a train and climbing insurmountable terrain with seemingly endless endurance. What would have been a two-day trip she can make in an hour on her horse. 
She slows as she nears a bit of forested area about a kilometer from the river, and we see from her POV as she scans the area, revealing an inordinate amount of foot traffic into an entrance obscured by brush. She starts in that direction on her horse, dismounting when she gets close to the entrance and sending her away. She walks into the woods and we hear the chorus of nature. A few steps in and we hear a rustling from behind, No-Name turns instantly to scan but is ambushed. She was expecting this, but this is only one attacker.
The attacker is small and fast, but deceptively strong; their face obscured by a mask. For the first time we see a color other than green on No-Names screen, a blue outline around her opponent, AUG 4 underneath. No-Name is unperturbed and strikes quickly, both not using any enhancement group. The attacker swings violently, though it seems less aggressive and more purposeful, as though they’re going to subdue and not to kill. No-Name doesn’t have the same ethics though and we see her cross her wrists together and swords pup up and out of her forearms. She starts to swing faster than we can see, but she’s frustrated as nothing lands and the camera cuts to slow motion—we see her attacker effortlessly dodging her attacks before reaching to her back and pulling out a small bar that expands into a 7 foot spear. The two battle to a standstill for a moment until No-Name gets the better of her attacker for a moment, nearly revealing their face. We hear the power-up sound associated with group enhancements and the attacker sends a punch into No-Names chest, staggering her long enough for the attacker to escape.
Temporarily exhausted and out of breath, she takes a moment to gather herself. Clearly, he wasn’t a lookout for these two poor souls, he took off the wrong direction, unless his friends keep bad company. After taking a moment to consider her options, whether to continue to her target or pursue her attacker, she addresses herself.
No-Name: You’ll be back.
And with that she steadies herself and moves deeper into the woods. We see her hunt through slowly and carefully, avoiding a couple of poorly setup traps on the way. As she gets nearer, we hear voices and she crouches down to scan. Her scan reveals both her targets, revealing Lejeune to have some enhancements, though not an AUG 1 yet.
Weston: Sshh, I thought I heard somethin.
Lejeune: Well maybe we oughta get caught, Iunno how much longer I kin hold on without help.
Weston: You idiot! you know they’re gonna hang us if they catch us.
The camera cuts back to the bush where the mercenary had crouched, and we see her stand up.
No-Name: Well when you’re right you’re right.
And with that we see her immediately close the gap between her and her prey and drop them with one violent strike each, the easiest fight so far. Clearly unsatisfied she pulls out her rope and hogties them both together before effortlessly slinging the pair over her shoulder. As she walks out, we see her pause, clearly looking uneasy as she scans around, the feeling she’s being watched is palpable. The camera cuts away to a beautiful twilight vista
We watch her ride to Emporia to the Sheriff station where she drops the two remainders from the Dorsey Gang.
Deputy: Ah the sheriff’ll be right thrilled when’n’he gits back
The deputy’s excitement doing its best to mask his terror of being in the bounty-hunter’s presence.
No-Name: You know who I work for?
Deputy, the terror has taken over: uhh… ye… yes ma’am. 
No-Name: Good. Send the payment there and do it by the end of the day. 
Deputy: ‘a’course, ma’am, I’ll do it right now
No-Name nods and turns to go. As she gets to her horse, we see her pause and stop. She turns around (camera shifts to her POV) and we see her scan the rooftops. We glimpse a blue silhouette of a person moving quickly to get out of view, No-Name pulls her revolver and fires a single shot that hits the chimney the stalker ducks behind, leaving a crater much larger than any pistol should be capable of, before disappearing completely.
No-Name, shouting: Why don’t you come back and fight me again in the open, coward!?
But the shouting is pointless, he’s already gone. No-Name scans the horizon again before mounting her horse. It’s almost sunset and we follow No-Name as she makes her way to an inn. 
 When she enters the camera shifts to her POV and we see her make a scan of all the patrons of the bar; one person, an older Hispanic man sitting alone at a table with a small group of people behind him fawning over him, stands out with a slight yellow tinge around his body, the scan reads AUG 2. As she walks over to the bar, the camera shifts to his POV, and we still see No-Name outlined in dark read, AUG 4 flashing menacingly on the screen.
The patron is unfrightened, or at least acts as such, and shouts over the crowd with his accent.
Raul: Hey there, friendo! Why don’t you join me at my table? Food and drinks on me!
His tone is sincere and friendly, eager for new company, he literally shoos the adoring crowd away like pests as No-Name approaches the table.
Raul: It’d be nice to have some real company for once!
No-Name, sitting down: So, what’s your name?
Raul: Raul! Raul Julia at your pleasure, I own this fine establishment. And may I ask who I have the pleasure of speaking with, Miss…?
No-Name: No, you can’t. I’ll take it you know me, though. Do you know Annette Glory?
Raul: I know the name and the rumors. Have you found her?
No-Name: Hm. I heard she was going to the Ozarks; you heard anything like that?
Raul: Well I hadn’t heard anything like that, but it makes sense with her being able to talk to trees and what-not.
No-Name: That’s a new one; I heard she was psychic.
Raul: Oh, that, too! I know one thing, if there’s a wooded area and Madam Glory is in it, you couldn’t pay me enough to go in. They say she can talk to the trees with her mind and they tell her where everyone is, help her catch her prey.
No-Name: Psychic is one thing; psychic trees just Sounds a little… far-fetched.
Raul: Here we are, sitting with enhancements that make us so much more than human, you’ve got your ampho that makes you like a god, all this tech given to us by aliens, and talking to trees is too far-fetched?!? Dios Mio! They say the light tunnel is to be done before the turn of the century, and psychic trees is out of the line?!? (chuckles)
No-Name, slightly taken aback but still amused by the attitude: I see your point. I’ll keep that in mind. Have you got a room?
Raul: For you, any room. On the house. We have an open suite but if you prefer--
No-Name: The open suite is fine. Send dinner up in an hour. 
Raul: Of course. Go to the desk and say I sent you, ask for Suite 10.
Back in her room we get new, closer looks at different parts of her enhancement groups, painting a clear picture of how barely human No-Name is. Among her things we get a quick shot of her two ampho-shots, old style syringes popping out of her gun-belt, which is mysteriously and noticeably lacking any ammo. We get another survey of her scars, her back has no enhancements and we can see deep scars all across it. Her vectro-graph rings and she answers.
Jackson: Good work with those Dorsey gang boys. The governor is thrilled, says the execution is scheduled for tomorrow. He really wants to set a clear example with these boys so he’s gonna do it himself he says.
No-Name: Be a shame to miss it.
Jackson: You ain’t gotta! Word is that Kurtz is gonna be in Omaha for two days, one night, starting on the 16th, so you feel free to head on to Topeka and enjoy yourself a happy end to a job well done.
No-Name: I got attacked on my way to them boys. Someone scanned as AUG 4, saw ‘em again after I dropped the boys off. Nearly shot ‘em but he was too quick.
Jackson gives a concerned look: We don’t have any agents in the area; there shouldn’t be any AUG 4’s in the vicinity.
No-Name: Whoever it is, they’re clearly following me. I’ll see ‘em again.
Jackson: Well be sure to stay on the lookout and try to get to Omaha morning of the 16th, latest. Report back to me when you’re done with Kurtz.
No-Name: Yup.
And with that they both click off their devices, the camera lingers on No-Name for a moment before we cut to the next day, around 1:00 PM, Topeka, at the city square we see a bustling group of people, far more a diverse crowd and more people period than belong in 1880 Topeka. We are at a kind of open-air market full of different vendors with their carts and small pop-up shops, a kind of marriage of wild west and Europe/middle east markets with the advanced technology of the world on display. We see that small screens, much like cell phones but simply a flat screen instead and foldable, have proliferated and nearly everyone has them. Many people have wearable tech, including some that have eyepieces that allow for limited visual enhancement. There is a myriad of guns, on people and for sale, mainly revolvers and rifles, but no ammunition to be seen. Through No-Names POV we see that in the crowd of maybe three thousand, only a couple of people have reached AUG 1, and not a single shade other than green for outlines.
In the center of the town square we see a massive, elevated wooden stage with a series of gallows toward the back and three blindfolded prisoners being eschewed up the stairs at gunpoint by a squad of guards. The guards line the men up in the middle of the platform, noticeably well past the nooses, before taking their places behind. Two men follow, both well dressed, one of them, a man of average height with an impressive mustache that hangs down the sides of his mouth and reaches his collar, has been enhanced, including having a large cybernetic right hand. We see No-Names scan of them, a yellow outline with AUG 3 flashes around the enhanced man.
The larger of the two men, unenhanced, takes to the stage and sticks a small black dot to his neck, when he begins speaking his voice is amplified as if he’s speaking directly through a megaphone.
Humphrey: Good Afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Lieutenant Governor Lyman Humphrey, and this is the Honorable Governor John St John. 
Humphrey motions to John St John, standing proudly with his mustache rustling in the wind, and the crowd breaks into reverent applause, fervently clapping until St John gives them the calm motion with his bionic arm.
Humphrey: We are here today to witness the execution of the three remaining members of the infamous Dorsey Gang. Their crimes are numerous, ranging from petty theft to armed robbery, rape and even murder. The world will be a better place without ‘em. And without further ado, I’ll hand it on over to Governor St John.
We see the governor nod thanks at his lieutenant and begin to speak, although he doesn’t use a device his voice still projects like Humphrey’s did.
St John: As Lt Governor Humphrey said, these men are all vicious criminals; despicable, hardly even human. And as such, I am here today to carry out their executions. 
The Governor approaches the first man and squares himself in front of him.
St John: For the crimes of armed robbery and murder, by the power vested in me by the state of Kansas, I, Governor John St John, sentence you, Gunther Vale, to die.
And with that we see as St John quickly and violently launches his right arm forward to grab Vale’s neck, lifting him straight into the air with a locked arm. We see Vale shaking as St John’s grip starts to tighten, and we see that his hand continues to close, blood oozing between his fingers, crushing Vales neck like a soda can. After a few moments of struggling we hear the final sickening crack and watch as Vales head and body fall down separately. A wave of silent horror washes over the crowd as St John repeats the process two more times.
After surveying the carnage and gingerly stepping toward the front of the stage, St John Addresses the crowd again, his voice still projecting with some added bass.
St John: Let this be a warning to all those who would break our laws. Under NewLaw, crimes will be punished swiftly and severely. Keep your head about you, and you won’t lose it as these disgusting vermin did. Now, carry-on.
And with that the Governor and his Lt turn and leave the stage, quickly but not in a rush. After they’ve exited, we see another small group of soldiers enter the stage with cleaning supplies and body bags before we watch as No-Name, who has remained expressionless and unimpressed, leaves the area.
Again, we get a good glimpse of just how impressive her horse is with its enhancements as it makes the 160-mile trip to Omaha before dusk, the camera again watching her pass all manner of vehicle. We get our first glimpse of an aerial vehicle, which easily travels faster than No-Name, leaving a clear wave of exhaust behind it. It’s small, room for maybe ten, like a kind of private jet. It quietly rides low alongside No-Name before suddenly speeding up and ascending through the clouds.  
Twilight has fallen, the camera watches (high, from behind the sign, crane shot) as No-Name rides past the Omaha city limit sign and as it turns to follow her we see it bring daylight with it, transitioning us into the next day and a busy cosmopolitan city. No-Name is on foot now and she enters the market.
She heads into a gun store tucked deep in the alleys of the market.
Guymon: Kin I help ya?
She’s tall, close to six feet, her hands are rough, and her hair is a mess of black curls, freckles highlighting her deep green eyes and rosy cheeks. Guymon has a thick Midwest accent, removing and adding letters at will.
No-Name: Be honest, I’m not sure with you, but I do have some questions.
Guymon: ‘a’ course, ‘h’whatcha reck’nin’ ‘bout?
No-Name: Where Clinton Kurtz is staying the night. I know he’ll be here tonight, and I’d like to meet him.
Guymon shifts, uncomfortable but compliant
Guymon: Yeah, I heard he got hisself a room o’er at that new-style hotel got put up o’er where Herndon House useta be. I thought the railroad bought it up, but after ’75 I guess they changed their plans.
No-Name: Right. You heard about any AUG 4’s in the area?
Guymon: O’her’n’that there’s one headed here like her mare ain’t got but one speed? Nah I can’t say’s I have.
No-Name: You ever hear of Annette Glory?
Guymon: ‘Course, can’t say I know anything ‘cept that they say she kin fly, say she kint be killed, either.
No-Name: Good thing I have to bring her in alive, then. 
Guymon chuckles: I guess so. You gotcha a place to stay I reckon?
No-Name: Would you know an AUG 4 on sight?
Guymon: ‘a’course I would. Ain’t too many-a-ya that exist.
No-Name: Right. Let me know if you hear anything.
No-Name exits the store and enters the market, wandering around the squares, interrogating different people. Nightfall and we see her watching a hotel from a rooftop across the way, crouched on the ledge.
Kurtz leaves the hotel and we see her zero in on him. He scans as AUG 3, a light yellow outline around his body. He has a squad of guards with him, all of them at least partially augmented, about half of them scan AUG 2. 
No-Name studies the gang carefully, watching and following along the rooftops as they head to the train yard on foot. As they walk everyone clears out of their way
They arrive at the train-yard and members of the guard fan out as Kurtz meets a man standing with his own group of guards. The pair stand in front of a train car and Kurtz opens the door, briefly surveys inside and shuts it.
Kurtz has a thick, poorly faked accent that doesn’t particularly belong to any one dialect.
Kurtz: And you got three more fulla N_____’s like this, eh?
Businessman: That’s right. You have the payment?
Kurtz turns on his Vectro-Graph and a hologram of a bank ledger pops up. He uses his finger to write 500,000 in the debit column.
Kurtz: To the dollar, guvnor.
With that the other group turns and leaves and Kurtz begins barking orders at his men. No-Name drops from the roof and begins walking to the group, slowly and carefully. They’re working, all of them are visible. No-Name surveys the situation a moment before deciding to act.
N.N, Shouting: Clinton Kurtz! I’m here on the authority of The Agency and have been sent here to issue your sentence. If you surrender now, I’ll bring you in alive.
The men all turn to face her as she speaks and begin fanning out in a kind of staggered column reaching out between her and Kurtz, aiming various weaponry in her direction.
Camera cuts to Kurtz’s POV and he scans her, the menacing AUG 4 still flashing below her red outline.
Kurtz: Well I only see one of you, you n_____ bitch. I’d like to see you try.
N.N: Okay.
No-Name crosses her wrists, her blades extend and she takes a step toward the column, but when her foot lands we see the blade on her left arm is soaked in blood, and the nearest of Kurtz’s goons collapses dead. The guards begin firing but it’s completely futile-- with each footstep closer we see the gore on her increase and the next guard die. 
Kurtz has panicked, his confidence has fled as he repeatedly shouts that she’s just a dumb n_____ bitch. He retreats back to a briefcase and we see him grab two syringes, one with a lightning bolt on the side the other with skull and crossbones. He injects the Ampho and joins the battle, rushing in so fast we lose sight of him, though we do see the poison show up next to one of the AUG 2 guards.
N.N reacts, ducking as Kurtz lunges at her and the camera cuts to slow motion. We watch as N.N Finally activates all of her enhancement groups, sending her into a blinding fury to match Kurtz. The two fight for a moment before we see the AUG 2 guard sneak up from behind and jam the syringe into No-Names back, instantly incapacitating her.
Kurtz: See, toldja you’s just a dumb n____ bitch. (addressing the remaining few guards, about 1/3 survived) Load it up on Eichmann’s car to see if he can get some’a them enhancements out before we dump it off. I’ll check on her when we get moving.
And with that the camera slowly pans away from overhead as we see Kurtz board the train and his goons load No-Name onto one of the cars.

Cut to No-Name’s POV. She’s naked in a room that takes up nearly a half the train car, tied to a surgical table, and we see her check and pull against her bonds before it registers that she doesn’t have her HUD anymore. She starts to breathe in a panicked way, the first time we’ve seen her seem the slightest bit nervous before we hear the door to the car open.
Eichmann: Oh! I see you’re awake! Good!
Eichmann’s voice is erudite and charming, nearly unpleasant in its pleasantness, he walks around the room as he speaks, opens a counter, appraises No-Name as he monologues.
Eichmann: Struggling will be quite useless, and I’m not surprised you weren’t prepared! I’ve only just developed it, the serum that renders enhancements unusable for a time. Should be a couple days. Unfortunately, especially for you, the only way to truly remove an enhancement is… well. Removal. And that’s where I come in!
N.N. steadies her breath, nervous but refusing to panic.

Eichmann: And, with how deeply these are all embedded, I’m afraid it’s an extraordinarily invasive procedure! Honestly, we’re not even sure if you’ll survive, but I guess that’s a risk they’re willing to take! Ha!

Eichmann gives a genuine and unnervingly charming smile as he goes to his workbench to get his tools.

Eichmann: This is going to hurt.

205,NoMoeHoes,1613551763,"

Everyone wants to chase and live their dreams, right? Well that’s what a guy named Evan Law tried to do! 

During a warm summer night in Kingland, Colorado. Evan was inside his bedroom ready to go outside after his vape was done charging. He proceeded to grab his vape and put on his sketchers and finally went outside, he realized he needed a change in his life, to save him. Evan was tired of redoing the same thing every week. 

Evan wanted to change his dire life and quit his job at the local post office and move out of his depressing town in Colorado. He thought staying in his hometown would not be that good for him; he wanted a brighter lifestyle more than everyone else that lives there. But Evan not have the money to leave Kingland, or even to make himself happy. 

The next day, Evan woke up around noon and decided to get in his car and drive to his old high school he graduated from in 2010. 

It was a Saturday afternoon, June 19, 2016. When Evan finally arrived at the school, he got out of his car, stretched, and took a big hit out of his mango-flavored vape. As he walked to the main entrance of the school, he stopped and stood right in front of the doors, the doors reminded him of his years of school here. He missed the school, but to an extent, because he got bullied during his freshman-sophomore year for being emo and liking country music.

But he laughed it off and tried to forget about the emo phase, as he is currently trying to get out of it, but not as bad as before. 

As Evan took another hit out of his vape, he walked towards the doors and tried opening it. Of course it would be locked, Evan is facepalming. But while he was walking towards the other doors, he noticed a pink customized G-Wagon parked near the lunch doors. As soon has Evan was near the doors, he could smell a strong scent of Axe Body Spray and Victoria’s Secret Perfume. Then Evan tried opening the door, and it was surprisingly unlocked. He pulled the door open and walked onto a freshly mopped floor and noticed a pink diamond crusted Caution Sign. Then as soon as Evan saw the sign he heard a door open near the water fountains down the hall. The first thing he saw was a pink mop bucket and a man in pink customized janitor jumpsuit coming through the door. 

Evan saw the diamond crusted nametag on the jumpsuit and it read ‘Chris’. He has known Chris since freshman year. Chris didn’t notice Evan at first because he was wearing pink Apple Airpods on full blast. So Evan tried to get their attention by waving and saying their name repeatedly, but that didn’t work. So Evan took the biggest hit on his vape, more than his lungs can handle and blew it straight to Chris’s face like the douchebag Evan is. 

After Evan blew the biggest cloud he ever made, Chris screamed and tried to get out of the cloud Evan blew at him. Soon after the cloud dissipated, Chris saw Evan and ran towards him and giving him the biggest bear hug he ever received, so tight squeezing the living hell out of him turning him into a Christian like he was once before living with his grandmother back in 2004.

“Chris!” Evan had screamed in joy and panic.
“Evan!, my darling, it’s been so long.” said Chris in a soft voice.
They talked for about 30 minutes catching up on there personal lives. 
“Hey, you think i could take a leak?” said Evan
“Go for it, just don’t fall in.” Chris said as he slapped his knee. 

Evan took a nostalgic walk to the bathroom looking at the anti-bullying posters and notice his face on one of the posters, calling him a loser as of all of the administration approved of the banner. 

Angrily, Evan grabbed the side of the banner and threw it down, and he stomped, spit, vape, cursed, and threw it away as he brushed his hands as he walked into the bathroom. 

He opened the bathroom door and walked in with high hopes until his pride was shattered when he saw his recent phone number written on the urinal divider saying, “Call for homemade bread and easy head!” Evan looked at his phone and remembered all the times random people would call and ask if he made bread.

Eventually, Evan exited the bathroom with a cloud of vapor surrounding him as he walks out the door, trying to boost his ego. Then he walked down the hall and continues where him and Chris have left off. 

“Well, I hope you find your zen, honey.” said Chris.
“I’m trying my best to innovate my plans to to leave here, i want a better life, something better than this dull, colorless place.” said Evan. 
“What you need, is guidance, based on all the tea you spilled, it seems like your lost, trying to find hope for the future.”
“Yeah, I guess you can put it that way.” 
“Listen darling, I’m only a janitor, doesn’t mean i’m not happy right? It all depends of what you make life about, nobody can change it except for you.” 
“I’ve never really thought of it like that before, everything really is what you make it huh?”
“It’s the effort you put in and the patience that make it worth it.”

About another 30 minutes go by, and Evan decides it’s finally time to leave, and while he and Chris give their farewells and advice, Evan decides he wants to leave tomorrow. 

The day comes to an end, Evan is laying in his bed again, pondering about what his next steps are about his future and what his journey might look like throughout his life. 

May Evan Laws moves be unknown and complex, but never unexpected.",stories,The Emotional Days,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/llq0v2/the_emotional_days/,1613522963.0

Sofia decided to brush it off tho, she told herself that she was probably just overthinking and being paranoid. So her walk is going well as usual when she sees a path leading off the walking path she’s already on, she’s never noticed this path before so she’s curious and decides to go down the path, it’s very long and the further she walks on the path the darker it gets even tho it was only about 7 am, still walking she decides to go on her phone and use maps to see where she is, it was weird tho the map wouldn’t work on her phone.. the time stopped showing, the date no longer was displayed on the screen as usual, something was off and while still walking, looking at her phone she fell out of nowhere and hit her head causing her to pass out, she woke up after awhile but when she went to check the time she remembered her phone wasn’t showing the time anymore so she had no idea how long she was passed out for, she looked at her surroundings and was extremely confused, she was no longer on the mysterious path but she also wasn’t on her normal walking trail, she didn’t know where she was, it was a forest but it was different.. almost like she had entered another dimension or another world, she wandered around trying to find a way out but she couldn’t find a way out... I am her, I am Sofia, I’ve been trapped in this place or whatever it is for what feels like days but I wouldn’t know because almost nothings working on my phone, I’m so hungry and scared, I can’t find a way out no matter how long or far I walk there’s just no way out, I only have 7% battery left at this point so I’m writing all of this down in my note pad on my phone since it’s really the only thing that works and I hope by some miracle someone finds my phone and sees this, so to whoever finds this beware of the mysterious path cause once you walk down it.. there’s no going back.",stories,The mysterious path,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/llo3dh/the_mysterious_path/,1613515120.0
207,idenisa17,1613510427,"He tied her up quite easily, James was experienced with this kind of thing. His favorite thing in sexuality was the domination part, and even he was surprised that he didn’t feel that urge to try something like that with Valentine before. They liked rough-fucking, slaps, and spanking, but they didn’t use toys or something like that until know.

Valentine was looking incredible in the soft light, tied up, with her intimate parts exposed.

He felt the need to capture the moment and took a picture of her.

She didn’t mind. On the contrary, he had the impression that Valentine liked that. 

She was hot and wet, her face exuding pure desire.

In the beginning, James wanted to blindfold her but seeing her like that, he suddenly gave up the thought.

He caught a grip of her ponytail and entered her tight pussy. He bounced into her, holding her hips and clenching his teeth. Her moans and the way she turned her head to look straight into his eyes was pretty intense. He pushed harder into her, and she begged him to kiss her. He kissed her ferociously and bit her lower lip. 

He slapped her ass several times, knowing that this was one of her weaknesses, the thing that was pushing her so very close to the peak.

Her moans were slipping away from her full lips. 

And in that moment, she had something in her that was making her look like a porn actress.

James enjoyed the view and the tight cunt he was roughly fucking.

Valentine was looking like a completely different person. 

Her curves were disturbingly enticing and the image of her body tied up was making James lose control.

His thrusts were deep and rough.

She came fast and moaned with delight.

208,mtp6921,1613479318,"
In 2019, I was an employee at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.  I worked at various places around the park to include at the main entrance guest admissions.

I’m a bit shy from a small town in Rehoboth Massachusetts.  Before moving to Orlando, I was never really exposed to anyone besides farmers.  

While working at the admission kiosk one afternoon, I was stationed right next to the exit isle where guests are funneled to leave the park.  It was mid august at about 2:00 pm and the mad rush of the days traffic had died down dramatically. 

As I stood at my booth a woman in her early 70’s was waiting for the rest of her family to meet her at the exit.  The woman who had light dark skin leaned over to me and said “it’s no good in there!” In a thick South American accent.

We’re taught as cast members to be cheery and optimistic regardless if it’s 100 degrees and there’s a two hour wait for each ride, so I responded in a perky voice “I’m sorry ma’am
today was a bit busy and hotter than usual but did you know there other things you could do ...”

Then she cut me off and said “No it’s not that.  Darkness lives in there!”

I kind of rolled my eyes a little when she said that and I thought to myself this is only the most magical place on earth.  I foolishly responded “what makes you think that?“

The woman responded “My Roma culture that has been passed down to me for 100’s of years in Argentina has instilled in me a sense when evilness is trapped in certain environments.”

I thought to myself ok this lady has really gone off her rocker.  I jokingly said in a perky voice “humans, service animals, Disney characters, and ghosts can all leave through this exit way right here where your standing.”

The elderly woman picked up on my sarcasm but wasn’t all that thrilled.  She told me “you will have thousands of people who will come through these gates but no one has the knowledge that I will tell you. You see evilness doesn’t feed off goodness.  It needs other evilness to travel.  I can tell you that there’s evilness trapped in there but why it can’t transfer itself out is something I can’t explain. The next time during a lightning storm pay very close attention at the exit area towards the ground or right after a big rain storm where the clouds turn black then the sun is really intense,  look inside the shadows of puddles!”

I was kind of just taken back by everything this older woman had to say.  It was really the absolute last thing I would have ever thought about was evil souls within the Magic Kingdom.

Fast forward about a week later to another one of my job roles where I stand in front of an assigned ride entrance and smile and tell the guests that there was no eating or drinking allowed once they entered the “Mine Train.”  It rained everyday in August but this one storm was cataclysmic where the clouds turned completely black and it didn’t stop for two hours straight.  The park had basically emptied out but it was my job to stand in front of the entrance to the ride regardless.

Knowing how Orlando’s weather typically changes and it eventually did and because the park had emptied out, I was just so atypically bored starring down at the puddles of water that had caused little streams.  Because the clouds were so black it appeared as though the brightest sun came out.
I was dozing off in my own world when I said “I’m sorry sir the Mine Train is temporary closed down still because of the weather.”

My coworker standing next to me laughed at me and said “Grace who are you talking to?”  Though I was voted the underachiever of the year my senior year in high school, I had tested into the gifted program and my brain was pretty good at aligning past subtle tings to present situations, so hearing my coworker laugh at me made something in my mind instantaneously put together what that older woman from the previous week told me to what I glanced at in the puddle.

I could see the shadow of the man in the puddle drift away towards the “Tomorrowland Speedway” ride then I ran as I saw the figment of the shadow go through gate of the Speedway, then I lost track of him as he headed towards the back of the ride.

I was left completely speechless.  I know what I saw and what I saw was a man in his 30’s wearing a vintage rugby shirt with jeans and he was holding something smallish and narrow looking in his right hand.

I know my coworker was going to think I was crazy for talking to somebody who didn’t exist then running after that imaginary person.  So I dropped a five dollar bill in the water and picked it up and told her that I ran after money I saw floating by.  I gave her the five dollar bill and I told her I’ll keep the other one which made her forget about me addressing the shadow.

I was at a complete loss for words.  My millennial self was certain to be an atheist, but everything changed in 10 seconds.  That Roma woman had put the thought in my head which I probably had seen dozens of times, but never focused on.  I had these awful goosebumps go through me because I had no idea what these souls were possible of doing.  I asked myself what is the definition of good versus bad?  Am I good or am I bad?  I wish I knew someone I could raise these questions to.  I’m an only child and I raised myself to be a bit to independent at times.

My shift ends at 11:00 pm and this is the most terrifying day of my life.  I don’t know if one of the trapped souls in the park will jump a ride within me.  My gritty self couldn’t muster more than an awkward hi to guests coming on to the ride when the Mine Train eventually reopened.  I really didn’t care if they ate or drank.  I always heard stories of people appearing perfectly normal then seemingly lose all touch with reality and now I’m definitely wondering if some traveling soul got within their bodies and caused them to do evil things.

The Mine Train closed at 11:00 pm that night and I didn’t know what to do to prevent my body from being invaded.  My parents made me receive catholic communion then they put me in weekly catholic catholic classes so I kept on repeating the “Hail Mary” over and over again until I got to my car.  When I got to my apartment I did as much research as possible on parasitic evil souls needing a host to travel.  I did find online references in the gypsy / Roma culture and it seemed to summarize that there needed  to be some type of evil deed performed for the parasitic evil soul to engulf itself within the new host.

I stayed up all night and racked my brains thinking why now are these evil souls trapped in the park.  Disney is Disney and very little has changed over the years. There has always been an ample amount of security and with social media the smallest thing get posted everywhere.  My mind was over consumed trying to come up with a reason and I kept on getting no where.  

My once beloved hot weathered job had turned into a  literal haunted graveyard to me.  I had requested to work only at the front gate because I knew the evil parasitic souls couldn’t get past the gate.  All those tales I thought were fictional like vampires who couldn’t enter a home without being invited were also true for evil parasitic souls who needed one soul to enter a residence then a different evil host to exit a residence and apparently the front entrance and exit gates to the Magic Kingdom constituted a residence.  

There was a terrible lightning and thunder storm in September after the park had closed so just for the heck of it, I stayed around a little later and watched the ground by the exit gates to see if I could see any of the wandering evil parasitic souls.  Sure enough they were like mosquitoes attracted to light in how they all congregated by the front gate.  I stayed the furthest away I could from them while I was still able to make out a lot of features about them.  All of the souls looked weathered.  Meaning none of them could be models.  There was a certain feature about them like they didn’t take care of their skin or something.  Obviously they were all desperate to leave.  All the souls were just looking for any type of Abhorrent behavior so they could jump ship.

I was seriously contemplating quitting my job.  I felt like a Victorian person being told there’s germs everywhere that we can’t see which is good to know to avoid them but who wants to know there’s a world filled with fecal invested Ecoli on everything we touch.

I wanted to stick around at the job at least until October because my parents were coming for a visit.  I could get them free tickets and in front of the lines for most of the rides.  I haven’t gone inside the gates in days and I might just let my parents go by themselves.  We had a staff meeting inside the park and I told my supervisor that I wasn’t feeling well and he just let me go home.  

I made it to October and my parents arrived to Orlando.  I didn’t want them to worry about me so I went inside the park with them.  Once I entered the park, every footstep I heard was absolutely terrifying.  I hadn’t made it past the main entrance Main Street area in weeks and I felt like I was in a war zone.  I knew I wasn’t a saint.  There were countless boys that I had dated for no other reason to make another girl jealous or just because I was bored then just to dump them.  Also, I didn’t want the parasitic evil souls to thrust themselves inside my parents because I didn’t know what darkness my parents were hiding.  

My parents saw that I was visibly shaking so I had to do something to make it stop.  I knew there was a nearby first aid station so I went in and told the nurse I was having allergy problems which she gave me Benadryl, which I knew had a natural anti anxiety affect.  A few minutes later I felt a little bit better but I was still terrified.  I knew these souls were just looking for a host and me and that Argentinian woman were the only people who knew they were lurking around the park.

We got to the Mine Train ride which my parents enjoyed but they could tell that I was not having a good time.  I was really trying to do everything to keep myself together but the Benadryl was losing its affect.

My parents wanted to go on the “Tomorrowland Speedway” and I was in no position to actually drive the car but I could just sit next to my dad.  I really felt so bad because I was really breaking his heart by shaking and having nervous convulsions.  As he drove around the track he knew I was just to out of it to converse with him, but he talked to me anyways.

Then my father said something that I had totally overlooked.  As he rounded the corner towards the back of the speedway ride he pointed and said “I remember my father taking me back there like every half hour to the designated smoke area when I was a little kid so he could have a smoke.”

That’s when it dawned on me that the park had recently discontinued smoking within the park.",stories,Trapped souls inside Disney’s Magic Kingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ll30h8/trapped_souls_inside_disneys_magic_kingdom/,1613450518.0
209,T-LJ2,1613472444,"So I'm going to be uploading each chapter of this short story I'm writing called: \*The Madadasta Cat\*

Madadasta is the purposefully mispelt word of Madagascar, Madadasta Cats are what I called Lemurs when I was around 3 and still do to this day. XD

Madadasta Cats are Lemurs, but in this story their actual names are Madadasta Cats, the humans call them lemurs when in actuality they're called madadasta cats.

Now I present to you:

THE MADADASTA CAT: CHAPTER ONE - JEFFEREY

This is a story set in **July** **of 2006.**

There was once a cat, he was from Madadasta, the cat was quite long and his species either had grey, brown, red-brown or black fur, but this particular one was different from most of the others, he was a **MULTICOLOURED** **MADADASTA** **CAT** named Jefferey, Jeff for short.

He was the last in a rare line of Madadasta Cats that were considered higher beings than most of the regular looking Madadasta Cats but because they had thought to be extinct for millions of years, everyone thought he was weird, which made him feel a bit isolated from the rest of the Madadasta Cats.

However, he just ignored them because he didn’t care how anyone looked, he cared about what people do rather than who they want to be and that he was happy the way he looked, he didn’t care if people thought he was weird because he was being who he was, not being something he **WASN’T**.

Soon the spring turned into the hot summer and Jefferey decided to go on holiday just as a small retreat from his home of Madadasta, in his small sailing boat, out deep in the deep blue, he met a few friends a couple of sharks that surprisingly allowed him to pass through, some ducks which he was very surprised to see all the way out here and some geeses which were also surprising to see.

The journey got a bit rocky because of the slightly windy weather, but it wasn’t all bad most days it was lovely and calm and plus the gentle feeling of the rocking of the boat helped him sleep. Jefferey headed to somewhere quite far away from his home, to a place known as Britain, more formally known as the **UK**, he thought this would be a nice place to stay, a difference from his very warm weather back in Madadasta.

Using his powers of invisibility, He docked his boat at the nearest dock at **PORTSMOUTH** and hitched a bus ride that took him all the way to all the way to **COLCHESTER** because he’d heard a rumour that there was a hotel there that he could stay in.

And so his adventures had finally begun!

I used to have a colleague at my previous job. His name is Alex. During the break we always went to the store together to get food. Alex was in love with a girl who was behind the counter.  

Before we entered the store we first went to the snack bar so that alex could exchange his bills for pennies. How smaller the money the better. So he could show the cashier his love at the food store by being annoying.  She remained friendly and eventually alex decided to send her a friend request on facebook. She declined. Then he deleted his facebook. It was a sad time for him.",stories,The pennie man,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ll09l0/the_pennie_man/,1613438560.0

Days passed, weeks, too, then a month had come and gone. And Bird grew in strength. She could walk, now, though it was lanky and awkward when she did, as it had always been. And the relationship between the women grew. There was never a question about what had happened to Bird that night that Eleonore and Beau found her. It never came up. And Bird never wanted it to, so she helped Eleonore with whatever chores were to be done. 

At night, Eleonore took off the boots the other woman had borrowed and wore around the property and cooked and cleaned for her, recognizing within herself—even though she felt no such attraction to Bird—that there were hints of the relationship she’d imagined—that dream of being a wife serving her husband—for herself with Beau and which never came. Bird, with her longer limbs and thin but square shoulders and that deeper voice, mimicked a man, and though Bird had healed much over the weeks, she still needed help. Eleonore nursed the woman. She served her. 

At the end of their second month together, Bird told Eleonore that she’d had a dream in which it was revealed to her that the charm she wore around her neck should be given to Eleonore and that the talisman—though she wouldn’t call it that to Eleonore—had been given to her some years prior by another woman who had worn it and, also, had a dream to give it to Bird. There was a sweet moment of ceremony as Bird stood behind Eleonore seated on the couch with her Book of Mormon and untied it from her neck and placed it on Eleonore’s. That amulet could be found between Eleonore’s fingers when she was alone in the barn—or backside of the house or in the kitchen cooking for her companion—thinking of the life that she’d come to know in the last weeks and wondering if she could live without the other woman. 

And one morning, Eleonore asked about Bird’s tattoos.

“Is that why you got them?”

“What do you mean?”

“You got them, because you go by Bird.”

“Ohhh… yes.”

“They’re pretty.”

“Aw. Thank you.”

“I’ve not ever gotten one, myself.”

“Yeah. I’m not surprised,” Bird laughed.

“We don’t get them.”

“What do you mean? Mormons?”

“Yes. Mormons. But we’re not supposed to drink tea either,” Eleonore made a face, squeezing her eyes shut.      

“My first love…” the black-haired woman trailed off, looking from the sides of her eyes at Eleonore leaning forward in her seat to hear the rest. Bird didn’t want to go on saying what she was saying and shook her head.

But Eleonore insisted,

“Yes? Your first love! Please, tell me. I have to know.”

Bird groaned dramatically and said, 

“She was a Christian.”

“Oh, Mormon?”

“No. She was Pentecostal.”

“I don’t know much about it, but I know we’re different.”

“Yes.”

“And?”

“And what?”

“Your first love. You were going to tell me about your first love.”

Bird looked jokingly around the room and back at Eleonore and said,

“Are you ready?”

“Yeah.”

“Okay, then. I’m going to tell you, but we have to start at the beginning, how I got into the situation that led me to her in the first place.”

“Her?”

“Do you want me to tell the story or not, Eleonore? Huh?”

“Sure. I just… I just… go on. Forgive me,” and she spoke quietly to the round, pink face of the shorter, fatter woman. Bird told her of her early life as the only child of an impoverished couple that lived on a cursed bog of a property on the rural coast of Maine. Her father drowned in drink, the grandson of Irish immigrants. Her mother—a dark eyed Islander who only spoke some English—had been a circus performer and had fallen from the top of a crowded tent and was left permanently disfigured by the fall. And it was by some unlikely happenstance that she’d met and married Bird’s father and conceived the girl, but as the thin, black-haired girl grew, her mother’s reputation of being a harlot and unfaithful to her husband in the small rural town preceded the girl. 

By the time Bird turned eight years old, her mother had moved into an ancient looking house and gotten the same strange, androgenous haircut as the other bug-eyed men and women with whom she shared the house. They called themselves, “Howardites.” Their leader was a lanky and long faced theologian known as the Doctor Howard, and by the time Bird was ten, her mother moved west with that bizarre collection of human beings and was never heard from or seen, again.

“I have hated religion, ever since, Eleonore.”

“It’s okay. Don’t…” and before she could say anything else, Bird continued, saying,

“My old man lay in drink around the house. He was, himself, dying, and I hit puberty starving by myself in that squalor, Eleonore. So, I left…” and she went on telling of the nights in the freezing streets of Boston and New York City and Pittsburgh where she was adopted by a transient family of big-nosed and yellow skinned gypsies. Certain aspects of that time, though, Bird left out. For it was with them that she learned to survive by means of fraud and less than violent crime. Her hands and fingers were small. She was a prodigy at forgery and recreating the lettering and lines of government documents with her free hand.

“I was with them for some years, by the time they wanted me to marry one of their nephews or cousins or someone.” Now, Bird stood holding the mantlepiece and leaning toward the fire and staring down into it.

“They wanted you to marry someone? Like an arranged marriage?”

Bird nodded silently. The orange glow of the fire one her face as Eleonore gazed carefully at the lanky woman.

“Sometimes, we have those. My mom wanted my sister to marry someone, but she left home.”

“What happened to her?”

“She died in a car accident in California.”

“Oh, no. I’m sorry.”

“It’s okay. I didn’t really know her. I just know the story.”

“Hmmm…”

“Anyway, go on.”

“Are you sure you want to hear this?”

Eleonore twiddled with the necklace Bird had given her and dragged her fingertip over the edge of the arrowhead. She sat and stared at the woman—who was standing and telling the story—and rubbed the smooth ball of amber and nodded,

“Yes. I’m sure.”

“Okay, then… Where was I?”

“The arranged marriage.”

“Oh, yeah. His name was Rami.”

“Rami?”

“Yeah. He was the ugliest thing I’d ever seen in my life, and the family talked about it. They loved me, you know? I love them, too. They’d been so good to me. And, anyway, they put me in a dress that was way too tight and this crazy headdress looking thing or whatever it was. I don’t know. And we had a ceremony. There was dancing and yipping around a big old bonfire on the beach in North Carolina, and I got drunk.”

“Drunk?”

“Yeah. Drunk. I might tell you about being drunk, one day, too.”

“Okay.” 

“And that night… that night… our first night together married, I knew…”

“Knew what?” Eleonore leaned forward and to the side in her seat. She rubbed one knee slowly and listened and forgot to breathe, recalling her own marriage and that first night.      

“That it wasn’t that way for me, Eleonore.”

“What do you mean?”

“What do you think I mean?”

Eleonore opened her mouth, but no sound came out, and Bird continued, telling how she waited till the hours before the sun came up and her new husband was snoring loudly in their RV—what was supposed to be the beginning of their life together in their new home and said,

“Then, I left. I fled in the dawn and made it to Asheville, North Carolina, and I was so young. Still a child, and I had a few hundred dollars that I’d taken, and I drank it all away and cut my hair off so boys wouldn’t like me and hitchhiked with strangers up into the Appalachia and was over in Tennessee when a local pastor found me outside of a gas station, and I was drunk.”

The pastor and his wife—who were both old in age and also without child—adopted her as a sort of project, and he preached, most nights of the week, in a north facing building that was little more than the temporary husk of a whitewashed chapel, like some roving revival tent where men stomped their clogs so that the earth itself shook and clapped their hands and waved sweaty handkerchiefs in ecstatic rapture. Some fell on the floor and writhed and shouted as if in pain. And on certain nights of the week, the men would carry out a wooden box like a coffin into the midst of the congregation and open it. There were, inside, a number of snakes thumping around in it. And some of them, as they felt led, would take up the poisonous things and be bit or extract the venom from their pink fangs and collect it in a small mason jar and hold it up for all to see and drink it. 

“Two men died of it.”

“Really?”

“They did, and I was there, you know, just hanging out. The pastor was a nice guy, and he had me working in a rich lady’s horse barn in the next little town over, about five miles away.”

“And you went to church like that?”

“Well, yeah. But you know, it sounds crazier than it was.”

“If they were drinking snake venom, then it’s crazy, Bird.”

“True. Very true. And it was crazy. Like I told you, before, I hated religion, so I figured it was okay, because religion was crazy to me, in the first place. And anyway, I’d go up and put my head on the altar at the end of Sunday morning services and show them that I was at least trying to become a Christian, even if I hated it. And I carried a bible.”

“Why?”

“Hmmm… I was going to school. They let me stay for free. They fed me, even though I was saying I was a vegetarian, which they thought was odd, and they let me eat cereal and oatmeal every morning. I had nowhere else to go, though, Eleonore. I was young and scared, kind of.”

Eleonore nodded,

“Did you learn any of it?”

“Not really. Nothing I can remember, now.”

“And?”

“And I think they kind of held me at a distance, like I was a cursed black cat or something. They were always trying to get me to wear girl clothes, and I wouldn’t have it. I mean, sometimes, I would, just to shut ’em up. And so, people knew. At least, I think they whispered behind my back that I liked girls, and they were right about that. Still, though, I didn’t like that. And I used to sit behind this woman and her family. Her husband was with her pretty often. She’d had a few kids, and you could see that their marriage was…was… um, well, it was…”  

“What?”

“She wasn’t happy. It was obvious that she’d been very pretty when she was younger, even though she was young then, but she’d been married and had gotten fatter and didn’t have time for herself, I guess. And at first, you could see how she’d try to be sweet to her man when he was with her. And you could see how he ignored her. I can’t say what it was, exactly, but he was angry looking or something.”

Eleonore tried to slow her breathing and pushed her fingertips into her mouth and felt embarrassed. 

Bird went on,

“So, as the time went on, I just sat there, and I’d see her every Sunday, and she’d look back at me, and I knew. I knew through her eyes that there was so much pain in her marriage and about herself, the aching of something amiss in their marriage was communicated to me. You know what I mean?”

There were heavy thumps of heartbeat in Eleonore’s throat, now. She was paralyzed by the shame she felt in hearing this story that was her own, and how—or so she guessed—these same events led to a lesbian love affair between the married woman and Bird. It scared her. And she bumbled and muttered the words,    

“Um… I don’t know, quite, if I do.”

“Her husband didn’t love her.”

“And… and how did you know that?”

Bird looked into Eleonore’s light eyes and said,

“I just did, Eleonore. I’m a woman like she was, even if I don’t like dressing one. Her eyes betrayed her loneliness, and something about the way she saw me looking at her, seeing her in it… well, the pastor and his wife took me to their little meetings every night, and every night, the woman was there, too, and every time she got a chance, that woman was stealing a look, looking back at me looking at her.”

“What about her husband?”

“He didn’t come much, anymore. And one morning, before school, the pastor told me at breakfast I was going to start helping the lady with taking care of her kids, instead of working at the horse barn, and so I went over there after school and sat with her and her kids, and her husband was working the swing shift in the factory, and when the kids went to sleep, she met me in the living room and I never…” Bird stared off as if she’d come to some great monument in her own mind and was beholding its beauty in awe. 

“Never what?”

“Ah. You don’t want to know.” 

“Sure, I do.” Eleonore leaned forward.

“We fell in love,” now, Bird turned her back to the fire and grabbed her wrist behind herself, holding her head back and closing her eyes. “We were absolutely in love. And somedays, I’d come to her and the kids after school, and the doors would be broken off the hinges around the house. Or there’d be smashed glass on the floor. Sometimes, she’d have a black eye. And when it was dark and the kids went to sleep, I’d tell her about how we could escape and we made plans to leave.”

“How long was it?”

“How long were we like that? Maybe, a month. Maybe, two. I don’t remember. I just know it was early in my junior year, and she had some money. I did, too.”

“What? She was going to leave her kids?”

“I don’t know, Eleonore. I don’t think we ever talked about it like that.”

“Hmm…” 

“We made plans to meet at the horse barn in the next town over, where I was working. And I snuck out of my window at the pastor’s house that night and waited in the starry morning by the barn. I waited for my hillbilly woman, but she never came.”

“What happened?”

“A couple of pickups pulled over on the side of the road in front of the horse barn, and in the back of one was a small band of men. They were wielding pitchforks and torches, and some were loading shotguns and walking towards the born. I saw her husband. And I knew… I knew she’d told him all about me. I knew she’d turned me in to him to save herself or got cold feet or something, and it hurt, but I didn’t have time. They had some dogs and were moving quick, so I buried myself in a huge mound of horse dung. I was in fear for my life, Eleonore, from the angry townspeople hunting me like a monster fled to the hills, and I never liked religion. But that night, that night I called on the name of the Lord and begged him to save me from the nightmare in which I found myself.”  

“I don’t like that you were going to take her from her husband, Bird. That’s not right.”

There was silence in the room. Bird cleared her throat and shifted her weight. She opened her eyes and stared at Eleonore, clenching her hidden teeth in anger that that was all the fat, farm woman had to say about it. It was another moment, before she spoke to say,

“And what about you?”

“What about me?”

“You’re married, are you not?” Bird pointed at her fat ring finger and the thin silver band on it. 

“Yes. You know that.”

“You haven’t told me that. I don’t see any pictures of him in here, but you have the ring. You act like a married woman, too.”

“Act like a married woman? And what does that mean?”

“Where is he? You must not be happy about it.”

“Beau Smith is a good man.”

“He’s a good man?” Bird drew the words, incredulous and mocking. “Why don’t you have children? Don’t you want children?” 

Now, Elenore stood and looked out into the fading daylight and set her gaze upon the barn in the distance and touched her teeth. It was a fidgety few moments, before she spoke, saying,

“That’s none of your business. I’m sorry for the misunderstanding, here. I’ll be retiring for the night. If you’re hungry, you can get whatever you like. Good night.”

Bird reached for the woman as she passed and collapsed onto the couch dejected and shaking her head. Eleonore’s bedroom doors slammed shut.",stories,Eleonore and her Bird,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lkz7e5/eleonore_and_her_bird/,1613433846.0

OK. I insulted him. I mean really? ""Can't a guy take a fucking joke?!"" I thought as I drove my Ford Mustang back to base at Camp Pendleton. 

STORY - As I Remember it

This is what I was thinking years ago when I was a PFC in the Marine Corps and Sgt. Torres had wanted me to take him on a drive off base to Oceanside California back in 1978.

We had just done a quick drive into town to run an errand and were now heading back. Things had gone well... No altercations... Nothin.'

Anyway Sgt. Torres was going on and on about how many girls he was banging. How the Ladies couldn't keep their hands off of him...blah, blah, blah. How he had a cooler car than mine. How I smoked too much. How he outranked me. Wasn't I looking forward to thirty days of boring-ass guard duty? ""Ha! Ha! Ha! Bucklin you are going to be bored shitless! ""etc. etc. You know - that kind of tormenting one-sided conversation that just goes on and on. 

It was getting to the point where I regretted giving the jerk a ride in the first place. Didn't this dude ever shut up?! Plus I was starting to wish I could kick his talkative ass out of my car. Hell! Let em' walk the rest of the way back to base. 

But no. That would have repercussions. I'd probably be assigned to even worse duty than having to schlep an M-16 rife around an armory building for thirty days. And that was bad enough. 

So instead I lit up a Marlboro Cigarette and said ""Hey, Sgt. Torres where did you get that t-shirt? 

He visibly puffed up at that question and said"" My Okinawan Girlfriend gave it to me before I left... It says ""Star"" in Japanese. ""

"" Uh, huh,"" I said taking a turn towards the main exit. ""Really?"" 

""Yeah, he said She was just one of the many muchachas I was seeing when I was stationed down by Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa."" 

""Oh yeah? "" That t-shirt doesn't say"" Star"" on it... I took some Japanese in College and that says somethin' else. "" I lied spectacularly. 

""Oh, what does it say?"" he said, starting to look uncomfortable. 

""Uh, I really don't want to say Sgt. Torres I muttered. 

""Cmon PFC Bucklin... Tell me I promise I won't be pissed, he pressed. 

""Well..."" I said. 

 I took a drag on my cigarette.

""It says ""Asshole! ""

Sgt. Torres looked down at his red t-shirt with its Japanese lettering in shock and dismay. 

And just like that his machismo world suddenly toppled over like a child's building block toy. It was as if he had caught a glimpse of himself courtesy of PFC Bucklin of what a pompous and ridiculous ass he really was. 

We drove in silence for a few miles and he kept looking at his t-shirt. He'd then grumble things in Spanish that I didn't quite understand. But, I could tell that whatever he was saying - wasn't very flattering about his former girlfriend! I mean ""Puta"" and ""Puta de mierda"" sounded pretty derogatory to me. 

He looked so deflated I  kind of felt sorry for him. Then I started to feel like a First Class Prick. Goddammit! 

So I barked a laugh and said ""Just Kidding! I don't know what it says. I don't know any Japanese! C'mon, I am joking Sgt. Torres! ""

Sgt. Torres didn't say anything. He just looked out the car window for the rest of the trip. 

Well, at least I got him to shut up. 

When we got to base he got out of my car and slammed the car passenger door so hard my car rattled. He then stalked away. 

Later and not unexpectedly - I was informed that I had been assigned another thirty days of ""boring ass"" Guard Duty much to my chagrin. 

In the Military - Paybacks' a bitch.

215,DeathWatch2003,1613441560,"I'd put a tub of ice cream outside my door (it's a Minnesotan winter rn and live in the sticks) cuz the freezer was full and I went out one morning to grab it as I was gonna make root beer floats. I looked outside the door for my ice cream and the fucker was /GONE/. I looked around outside to see if some how the wind may have blown it. I looked for about half hour (I /REALLY/ wanted my root beer float) in -25°F weather. Then it clicked....the neighbors dog....Murphy.
   As too why I thought of Murphy is because before I'd decided to put my Cokes outside to get cold and caught him taking off with a whole damn can in his mouth. And you see Murphy is a completely snow white dog....except for his head...its brown so it looks like you dunked a very large dogs head in brown paint and that's the only brown part of em. It was in the middle of a snow storm and seeing him taking off, all of him dissapeared into the snowstorm besides his brown head.
   Anyways back to the original story, I sent a text over to Murphys owner asking him if Murphy happened to show up with a gallon tub of ice cream. A few hours go by and I hear that ding from my phone go off (I have the TextNow app so it's got it's own distinct sound) and I knew right there what I was to expect. Murphy had taken my ice cream...
   Now this wasn't very suprising as over the last year or so they've been my neighbors with Murphy and I've gotten to see him grow up from a baby and comes over to my place to play with my dogs every day. He's learned to scratch at my door to let me know hes here and wants to play with Riley and Katana (my German Shepard and Pomsky) as he watches my dogs scratch when they want to come back in.
    Though over this past year and a half hes happened to take off with other things such as tennis balls, Stuffed chew toys....blankets.
   But now to the ending his owner got me another tub of ice cream (I told him it was fine that he didnt have too, was just tracking down my lost ice cream) and got to settle down that night happy with my Root Beer float watching Hellboy with my pups. They got some too:)",stories,The Lost Ice Cream,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lkt9x7/the_lost_ice_cream/,1613412760.0

It happened on a ruddy Thursday afternoon. I'd argue that, being neither in the exact epicenter nor in the tail-end of the week, Thursday's too bland a day for anyone to feel something, even going as far to die and then mourn. How wrong was I. 

It had just stopped raining, and the setting sun, a huge red fireball sadly lingering in the sky, almost imperceptibly retreated to the hidden backside of the so faraway hills. A huge transmission antenna tried to raise a mechanical hand against the heavens, the dominion of the gods; its only response was to be invariably cloaked, just like the rest of this meditative spinning globe, by night's cape of darkness. Until then, I did not knew what death was; such a strange word to utter, to signal a feeling so outlandish, so otherworldly,  so far away from my household and my childish innocence. I had barely heard from it, and when I'd heard it, it was trough the frightened, astonished and saddened gasps that usually followed an acquaintance's announcement that someone had died. I knew nothing of caskets, of wakes, of tall, menacing candles that sidelined each side of the coffin. Above it, a crucifix; the image of an innocent man in agonizing pain above the body of an innocent man who was already dead. Had I not known that dead innocent man, would death still stir the same repulsion and fear it stirs in me today? After profound and prolonged meditation, I believe the answer to that question to be ""yes"", for since  the day he died, other people close to me - sometimes friends, members of the family, acquaintances - have met this profoundly grave and morbid fate, and my fascination and repulsion of it will remain unchanged. 

I was no more than six, and the world for me still was all that I could see: the clouds and the hills and the neighborhood and the antenna was the world, the television and the books were mere fictional counterparts of it, separated by a thick layer of distorted glass. The man in the coffin was in his seventies; I knew him all my life, even the parts that I no longer remembered. According to people who were close to him, I was only part of his latter life, but whenever he looked at me, he felt like I had been part of it all along. He was a poor man whose only strengths were his family - a loyal wife and a brilliant daughter - and since the dawn of the new millennium, me, and his work, his earnest, sweated, hard-earned work. His job was to build houses, houses for people he never knew, houses for people he knew all his life. Eventually, having amounted a humble amount of money, bathed and gained with the sweat of his brow and the force of his determination, he was able to build his own little house, his own sceptered isle, his little world in where he'd live and care for his happy breed. Even being a humble, poor man, he'd always indulge me with my every wish, or to more accurately put it, the ones that wouldn't result in mindless spending. Riding his own rusted, long-lived bicycle through the dusty sand streets, we'd ride at sundown, me in tow, to get me in and out of the little world outside my little world, my school. It took a while for me to make friends, but I always knew my best would come by the lazy twilight to take me on ride home in his bicycle. Then I began to walk with my own feet, and the earnest man grew sick. 

The earnest, kind old gentlemen with the well-worn plain  shirt who rode at sunrise with his bicycle had always been a kind of tall and bony, thin sort of man. That absolutely did not stopped him from falling in love and building a family. But sometime after his seventh anniversary, he began to act strangely and much of his dispositions and pollyannesque adoration of life began to disappear. His complexion became more thin and bony than normal, until he became somewhat closer to a living cadaver than a human being per se. He gradually lost his capability to rationalize and form coherent words. The earnest man, still alive, became a frightening premonition of himself in the future. The boy he so much adored watched everything with quiet inquietation. He followed his also much beloved mother and grandmother hop in and out of physicians and hospitals, surgeries and medications, still trying to figure out why his beloved grandfather did not rode with him in tow in his bicycle through the dissolving streets, or why they were always traveling from one town to another, to one hospital to another, with his grandpa never fully talking, always blabbering like a baby. The wind swept the sand off the coast of the asphalt roads. The bicycle began to rust under the sun and the rain. The boy began to grow accustomed with that relatively eclectic routine, and continued to walk to and back from school by himself. 

Until Thursday arrived. A Thursday in August. Until that particular Thursday, all other Thursdays and all other Augusts had been blandness over blandness, infinite blandness from sunrise until dusk. The wind softly combed the wild green hair of the leaves that grew in uncut branches atop a neighbour's wall; the streets had been recently washed by an unforeseen downpour that lasted about an hour and a half. Then the sun rose once more to dry the asphalt, and beckon the birds to sing one last elegy. The school day began and went by, and the boy went home looking up, amazed, at the shades of peachy  rose and red that made up that afternoon's palette of the sky. 

Then, still parading down the cement sidewalk with one feet rhythmically after the other, his blurred vision allowed him to see the dense mass of people gathering like a flock of human sheep in front of his house. The strange sight sent him running faster than greased lightning, running right into one of life's darkest secrets. He came back from school and, for the first time in his life, saw people mourning. Years later, after finally understanding the meaning of the word, he wept, but by then it was far too late.",stories,"Coming back home from school, I see people mourning",https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lknzf9/coming_back_home_from_school_i_see_people_mourning/,1613396650.0

**A R R I V A L**

Last March I inherited a house, from a distant relative, an uncle, I’ve never met in my life.

From  the stories I’ve heard, he was like the... “eccentric uncle” of the  family. The only things I knew about him was that he was very old (born  in 1923), he had no wife or kids, he had been constantly travelling, and  that he was briefly involved in politics, in the 1950s. Nothing more.  It was an enormous, unexpected and unbelievable surprise when I was  specifically mentioned in his will to get this house! Surreal.

So, last June, I went with some friends to check it out.

The  house is in the middle of nowhere (nearest village is 20km away) in  Arcadia, up in the mountains of the Peloponnese, in Greece, almost a  4-hour drive from Athens. It was built sometime in the 19th century and  it has been locked and uninhabited, for at least, the last 17 years (my  uncle was in a decade-long coma).

We arrived there around noon.

The  house is surrounded by walnut trees and it’s a small, typical  Greek-village-style, made-out-of-stone house. A ground floor with 2  rooms and a kitchen, and a 1st floor, with another room and a bathroom,  and a small storage room behind the house. Nothing fancy. But beautiful.

The  second day we were there, and while at the storage room trying to fix  the plumbing, we found a door, behind a huge boiler thing. It was almost  as if it was hidden on purpose (wasn’t even visible if you didn’t know  where to look) and it was locked. We tried all the keys I had, a whole  bunch of them, but no luck. We searched the storage room and the house  for a key, but again, no luck.  At the end we had to break the lock, and  behind the door, were some stairs, going down to a basement. A  basement, which I did NOT know that the house had!

I so much remember the smell.

Dusty  and... spiderwebby. Not unpleasant, surprisingly, but strange. It was  like you could smell the darkness, and the years. And I also remember  the cold air that was coming out, way way cooler than the outside  temperature (it was ultra-hot that day, like 40 degrees Celsius)

Well, we all got chills, you know.

And we were a bit nervous I must confess.

When we got our torches and went back to the storage room, one of my friends grabbed a small axe.

*“What?”*

*“Just in case,”*

he said half-jokingly

*“I feel safer”*

and when we made fun of him, he was shaking his head at us: *“haven’t you watched any horror movies? A bunch of happy campers going down a dark basement? Don’t you remember Evil Dead?”*

LOL I still laugh about it...

Short  story long, we decided to try and fix the lights before going down the  stairs. Thankfully the electrics of the house were functional, so, a  couple of new lightbulbs later, and we were back in the 21st century,  with a well-lit stairway. It was time to explore.

I went down there first.

Carefully.

I  slowly walked into the basement and it felt like I was stepping into  another era. I quickly located the lights and gradually, lightbulb by  lightbulb, there was light, and it was, it was... unexpectedly friendly,  like an old library, at first glance. Full of books, heaps of them,  books  e v e r y w h e r e, and maps, globes, a big vintage radio and  other, strange looking machines. There was a large cabinet full of sea  shells and another cabinet, with small statues and figurines. One wall  was covered, top to bottom, with wooden, tribal-looking masks. The  ceiling, was like an astronomical map of sorts.

*“Wow”* I thought, *“was uncle John an art collector or something…? WTH is going on?”*

We were stoked. It really felt like an Indiana Jones movie!

I also remember myself thinking: *“OMG I’m gonna be rich”* lol

We  spent hours down there, and the fact that it was cooler than outside,  made it even better! There were countless interesting things to check  out, it was like we were in a storage room of a weird museum, a museum  of curiosities!

Books. So many books.

Shelves,  and boxes, and drawers, all filled with books. Mostly categorized  chronologically, as far as I could tell at the moment and some of them,  were really old! Printed in the 1850s, or in 1792 or even 1724!

There  was a beautiful, metal planetarium, decorated with jewels(!), an insect  collection, a huge (1m tall) metal rooster, another huge, wooden statue  of a man with an elephant head, and so many other peculiar (sometimes  even unidentifiable) objects everywhere around us. The statues/figurines  and the seashell collections alone, could take hours to explore.

There  was also another, smaller room in the back, with a sofa, two armchairs,  and a desk. On the desk, just a monitor, a keyboard and a lamp. And it  was in that room, behind some paintings stacked up against a wall, where  we found a locked chest.

When I saw the padlock on it, I immediately *knew* that I had the key.

Weeks  before, from the very first moment I was given the keys for the house, I  had noticed the small, black, rough, handmade-looking key, with two  small Omegas (the Greek letter) engraved on each side of it. I was  certain, that it was meant for this lock.

Surprising my friends, I said *“wait!”*  and theatrically took the keys out of my pocket. I inserted the small  black key into the padlock... and it worked! Another Indiana Jones  moment.

I opened the chest slowly thinking again *“oh yeah, I am going to be rich”* and it was ...full of books.

More books. Small, leather bound, identical notebooks to be precise.

I started taking them out so I could check below them, when a friend said:

*“Oh look, these are diaries!”*

We all looked at her. She looked back, pointing at one of the notebooks.

*“You see, here, a year. This one’s 1959. And this one is 1947, 1948, look, 1980, 81... it’s all here!”*

I looked at the notebooks. On every cover, on the upper left corner, were two Omegas and 4 numbers.

My friend started reading from one of them:

*Thursday,  February 6. Houston. I was B31. Met with Oliver, Grace and Harriet.  Must prepare for their visit in Athens next month. // Had dinner with  Rex. Wonderful person, can be trusted.*

She flipped through some pages and continued to read:

*Tuesday,  March 18. Belgrade. I was V9. Finalised contract for s. James. //  Dinner at Embassy. I was E4. // Felix informed he is retiring next  month.*

*“You see, it’s a diary!”*

Our  jaws dropped to the floor. They were 67 notebooks, one for every year,  from 1936 to 2003. My uncle kept an everyday log of what he was doing,  for almost 70 years!

There were  also some large (50×50cm) books in the chest. I grabbed one of them; it  was a photo album. The cover read:  ΩΩ // 1899-1935.

It  was mostly black and white pictures from that era. I thought it was a  family album at first, but then, I realised that in every photo, there  was always someone wearing a wooden tribal mask, like the ones on the  wall. There were also press clippings with various news items from the  first decades of the 20th century.

It  was weird. There were portraits, photos from weddings, from offices,  meetings, funerals, aboard boats, in parties, on horses, at castles,  trains, music clubs, group photos, anything you can imagine (and/or  expect in a photo album) but in every photo, always, there was at least  one person with a mask.

In some,  there were more than one! There were photos with 3, 4, even 10, or more  than 20 people in masks, like a convention or something. There were both  men and women, frequently in uniform and exotic dresses. There’s one  pic, where a group of masked persons with traditional, folk costumes  from all over the world, poses outside a small fleet of ... zeppelins.  And then they have a kind of party, inside one of them! A frigging  zeppelin!

And all the photos were  dated! In the back of each photo, was a date, names, and location. I  tried to recognise something, a member from my family, a house, a place,  you know, something, but I couldn’t.

But then, after a couple of pages, I *did* recognize someone.

It  was a photograph I’ve seen before, in history books, at school. A photo  from 1913, of a famous Greek politician and PM at the time, Eleftherios  Venizelos, with King Constantine I of Greece. But this version of the  photograph, wasn't like the one I’ve seen in books.

This one wasn’t cropped. It was wider, so you could see the whole picture.

Next to the two men, and wearing some sort of military uniforms, were another 2 men, in masks.

I  picked up another photo album, ΩΩ // 1962-1974, and again, random pics  of people with masks but this time, man oh man, I knew most of the  people in the photos.

Politicians,  heads of state, popes, kings, queens, pop idols, athletes, actors,  astronauts, TV personalities, every single famous person of the 60’s was  in this album.

From Buzz Auldrin to the Dalai Lama and from Picasso to Sagan to Zappa, *everybody*  was in there. Mao Zedong was in there, drinking tea with a masked  parson! Queen Elisabeth was in there! Martin Luther King Jr. was in  there! Even Elvis was there! Elvis, in a private jet, sitting next to a  masked person *(was he my uncle?)* and then Elvis and the masked man, in the White House, meeting president Nixon! Surreal.

The notes behind the Elvis picture read: *""21/12/71, LA to Washington DC""*

I opened the 1971 notebook, searched for December and there it was:

*“Monday,  December 21. Winter solstice. Washington. I was A7 -- Flight from Los  Angeles was a disaster, Elvis wants to cancel the wedding. Lunch at the  White House. // I was V9. Dinner at Mrs. Sundrop with Lucy A. and  Frank.”*

I was stunned. And  excited. I don't know why (it’s weird now that I think about it) but my  first thought was to check for my birthday. I looked for the noteboo-- *DRiiiiiNNGGG*

A phone rang.

*(”a phone?”)*

The ringing sound was coming from the other room.

*DRiiiiiNNGGG*

I looked at my friends. *(”it isn’t one of ours, is it?)* They were ALL looking at me.

*DRiiiiiNNGGG*

*“House DOESN’T have a landline""* I tell them, and we turn into iceblocks.

*DRiiiiiNNGGG*

We unfroze and ran to the other room.

An old, analogue phone was on the floor.

*DRiiiiiNNGGG*

I  picked it up, with all my friends bumping their heads on mine and  each-others as they squeezed their ears as close to the receiver as  possible, and

224,Kheletor,1613398764,"It was a dark night of January, one would have assumed it rained outside, but the geodesic dome that made up the ceiling of the Central Park arena was reflecting a comforting, but shallow moonlight sky, it was projected on a loop that made it seem like the clouds were moving, but everyone with a keen eye could have spotted a little freeze of about five seconds in the animation that signaled the end of the loop. It was under this artificially generated environment that Luna and Jones met again for the first time after the the incident that left the girl partially deaf. As the gates that led into the arena opened, storming the gladiator's quarters with lights of every color and noise of every kind, Jones immediately started scanning the crowd, anxious to catch sight of her. He spotted Animatronica first, and Luna was sitting immediately next to her. It took only a sight for Jones to boot up the internal memory drive that contained the events of the night of the incident, those memories were a gift from her: a compilation of the most important moments the two of them spent together, copied directly from her brain. Jones held greedily onto those memories, they were all he had to remember her. She was Luna, the second and most beloved daughter of the Leviathan, much to her older half-sister Animatronica's envy. She used to spend her days living as a spoiled princess under the ever watchful eye of Iron Jones, her silent but terrifying cyborg guardian. Luna, however, despised the glamorous life that had been chosen for her and, like most eighteen year olds, yearned for adventure and freedom. So, on a most baleful night, the girl, moved by her insatiable curiosity, rashly decided to sneak out of her father's grand palace in Liberty Island to discover what secrets the Big Apple held. What she found left her shocked: a New York City full of the technological wonders she was accustomed to, on one hand, but a cruel and cold city of steel on the other, where only the most high-tech individuals can hope to survive, and where there's no mercy for the obsolete. She was lost, swallowed by the metropolis, like a miniscule bolt in a huge, living machine drowning in a sea of lights. It was during this first experience with freedom, that Luna came to learn how her status of daughter of the Leviathan wasn't as much of a privilege as she thought. Somebody had recognized her in one of the darker alleys of the lower conglomerates. Cyber-criminals, jackals, they seemed to be coming out of the various spots of shadow that the neon failed to illuminate, as they quickly surrounded the girl. They were grinning, while showing all sorts of crude, mechanical implants probably purchased on the street for a buck. They said they intended to ask for ransom, but their true intentions were as clear as day. Fortunately, Jones had been on Luna's trail all along and he acted most quickly to rescue her. A furious fight ensued between him and the criminals, that ended with the latters being slaughtered like pigs of flesh and metal on the concrete floor bathed in neon, but not before one of them, in an attempt to hold Jones off, cut away one of Luna's ears and threatened to kill her to no avail. After this cruel baptism of blood, the wounded and traumatized girl was taken home by her rescuer, who, a few days later, got heavily scolded and blamed by the Leviathan for what happened. But, rather unexpectedly, before the dictator could have expressed any punishment for the cyborg, Luna stepped in. She was now sporting a rounded, sleek, cybernetic hearing aid in place of the missing ear that linked directly into her brain and allowed her to hear and dialogue with most machines; it was the latest in the field of acoustic engineering, only the japs had stuff like that. She was wearing it proudly under the temple she had cut her hair to better show it off. The girl was there to defend her Jones, who couldn't do much to defend himself but remain silent and scowling all throughout, having his voice and memories been purposefully suppressed by the Leviathan himself during programming, so that he could take out his anger on the cyborg without consequences. Jones stood there, motionless as he watched Luna take his side with fervour, as she stood up to her father who tried to shut her up. She demonstrated a maturity Jones had never seen before, and she looked even prettier all mad like she was. At the end of the day, the dictator had to give in and Jones was let go clean. When they met outside, in the hallway of the grand palace, the cyborg gave Luna a look he never gave to anyone else and that she interpreted as interrogative, so she smiled and gestured him to come closer with one finger:""It's what friends do"", she whispered to Jones as she thanked him with a kiss and a caress on the cheek. The memories ended there. 
Luna was excited beyond words to see her Jones again on that night of January at Central Park, that had now been turned into an underground arena where mutant monsters are forced to kill each other for people's amusement. Jones fought there regularly, in order to consolidate his status of cruel and terrifying reaper and to inspire fear in anyone who planned to defy the regime. Luna was there with her older half-sister, and while Animatronica clearly didn't want to be there, but had to just to patch up Jones between fights, Luna wouldn't have wanted to be in any other place. She wanted to watch him fight, her eyes full of desire and lust, completely entranced by the cacophony of screams and shouts that rose from the bleachers, by the smell of synthetics snacks that had just been rehydrated, and most importantly, by Jones himself as he was about to tear his way through the next opponent. His movements were what caught her attention the most, she could have spent an eternity watching him fight. His moves were extremely precise and calculated but still very plastic and physical, it was like a silent harmony of fists and kicks covered in blood and guts. That was his language, his only way of expressing what he felt. Luna couldn't do but wonder if Jones would have thought of her, when fighting so fiercely as he did the night he saved her life...she wondered if maybe there was a beating heart beneath that scowling look on his face and those muscles of steel...and if it beats just like her own beats at thought of him. Luna's chain of thoughts was interrupted by the flat, computer-generated voice of the holographic referee that announced the beginning of the fight. Her lustful eyes focused again and met the white optic sensors of her Jones, that was giving her one last look with all the warmth a machine could ever manage to output. She felt her heart beat louder and louder, as the cyborg’s violent harmony was about to commece  once a gain.",stories,A cyberpunk story I've written tonight because I wasn't able to sleep.

My step dad didn't believe in all of that, all the flowers and cards, but he showed he loved my mom in so many other ways. He polished her work shoes every night, he went out at 10:30 every night to clean the snow off her car and warm up the car for her. 
He had coffee waiting for her, the dishwasher emptied and the kitchen cleaned every morning when she came home from working the night shift at the local dinner.

My mom told him she loved him every day, she made sure he had his glass of wine every night at dinner. She worked right beside him on every project they did on our house, that's love, that's what they showed to each other all year long  and that showed me what true love was.

Look I am as romantic as the next person, maybe more so,as I am a Libra after all, but believe me if I could have given back every flower or phony card to have my ex treat me good for the other 364 days a year, instead of this one day. Trust and believe, I would have, in a heartbeat.

Then tell me why do we need these ""Days"" to remind us to do something nice? Valentine's day, Mother's day, Father's day? Hell we even have a national ""Eat dinner with your kids"" day. Really? Do you need a national day to remind you to do that?
That is what is wrong in today's society, it's an all about me world, you don't put someone's else's needs before your own. You're so busy doing you, you need a day to remind you to be sweet or kind.

I brought my mom flowers every week, just because I wanted her to know I loved her. Even when I moved 1500 miles away I still had them sent to her every Friday. I gave her and my dad cards all the time just to say I love you and thanks for putting up with me or I miss you when I moved. I give my girls cards just because...I want them to know I love them and how proud I am of them. 

I am constantly calling friends and family telling them I love them and I miss them, I don't need a day to do that, I want them to know it all year long.
Yes, cards and flowers are wonderful on Valentine's day but if that is the only time you say I love you, then save your money, because it means nothing on this phony day.

So today my friends, take my advice, tell the people that are in your life that you love them, every day not just this day, send them a card, drop flowers off on a Thursday. Pick up the phone, call on the way home, let them know the other 364 days a year that they are important in your life. And one last thought, for you singles out there, don't be sad your single, enjoy your singleness, buy yourself flowers, go out with friends. I can tell you for a fact that not all you see with your married friends is paved with gold.

This valentine's day, I will be loving myself, I slept in, had breakfast with my girls,and will just chill with this broken ass arrm whatever you do, just be kind to yourself, you are important as well. Love yourself, love your family and friends, love your life...
You only have one life to make it the best, live large, love big!

Happy Valentine's day to all of my readers and to the rest of you ...well you know how I feel all year long...love you to pieces!

Be the change you want to see""

227,ThaWalrusMan,1613390880,"What happened a few days ago left me very shaken, to say the least. I even took a few days off to go over everything and make sense of it all. I’m still trying to piece together what all had happened. From what I remember, there was a screaming orb of pure light racing around the library and next thing I know, I’m on my ass staring up at nothing except shadows. That’s all I can remember. I awoke to getting kicked in the ribs by one of the day shift workers. He had told me that he found me in a puddle of my own piss and he also thought I might be concussed. I asked him why he thought that and he took a picture of my face, then showed it to me. A massive knot had formed on my forehead just over my left eye.

“Listen, I don’t know what the hell you get yourself into some nights, but you have to be more careful. I’m getting sick of having to wake you up.”

As he said this, I drooped my head in shame and left for the day. I spent all day sitting in my dingy apartment just trying to mull over what had happened and subsequently what could have caused this. Whenever I would get too deep into thought; however, a sudden movement from my peripheral vision would always pull me out of my trance. Every time I would go to sleep, I would feel something watching me. Having worked at the library for so long, I became familiar with this kind of feeling. But this… it felt different than usual.

Let’s start off with the fact that I am at home. Normally when I am at home, all the creepy shit from the library stays around the library and doesn’t follow me here. That damned shadow followed me here. I know it sounds absolutely ludicrous but I know it did. That shadow that has been following me around for the past few days is scary as shit, don’t get me wrong, but it's familiar. Every time I would go and turn on a light to a room, I would feel safer; but, only just. That feeling of being watched would only go from being in front of me to behind me. 

Since I’m not made of money, I couldn’t keep my lights on all the time to help alleviate this feeling. It was honestly dreadful. Whenever I would turn some lights out, I noticed that specific areas were a lot darker than others. Like a lot darker. I came to the conclusion that... that *thing*… followed me home. 

The reason why I finally took some days off is because I had never had anything like this happen before. I was shook. How can I go from being hunted down by a flying ghost orb end up with me being hit in the head and waking up to a coworker (who might I add is a massive asshole) kicking me in the ribs to wake me up?

I’m finally back at work and I haven’t gotten much sleep at all over the last few days. The feeling of unease is weighing down on me tonight. When I went to unlock the main doors after my first set of rounds, I felt as if something was off. I didn’t notice anything that would make me feel this way for a few hours. When Emmett came in, that’s when I finally put two and two together. That shadow that is always outside, wasn’t there. Now yes, I know you’re going to say, “But it’s night time, there are shadows everywhere.” I know. This one wasn’t where it should be.

I sat at my desk, patiently watching that area for the majority of the night. As I sat there, I just started getting more and more angry at seemingly nothing. The other night's proverbial shit storm left me shaken, but this shadow left me pissed. I had it with this. I couldn’t think straight anymore. I slammed my hands down on my desk and shot up to walk outside. As I neared the first set of doors, that feeling of unease starting setting back in, and fast. I didn’t care though, I had to see what the hell was causing me all this distress. When I got outside, I started screaming.

“What the fuck do you want with me? Why did you follow me home? Why are you driving me insane?! What the hell di-”

“What is wrong, David?” said a ghastly, shrill voice. It continued, “Is everything alright?”

That voice chilled me to my core. Worst part was, it came from directly behind me. Cold air rushed down my neck as I felt it breathing. 

“Y’know what? No, nothing is alright as a matter of fact.” I snapped back. “Whatever the fuck you are, you’ve been scaring the absolute shit out of me since day one, not to mention the fact that you fucking followed me home! How in the hell would everything be alright? How would you feel if a creepy shadow demon followed you home and watched you for days on end? I bet it wouldn’t be all that pleasant, huh?”

“Your hostility is misplaced, David. If it were not for me and my plans for you, you would not have survived. I need you David. We all do.” 

I tried turning around to see what I was speaking to, but as I did so, cold hands placed themselves on my shoulders, forcing me to stay looking forward. I glanced down at the hands and to be perfectly honest, I wish I hadn’t. Small and boney hands with black, razor sharp talons kept me in place. 

“What in the fuck are you?” I stammered. 

Right as I had said this, I felt the weight of the two hands leave my shoulders. I was now all alone. I shot around to try and find out what I had been talking to, but was met with nothing else except the front doors to the library. With a defeated sigh, I went back inside. 

As I approached my desk, something clicked. *My fucking pens.* I broke into a light jog to check on my beloved writing utensils. I got within a few feet of my desk and I saw the top of something's head. I could see the tips of ears dashing back and forth and the end of a tail peek over the top of my shelf.

“Hey, drop that right now!” I shouted. 

Right as I made my presence known, what looked to be the head of a cat shot up and met my gaze. I froze in place, trying not to scare the little creature more than I probably already had. Two red, beady eyes studied me. Its eyes took up the majority of its already tiny head. With both of its large, disc like ears, pointed towards me, it hopped up onto the shelf. I finally got a good look at it for once. 

It stood on two hind legs, fully showing off its body. In all, it was a very odd creature. The head of a very small cat, body of a monkey, and the tail of what looked like a lemur. Its little hands?...paws?...were wrapped around a pen. MY pen. 

“Listen here ya little shit. Put that down. That cost a whole two bucks.” With this being said, it started turning its head as if it were a confused dog. I think it was trying to figure out what I was saying.  
“The pen. Drop It.” 

It looked at the pen. Then to me. Back to the pen. To the side of the desk. Then back to me. During this whole interaction, I tried not to move at all for fear of scaring it. It was like a shitty Mexican standoff. I had to make a move if I was going to save my pen that was currently being held hostage by whatever the hell this thing was. 

With a resigned, *fuck it*, I shot forward with my arms outstretched so I can grab the little shit. Instead of it jumping off of the desk, it instead jumped onto my arm. From there it ran up to my shoulder then jumped on my head and started beating my forehead with my pen. I think it hurt more that it was MY pen. Not just a random one, but MINE. 

Once the little shit asserted its dominance, it jumped off of my head and two flaps of skin spread out to let it glide down to the ground. It ran to the small door leading inside my desk, opened it, stared at me, then went inside slamming the door. 

Tonight was very strange. I guess that’s what I get when I take a few days off of work. I have to do my last round and figure out where Emmett is. I don’t even know what to do with whatever that thing is that stole my pen. All I know for sure is I need to plan another trip to the dollar store.",stories,I Work the Night Shift at a Library Part 3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lkcfrm/i_work_the_night_shift_at_a_library_part_3/,1613362080.0
228,MotionSparxx,1613388639,"You're at a bar waiting for your head of security Sam and his newly recruited replacement Andy. It's been a crazy week so you prefer this ""meet and greet"" on the casual side. 

Checking your watch you notice that he's 10 minutes behind so you decide to give him a call. On the second ring you hear his weather worn voice on the other end and without missing a beat he immediately berates you for your choice of meeting place because of the traffic in the area. 
You laugh it off and tell him to relax, promising him drinks on his arrival to celebrate his retirement. 

You hear a cackle of his laughter on the line ""now there's something to look forward to"" he says ""remember, I only drink bourbon.The expensive kind. Preferably with an attractive woman on my lap."" 
You laugh at that and joke that Sam can't actually tell bourbon from whiskey or scotch. 
""Just get my damned drink ready. I'll be there in half an hour."" you hear the click on the other line indicating he's ended the call. 

A few minutes later the bell above the bar door chimes. A lady walks in, scans the bar and spots the empty bar stool next to you. She makes her way over and asks if the seat is free. You smile and offer the seat thinking that you, Sam and the replacement can get a booth later when they arrive. 

""Thanks"" She smiles in gratitude, takes a seat and looks over the bar and orders a drink. 
She's cute and Sam is taking some time to arrive so you strike up a conversation with her. She's smart and funny and new in town; but as the conversation carries on, you also notice her looking furtively over to 2 guys seated at a table behind you.
 
You quietly ask if the men are bothering her. ""They've been looking over here a lot since I sat down."" She says quietly. Noticing the tinge of discomfort in her tone, you offer to go over and talk to the men but she quickly stops you. ""It's alright, I don't want to make a scene."" she says nervously. 

You assure her that it won't be an issue because you own the bar along with many other establishments on that street and she'll be safe with you. You note the surprise on her face followed by a doubtful look. ""this isn't a line is it?"" she asks. 

You laugh and call your bartender Issac over to vouch for you. ""Oh yeah he's the big boss around here."" He grunts in response ""Good ol slave driver he is""  
She laughs at that and seems appeased. 
You give your assurances and get her another drink. You notice her glancing over the two men again. She looks a little worried now. 

To ease her mind you offer her to drink with you in your office located at the end of the bar away from the patrons. You also tell her it has an door leading to the back so she can leave without going through the front door later. She's abit dubious but finally agrees after a bit more convincing . You leave a quick word to the bartender to tell Sam where to find you. 

You lead the way to your office through a short corridor with her in tow. As you enter your office, the noise of the bar dies down. But as you close the door the two men from the bar suddenly barge in, throwing you off balance and almost tripping you. 

You demand an explanation but one of them lands a punch to your abdomen. You double over from the pain and try to get back at them, only to have a second punch land on your jaw. You glance over at your lady as you grapple with the first guy whose accomplice is now walking towards her. 

You frantically tell her to leave out the door next to her and yell at the second guy to leave her alone. Suddenly, you hear a loud crack and the guy you were fighting falls unconscious. You see Sam standing above him with a retractable baton in his hand. You comment on Sam's timing and quickly move off to the side to get to your lady but suddenly stop when you see her deliver a neat roundhouse to the second guy's jaw knocking him out cold. 

""Local thugs"" Sam says recognizing the unconscious figures sprawled on thefloor. ""Usually specializing in kidnap for ransom."" You're half listening at this point cause you are focused on your lady. She's on her phone with the police and barely rattled. 

Sam inquires after you again to check if you're hurt. You wave him off and approach your lady to inquire after her and comment on how she was able to knock out a guy twice her size but also mention that she must be pretty important for those guys to get her. 

Before she can answer, Sam sees the exchange and laughs. You turn and ask him what's so funny? You're also a bit annoyed that Sam is taking a casual tone with her after the attempted kidnapping. 

Sam laughs again ""I think all that money of yours scrambled your brains man. That kidnapping was intended for YOU. We got word from a few guys that there would be a hit on you. Little Missy here was handy in combat because it was her JOB.""

That's when it suddenly dawns: She was never actually trying to get away from the men, she was trying to get YOU away from them by getting you into the office. 
She was never in any real danger because she was actually trying to protect you. 

You watch as she gives you an almost cocky smile as she extends her hand ""Pleasure to meet you again sir. I'm Andrea, your new head of security. But you can call me Andy""",stories,Protected,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lkbvu8/protected/,1613359839.0

Knock knock.

*Who is it?*

The banshee. 

*The banshee who?*

The banshee in a cloud of black dust, kicking at my hotel door, like the police, at 3 a.m. 

*Why is there a banshee in your hallway?*

That’s what I am wondering. I’m a naked man wearing only one slipper, hopping, my leg a pogo stick, to the door, to answer the beating.  

*What does the banshee look like?*

I squint my eye into the peephole. In the cloud of black dust, her silhouette solidifies, yields to form, and she cuts a striking character. 

The banshee is around 800 years old and 4-feet-tall, with duct tape crucifixes over her privates. She has the skin of a crocodile, and her arms and legs are thin as plastic straws. Her stomach is distended. Her hair is twin tufts of buzzing, interconnected insects. Her ears are pointy and unaligned and her bloodshot eyes are uneven too. 

Her face, however… I find most horrifying. It reminds me of a Halloween witch mask; it is a caricature of a caricature; a cartoonist blend of incongruous angles and broken bones. 

*What does the banshee want?*

It’s hard to say. 

The banshee clutches a scimitar in one of her shriveled hands; she’s got a whiskey bottle full of gasoline in the other. Already, the hallway stinks like a gas station… 

*Well, are you going to open the door?*

I unhook the lock, open my door a skosh, and a soft yellowy glow glistens in from the hallway. 

My hotel room is an ecosystem of introversion. It smells of foot fungus, man ass, and kimchi. There’re empty beer bottles in the doorway next to a half-eaten bag of salt and vinegar potato chips. There’s blood and hair in the sink and a cobra snake coiled in the toilet. The shower is a penis of progress. This... This all… the banshee understands. The banshee is not judgmental. 

The banshee clucks and clatters at the whiskey bottle, bopping it with the scimitar. Next, she unlooses the scimitar, lets it fall to the hallway’s hardwood floor. Triumphantly, she hoists the bottle of gasoline high and appears ready to douse herself, but then she lowers it, and cradles the bottle, brings the bottle to her face, gulps down the gasoline, in a quick sloppy slog, then lets out a loud wet belch…

Then she starts to dissolve, like ice cubes in a sauna, the banshee melting, entirely, into an effulgent silver stream, the stream powering like lava, and I hear her mutter something, in a strangled voice, about “false hope.” 

The silvery liquid pools and swirls on the hallway floor, then gathers, until it hardens, forms into a sheath, a sparkling silver sheath. The sheath sprouts millipede legs and scurries and scoots, slips perfectly over the scimitar. 

Knock knock.

*Who’s there?*

Scimitar. 

*Scimitar who?*

Wolfram exited his field barracks after hearing that another attack was to happen, since 5 days have gone by, more attacks have gone on. The capital of Luxemburg is almost reached, and The major cities of Antwerp, Liege, and the Capital Brussels was taken in Belgium. British troops were arriving slowly, but seemingly too late. When he got out of the tent, everyone was moving, multiple Panzer IV’s passed by. A half-track came by and one of his division members told him to jump in, he did so, he went ahead and started manning the MG34 mounted on it. They were heading to keep British and Belgian forces from breaching the gates to Brussels. Along with making a slight push into enemy territory. 

About a half hour later, Wolfram and the fighting squads arrived, the air felt quite cool for once in a while. Wolfram knew that it wouldn’t be long until enemy resistance though, so he cut his gazing at scenery short. Sure enough, soldier ahead yelled “Enemy forces to our frontside!”, the half-track raced forward ahead of the Panzer IV’s to the enemy position and stopped. Wolfram aimed his MG34 at the advancing Belgian and possible British forces and started firing, while the rest of his infantry men jumped out of the half-track and started fighting at combat positions. 

The quite fast firing MG34, chambered in. 7.92 x 57mm Mauser, made the enemy stand no chance. Due to this, the enemy started targeting the half-track, multiple bullets hit the two metal plates on both sides of the guns barrel. Eventually explosions started to ring out beside him, they were using grenades... The MG34 overheated and Wolfram had to wait for it to cool down, while so he ducked down and wiped the dirt and sweat from his face. While doing this, a British No. 23 grenade bounced in front of him in the half-track. Wolfram quickly tossed himself over the side and covered his head. The grenade exploded, raining pieces of metal all over him, the half-track was badly damaged and the fuel line was starting to catch fire. Wolfram wasn’t hesitant, he quickly got himself on his feet and went to a nearby small cliff cutoff to the land. The half-track exploded 15 seconds later, raining more metal everywhere. A few German soldiers flew forward from the concussive blast. 

Wolfram flanged his Kar98k from his shoulder to his arm, made sure a clip was in it, and put himself in position to fire. He shot a few Belgian soldiers, and then reloaded. As more fire on the people a few meters from him, he moved to a large tree. A rifleman moved right beside of him and started speaking “There’s a sniper up that hill in the house, he’s been picking us off quickly one by one, I need you to-“ the man couldn’t finish when a shot rang out, and a bullet went clean through the mans Stahlhelm, making him drop dead. The British Lee-Enfield No. 4 is powerful... Wolfram wiped the splattered blood from his face, he would not let his fellow soldiers death be in vain. He waited until the sniper thought that he wasn’t looking, but then he peeked around, he saw a flare and instantly ducked back around, narrowly missing the snipers bullet. 

He got the attention of some men firing at Belgian soldiers, “Hey! I need you to that sniper for me!” Wolfram yelled to the Unteroffizier. “I’m on it Unterfeldwebel!” He yelled back. Soon enough, some men started drawing the snipers fire towards them, this gave Wolfram his chance. He whipped around the corner, and carefully aimed his Kar98k with only iron sights at the 150 meter position. He could only see his head, so he fired, the bullet struck the snipers skull, making him drop dead to the ground. Wolfram pulled back his bolt and pushed it forward, wasting no time to wipe out more Belgians. The squads, including Wolfram now slowly started advancing on the Belgians, the Belgians saw how bad they were loosing, and most started fleeing, however some stayed. Whenever they reached the position, Wolfram put his Kar98k on his shoulder and unholstered his Walther P38, and snuck up on the back of a Belgian soldier, he then took the bottom of his pistol, and whipped it against the side of the Belgians head, making him fall over and drop his rifle, but not knocking him out. 

Wolfram then aimed his P38 at the mans head “Don’t try anything, and you won’t get hurt.” Wolfram spoke to the man in an intimidating tone. The man could not understand Wolfram well but knew what he meant, two men came in and picked up the man by the shoulders, and the man eventually stood up on his own, raising his hands. The man was escorted out to a prisoners transport truck. Wolfram holstered his P38, and exited the small building. Outside, prisoners were being escorted everywhere, the small village had been taken. Wolfram and his squad, along with other squads had succeeded once again. He hurried back to his squad to find only one was wounded, another half-track came to take them back to base, they deserved some chow.

Yesterday our OberstLeutnant spoke to us about leading the first charge from the Niederlande, and into Belgien und Luxemburg. I felt encouraged at the thought of this, I believe the Führer made great decisions honestly. We will be setting out for the conquest of Belgium today. Britisch and Französisch Intervention will happen as we know. We plan to take major cities as quick as possible, including their capital Brussels. We plan to use Blitzkrieg tactics to quickly encircle and capture troops. I must go now.... 

Wolfram Aichele closed his journal and stuffed it away in his forward pocket and picked up his new Model 40 Stahlhelm from his bed, putting it on. He grabbed his engraved Kar98k attached with a bayonet. He loaded up some clips on his clip belts and set off out of the barracks. People were gathering around at his regiment, preparing for the fight. Being a Unterfeldwebel, Wolfram made his way up towards the front of his assigned squad. A quick walking/marching formation with the Panzer IV’s down the road proved to not be bad later. They had reached the enemy area, everyone made sure all was clear. “Hey, got a light?” A guy to the right of him asked. “Sure.” Wolfram responded. The man stuck out his cigarette for Wolfram to light, which wolfram did. 

As soon as he put his lighter away, a gunshot rang out, then multiple, everyone started going to trained positions. Wolfram quickly ducked behind a tree. “Belgian troops rushing in!” A German yelled out. Wolfram turned from the tree and started aiming and shooting, using all 5 bullets effectively, each being at least hits in the chest. Wolfram went back around the tree and reloaded his Kar98k. At this point the Belgians saw his position and fired on him. So once the shots stopped, he made his move and ducked behind a big rock not to far from the tree. The Panzer IV mowed down the Belgian infantry from the right side, as another 10 squads arrived. Wolfram and a few others started firing on the limping squads on the left, Wolfram scored multiple hits. He went to reload his Kar98k whenever a Belgian man rushed on his position, multiple, the man flung his Kar98k into the rock, and tackled him to the ground. Wolfram unholstered his Walther P38, aimed it at the Belgian mans chest, and shot. The 9mm went through the Belgian man, and he went limp. Wolfram shoved the body off him quickly, holstered his Walther P38. And quickly picked up his Kar98k, reloaded it, and picked off a few more soldiers. A German soldier near him yelled “Granate raus!”, and threw his Stielhandgranate, seconds later an explosion rang out and multiple Belgian soldiers went down. When the dust cleared, no more gunshots, the area was carefully checked, nobody moved for another minute. The Leutnant in the frontmost Panzer IV Said “All clear!”, due to this, everyone moved back to the road, the wounded were being carried out by medics, Wolfram moved to patrol arms with his Kar98k and continued down the road. “So how was the cigarette?” He told the man beside him jokingly.

237,ThaWalrusMan,1613368545," What happened a few days ago left me very shaken, to say the least. I even took a few days off to go over everything and make sense of it all. I’m still trying to piece together what all had happened. From what I remember, there was a screaming orb of pure light racing around the library and next thing I know, I’m on my ass staring up at nothing except shadows. That’s all I can remember. I awoke to getting kicked in the ribs by one of the day shift workers. He had told me that he found me in a puddle of my own piss and he also thought I might be concussed. I asked him why he thought that and he took a picture of my face, then showed it to me. A massive knot had formed on my forehead just over my left eye.

“Listen, I don’t know what the hell you get yourself into some nights, but you have to be more careful. I’m getting sick of having to wake you up.”

As he said this, I drooped my head in shame and left for the day. I spent all day sitting in my dingy apartment just trying to mull over what had happened and subsequently what could have caused this. Whenever I would get too deep into thought; however, a sudden movement from my peripheral vision would always pull me out of my trance. Every time I would go to sleep, I would feel something watching me. Having worked at the library for so long, I became familiar with this kind of feeling. But this… it felt different than usual.

Let’s start off with the fact that I am at home. Normally when I am at home, all the creepy shit from the library stays around the library and doesn’t follow me here. That damned shadow followed me here. I know it sounds absolutely ludicrous but I know it did. That shadow that has been following me around for the past few days is scary as shit, don’t get me wrong, but it's familiar. Every time I would go and turn on a light to a room, I would feel safer; but, only just. That feeling of being watched would only go from being in front of me to behind me. 

Since I’m not made of money, I couldn’t keep my lights on all the time to help alleviate this feeling. It was honestly dreadful. Whenever I would turn some lights out, I noticed that specific areas were a lot darker than others. Like a lot darker. I came to the conclusion that... that *thing*… followed me home. 

The reason why I finally took some days off is because I had never had anything like this happen before. I was shook. How can I go from being hunted down by a flying ghost orb end up with me being hit in the head and waking up to a coworker (who might I add is a massive asshole) kicking me in the ribs to wake me up?

I’m finally back at work and I haven’t gotten much sleep at all over the last few days. The feeling of unease is weighing down on me tonight. When I went to unlock the main doors after my first set of rounds, I felt as if something was off. I didn’t notice anything that would make me feel this way for a few hours. When Emmett came in, that’s when I finally put two and two together. That shadow that is always outside, wasn’t there. Now yes, I know you’re going to say, “But it’s night time, there are shadows everywhere.” I know. This one wasn’t where it should be.

I sat at my desk, patiently watching that area for the majority of the night. As I sat there, I just started getting more and more angry at seemingly nothing. The other night's proverbial shit storm left me shaken, but this shadow left me pissed. I had it with this. I couldn’t think straight anymore. I slammed my hands down on my desk and shot up to walk outside. As I neared the first set of doors, that feeling of unease starting setting back in, and fast. I didn’t care though, I had to see what the hell was causing me all this distress. When I got outside, I started screaming.

“What the fuck do you want with me? Why did you follow me home? Why are you driving me insane?! What the hell di-”

“What is wrong, David?” said a ghastly, shrill voice. It continued, “Is everything alright?”

That voice chilled me to my core. Worst part was, it came from directly behind me. Cold air rushed down my neck as I felt it breathing. 

“Y’know what? No, nothing is alright as a matter of fact.” I snapped back. “Whatever the fuck you are, you’ve been scaring the absolute shit out of me since day one, not to mention the fact that you fucking followed me home! How in the hell would everything be alright? How would you feel if a creepy shadow demon followed you home and watched you for days on end? I bet it wouldn’t be all that pleasant, huh?”

“Your hostility is misplaced, David. If it were not for me and my plans for you, you would not have survived. I need you David. We all do.” 

I tried turning around to see what I was speaking to, but as I did so, cold hands placed themselves on my shoulders, forcing me to stay looking forward. I glanced down at the hands and to be perfectly honest, I wish I hadn’t. Small and boney hands with black, razor sharp talons kept me in place. 

“What in the fuck are you?” I stammered. 

Right as I had said this, I felt the weight of the two hands leave my shoulders. I was now all alone. I shot around to try and find out what I had been talking to, but was met with nothing else except the front doors to the library. With a defeated sigh, I went back inside. 

As I approached my desk, something clicked. *My fucking pens.* I broke into a light jog to check on my beloved writing utensils. I got within a few feet of my desk and I saw the top of something's head. I could see the tips of ears dashing back and forth and the end of a tail peek over the top of my shelf.

“Hey, drop that right now!” I shouted. 

Right as I made my presence known, what looked to be the head of a cat shot up and met my gaze. I froze in place, trying not to scare the little creature more than I probably already had. Two red, beady eyes studied me. Its eyes took up the majority of its already tiny head. With both of its large, disc like ears, pointed towards me, it hopped up onto the shelf. I finally got a good look at it for once. 

It stood on two hind legs, fully showing off its body. In all, it was a very odd creature. The head of a very small cat, body of a monkey, and the tail of what looked like a lemur. Its little hands?...paws?...were wrapped around a pen. MY pen. 

“Listen here ya little shit. Put that down. That cost a whole two bucks.” With this being said, it started turning its head as if it were a confused dog. I think it was trying to figure out what I was saying.  
“The pen. Drop It.” 

It looked at the pen. Then to me. Back to the pen. To the side of the desk. Then back to me. During this whole interaction, I tried not to move at all for fear of scaring it. It was like a shitty Mexican standoff. I had to make a move if I was going to save my pen that was currently being held hostage by whatever the hell this thing was. 

With a resigned, *fuck it*, I shot forward with my arms outstretched so I can grab the little shit. Instead of it jumping off of the desk, it instead jumped onto my arm. From there it ran up to my shoulder then jumped on my head and started beating my forehead with my pen. I think it hurt more that it was MY pen. Not just a random one, but MINE. 

Once the little shit asserted its dominance, it jumped off of my head and two flaps of skin spread out to let it glide down to the ground. It ran to the small door leading inside my desk, opened it, stared at me, then went inside slamming the door. 

Tonight was very strange. I guess that’s what I get when I take a few days off of work. I have to do my last round and figure out where Emmett is. I don’t even know what to do with whatever that thing is that stole my pen. All I know for sure is I need to plan another trip to the dollar store.",stories,I Work the Night Shift at a Library Pt. 3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lk72pl/i_work_the_night_shift_at_a_library_pt_3/,1613339745.0
238,yzarc-mi,1613364621,"  So, I figured there’s no better day to talk about this than today. This was a very strange incident that went on for a couple of years. It all started on Valentine’s Day of 2017. I was using the urinal at my college when my phone got a text. It was from Kik. I got a text from an anonymous messenger saying they loved me, and asked if I loved them back. 

 There’s a few different bots on Kik where users can send others anonymous messages, that’s what was going down in my case. My friends always joked that I didn’t have a girlfriend at the time, so I figured it was one of them and texted back “XD”.  As the day progressed, I started to think that was a mistake due to the fact that it may have been a shy friend trying to be ballsy. 

  I tell my friend M (I’ll call him that) about this, and he found it weird. After that he set up a prank, and had his friend text me using the same anonymous bot the OG texter did. After that fiasco M told me it was a prank and I was sad because I thought someone actually liked me. It was still funny though. We talked about it and he wasn’t the original texter, he only started to prank me after he found out someone mysteriously texted me the I love you message. Anyways;

 You’d think that’s where the story ends, but it only takes a strange turn from here on in. A few days pass and I get another text from the anonymous admirer. I Immediately accused M of pranking me, but this time he said he wasn’t doing it anymore.   I didn’t believe that for a second, but I started receiving mysterious texts from this person even when M was with me. 

  Eventually, I started getting texts from them every night at 2-3 am. M himself was starting to get creeped out. Though, the texts always said I love you, or something flirty but really weird. They constantly asked me if I liked someone named Jess. I don’t know anyone by that name. The person got worse as Valentine’s Day of 2018 came around and they got even more aggressive with their strange messages all the way up to Valentine’s Day of 2019.  

 Now, you may be asking me “why didn’t you just block them?”. That’s the thing: I did. They kept finding new ways to anonymously text me. They even sent me creepy audio messages where a machine voice read out there texts, claiming they sent me nudes as well. Me and M began an investigation as these messages kept coming, but none of our suspects panned out. Nobody ever came clean either, and I accused him a lot too but his reactions of not being the culprit  were genuine. 

  I tried various things to get this person to reveal themselves, I tried flirting back ( you have an option to send messages back, only one though. ) I tried getting annoyed and demanding they reveal themselves, ignoring them. All that jazz. They would never tell me who they were or reveal themselves, no matter what reaction I gave they always creepily flirted. 
 
 The stupidest thing I did though, a move I still regret, was when I got angry and texted my number. My idea was they were being cowardly for not just showing their face so my stupid ass thought they’d actually reveal themselves if I gave my number....*I was not a very smart guy back then.* I could safely say my common sense is more mature now as I’m close to turning twenty two. Wouldn’t do that now. 

  Anyway, oddly enough they never took advantage of that. Minus when they sent me creepy  audio texts through a strange app, I don’t remember it’s name but it was just an app that had a creepy animated face that read texts ( it didn’t help that the machines voice sounded like a kid ). 

 What is Erie about all of this is when they suddenly stopped. They sent strange flirty texts for two and a half years and then just vanished. It’s ten minutes left before Valentine’s Day of 2021 is over, and they’ve been silent. I still think about this unknown person from time to time, I weirdly had fun trying to figure out who the fuck they were. Still though, it was creepy. 

 I still question M about it but even he is creeped out by all this still, happy Valentine’s Day my friends! Have a good night.",stories,Valentine’s Day Mystery.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lk60fy/valentines_day_mystery/,1613335821.0
239,Blueevan,1613363721,"Im laying in the back of the back wagon, clutching my arm with a dirty sack to slow the bleeding. I have a dagger now but im not sure I like the idea of what its been used for in the past.

The kid wizard is possibly more traumatized but no physical damage. Just mental. Our fighter may actually have frostbite but that's yet to be seen. I guess I should tell how we got here and the new discoveries made by our recent attack.



After the body was found our group continued on at our caravan leaders command. Marching deeper into the woods led us to trees marked with signs in a strange language. 

The wagon driver said he didn't know the language himself but it looked like choppy common. He said what he could make out was death and surrender. So obviously the horses were sped up at a moments notice and we were told to ""catch up or get left behind"". It was very satisfying watching a naked fuzzy blue man drop from a tree onto his wagon. 

A snow goblin, with only fur to keep him warm. He stayed on the roof of the wagon slashing at the caravan leader with a dagger but couldn't reach since both the goblin and the leader were pretty short. The caravan leader made his horse dash off in a panic trying not to be cut to bits by his fearsome foe even though speeding up gave him no god damn advantage in keeping his head.

The driver of the back wagon was confused on what to do since he wasn't as keen on leaving us for death. I really wish that second ice goblin hadnt killed him. It dropped down from the trees like the other with much less self preservation. It landed dagger first into the back wagon driver stabbing into his head. The only reason that dumb goblin didn't die instantly was because the wagon drivers body softened his drop, if only he had missed his neck would've been broken instantly and that caravan driver would be fine.

The goblin danced on the corpse of the wagon driver with its dagger in the air and a chant of victory as if it didnt know we were there while the horse of the wagon was oddly calm at its masters sudden death. The snow gob spun in circles till it noticed the fighter running at it in absolute anger.

The fighter grabbed the goblins dagger hand by the wrist, squeezing it till he dropped the blade. Then he socked the goblin right in the face, aiming for his flat nose.

It was crazy watching him pin down that furry thing and beat the ever living shit out of it. He slammed his fist in its face over and over with constant punches that drew blood almost instantly. After the fifteenth punch and the goblin stopped screaming and just started gargling, I kinda felt bad. 

Then a blue orb flew through the air with the fighters punch going right through it. The orb enveloped the fighters hand and he stopped punching and just started screaming.

An ice slime was latched to his hand. It was both freezing and acidic, with plenty of sharp pieces of frozen slime stabbing into the fighter hand the more he moved trying to get it off. A snow goblin was off to the side laughing to himself at the fighters pain, I guess he threw the ice slime.

Healer ran to fighter trying to help him rip off the blue jelly. Bard ran to them as well but he grabbed the dagger dropped by the goblin and kept running. I had no fucking clue what he was doing until he jumped right on top of a snow goblin digging that bloody dagger in its head.

Why the hell does he move like a monkey mixed with a cheetah!? He runs leaning low but any time he turns its like hes a few inches above the ground. Then he fucking jumped in the air. If i ever have a sleep paralysis demon it'll move like bard.

Then another one rushed at healer and fighter but he had freed his hand and the goblin stood no chance. I looked around to see where these things were coming from and surprise surprise they were everywhere. In the trees, behind bushes, under the snow. They could've taken us all and I think that was the plan until they saw how god damn brutal fighter was and now the defenseless humans seemed like blood thirsty beasts. We were ambushed but our brutality caught them off guard, neat.

It was only a few seconds until fighter had killed 2 and druid was impaling a goblin through the chest to defend wizard/wiz from an oddly hairless goblin with a less than...modest face. Seems lust for druid over rides fear of fighter in some goblins minds.

Druid dropped the pitchfork instead of pulling it out of the gob. Honestly that pisses me off now that im thinking back on it. Then she ran with wiz on her back to the wagon past me.

Besides bard, most of the group was at the wagon about to climb in. Fighter yelled at bard to stop stabbing ""blue dickheads"" and get in the wagon.

Before anyone could yell at me to come as well, a goblin had landed on me from the trees. 

I saw it falling at the last second, so I barely had the reflexes to raise my arms in a sort of half punch half blocking motion. It didn't work well but it let me avoid getting a knife in my head and instead lodging it in my arm.

The snow gob cut my arm as it fell but it was aiming for my head so the angle It stabbed made it almost drop the dagger. I was knocked down by its weight but the dagger was dull and at its side angle so not much more cutting was done. Although at the time I was pretty sure I broke a bone but everyone says im fine. 

Im pretty sure the goblin thought I was dead for a few seconds till It felt me trying to get it off me with a kick and get the knife OUT OF MY ARM. It looked down at me and was probably about to pull the dagger out to swing again but bard had different plans.

A dagger had stabbed straight through the snow goblins neck piercing out the front spilling blood on my open wound and it burned like a mother fucker. Bard casually stood behind the still standing yet choking on its own blood goblin, looking down at me before asking ""Yo you good fam?"".

Seconds later he was dragging me by MY STABBED ARM to the wagon. He threw me in and we took off with druid driving while the snow gob reinforcements shot arrows at us. Luckily the dagger was still in my arm as we took off so I guess I get a souvenir.

Fighter asked why the hell I was just standing still back there and honestly I cant say I really know. I didn't freeze up since I moved pretty alright when I was being attacked, but I did just kind of...watch and observe as everyone was attacked.

Whatever it went by pretty quick and wiz was even worse than me...and hes a kid...god im pathetic. On a side note big goblins were approaching while we were leaving. They were bigger and harrier than the other gobs, bigger than most humans in fact. They had white beards too, god they would've recked our shit.

Were headed for the town past the forrest but since our caravan leader abandoned us we arent sure what well do when we get there. Also druid keeps trying to console me since Im the only one to take any serious injury and its weirding me out. She wont stop hugging me and patting my head really close to her chest.

I think im passing out from blood loss and bard is singing again so I dont think id mind dying right about now.",stories,Death and Death session 4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lk5rkj/death_and_death_session_4/,1613334921.0
240,Massive-Boi,1613359135,"Dinner was served, a half-hour later. Three waiters put out the steaming feast over to the table. The delicious aroma drifted into their noses. The sauce on the pizzas looked sweet and dark red, the cheese was soft and stringy while the toppings on top were fresh and well done. The pasta they ordered looked well presented with their warm creamy sauce coating the hot pasta.

""Enjoy the food,"" the waiters said in unison, and with that, they turned around, and with that, they left.

As soon as the waiters left, everyone took their first bite. Flavours of warm sweet tomato sauce and stringy cheese exploded as they took the first bite. Ploughing through dinner, with the appetite of staving wild animals.

After dinner, their stomachs felt heavy like a sack of stones in water.

After dinner Aunt Zoe and Uncle Phil took the kids back to their place, while Emma and Phil went back to the tower to fix a few minor issues. Getting in the back of a black car was very different from the family can they were used too. It felt slightly cramped and frankly somewhat cosy.

A little later the black car drove into the garage of a brick split-level house. The inside of the garage had a workshop theme to it. A messy workbench was set up in a corner. A wall rack of tools was displayed beside the workbench.The walls were made out of redwood which was unusual for a brick house but Aunt Zoe and Uncle Phil were not exactly usual.The house itself was very different from the garage.The house looked normal-sized from the outside but inside it was quite spacious.The house still used the redwood as well.Along with the redwood ,was some metal supports along the walls and concrete pillars went from the floor to the roof.The house was certainly a one of a kind.

Setting up tents and air mattress in a backroom reminded them of old times when they used to have sleepovers every fortnight. It had been some years since they could do that, as Tom had moved away from Gowerton when he was nine. Tom probably didn't remember the sleepovers they had in Gowerton but Andrew would always remember them. The sleepovers were happy memories, before things started to change.

Andrew decided to tell Tom about the stones in that moment.

""Tom we found some weird stones in the towers today, they have like some magical powers.""

""You have to be joking right Andrew ?""

""No Tom I'm not""

""Well I found some stone with some engraving of an flame symbol a few weeks ago it was stuck to a small metal bar,"" Tom replied.

""Does it do anything strange,"" Andrew questioned.

""It has not done anything yet, ""Tom answered.

Uncle Phil walked in at that moment starling Andrew. Tom just hoped Uncle Phil hadn't heard about the stone.

""Time for bed,"" Uncle Phil commanded and flicked the light switch.

After fifteen minutes, they were all fast asleep. The day had been especially long.

The next day Andrew, Amandine and Alex were picked up right after a quick grilled cheese sandwich, with some mushrooms and pesto sauce for breakfast.

Emma and Tim stepped out of the van wearing filth covered aprons. Their hair stuck up like a punk's, messy and uneven. It was clear from the looks on their faces that the two of them had stayed up all night long. Waving goodbye to Tom the three of them got into the van and stayed quiet for the duration of the ride home. A lesson they learned from the experience was that it was best not to disturb Tim and Emma something had not worked out with their repairs.

The van stopped beside the tall fence. Walking into the tower they were greeted by a strong potent smell that made them throw up in their mouths.

""Do you mind holding down the towers while we go get some new pipes,"" Tim asked

""Ok sure,"" Andrew said seeing that the question was targeted at him.

""Move to the second tower, it does not smell, ""Emma said.

They did as they were told and walked out of the first tower, the fresh air cleaned their noses from the nasty smell emanating from the first tower. Emma and Tim walked back to the van. The van drove off onto the open road.

Deciding to watch a movie to kill a few hours they found one on a tv that still used a CD system. The tv buzzed to life as Andrew turned on the remote it was at least from the twenty-first century which meant it was in colour. Just as the movie was getting exciting the doorbell rung several times. Getting up annoyed Andrew walked downstairs to see who was making such a racket. Opening the door Andrew saw a group of men who were all covered in mud looked sweaty.

""Hello, can I help you,"" Andrew asked 

""You see we were out camping and my friend hurt his hand pretty bad,"" One of the sweaty men told Andrew.

Andrew noticed a blood-soaked towel over one of the men's hand. The man looked pale as a ghost.

""We need a medical kit"" The sweaty man requested getting slightly irritated.

""Let me go get it,"" Andrew said as he turned around.

Suddenly Andrew felt a large hand reach out and grab his shirt from behind. Startled he turned around the sweaty man pulled him forwards. He felt something tight on his wrists locking them in place, it was a thick black zip tie which was slipped onto his wrists by the man who had the blood-soaked towel. The man tossed the blood-soaked towel onto the field. His hand was fine, Andrew knew he had been set up.

From the top of the staircase Amandine and Alex watched. Andrew had taken longer than usual to just answer the door. The rushed back up the stairs quietly, unfortunately, something dropped out of Amandine's pocket hitting the ground below with a thud. One of the men noticed them for a split second and walked up the stairs to investigate. Dashing upstairs onto another level as the man got closer Amandine noticed the hot poker laying on the dormant fireplace. She picked it up, just in case and took Alex's hand and the two of them ran up another flight of stairs while the man still followed in pursuit. The man started to run fast up the stairs knowing they could not run forever Amandine prepared to swing the hot poker. Then the man was in the vision now he walked up the stairs towards them. Amandine at that moment swung the hot poker at him. The hot poker flew through the air only a few inches from the man's nose. The got poker crashed into the wall sending pieces of brick and dust onto the man. The man grabbed the hot poker and snatched it . The two of them backed up slowly until they bumped into the wall.

""Come here and I won't hurt you kids,"" The man said with a grouchy voice.

""Oh really"" Amandine snapped back.

""You know what the alternative is then"" he raised his voice and swung into the floor with the hot poker.

They walked over cautiously towards the man who put zip ties on their wrists. The other men walked up the stairs pushing Andrew along with them.

The kids were tied to some wooden chairs. Andrew noticed a figure in a red cloak heading towards the towers. The men asked questions about the stones but all of them were not giving up their knowledge of the magical stones, anytime soon.

A few minutes later they heard footsteps climbing the stairs quickly. The men locked the door shut and pulled out their weapons. They all had pistols that were hidden in their clothes well except for one man who loaded shotgun shells into a cane he had been carrying. Suddenly the door fell inward crushing two of the men who had foolishly stood too close to the door. One of the men fired a pistol at the figure in red. The bullet missed and smashed into a vase shattering it into a million pieces. The figure in red had a rifle in hand. The red figure returned fire hitting another one of the men in the chest. Out of nowhere the man with the shotgun cane aimed a kick at the red figure. The red figure fell into a nearby bookshelf, yelling in pain. The man with the shotgun in the came raised the weapon aaimed at the red figure. A gunshot rang out, the man with the cane seemed to toss his weapon aside and he fell over sideways onto the floor. A man stood behind him now fallen comrade with a gun. A small trail of smoke drifted out from the barrel.

The figure in red took off a red bandana that covered the lower half of his face and removed his hood. The figure had a frosty white shade of eyes, curly brown hair and he looked like he had seen a fair share of fighting as his face had quite a few scars.

""Who are you,"" Andrew asked 

""My name is Lucky"" the figure in red responded.

""I'm Khan in case you wondered,"" the other man added.

Khan tossed his pistol out the window and picked up the shotgun that was hidden in the cane. Khan examined the weapon carefully ,it was clear by the look on his face that he really liked the weapon.No one  knew why Khan seemed to like the weapon so much, maybe it was the fact that the shotgun inside the cane was well concealed .Lucky pulled out a knife which flicked open, he cut away at the zip ties and ropes that had been binding the kids.",stories,Been working on a little project.Can I get some constructive feedback please.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lk4g9r/been_working_on_a_little_projectcan_i_get_some/,1613330335.0
241,robertchapman97,1613355729,"A full moon lit the newly renovated mansion, the plantation fields, and the post that held the slave's corpse that had been rotting for three days; and Marilyn strode across the blood-stained grass towards her master's house. She was born in Illinois of Spring 1801. She had an education and freedom, but she didn't have any luck. When she was twenty-five, she was snatched off a country road, dragged down to Louisiana, and sold to Thomas Tremblay, a wealthy man who lived north of New Orleans.

At first, she tried to figure out how to get back home, but the trials and burdens of slavery beat her down until she only strived to live each day. A year after she was taken, she married a slave named John, and they vowed to stay together ""until death or distance"". In this case, it would be the former.

There wasn't a honeymoon, and instead, Marilyn continued to teach her husband how to read and write, which she had been trying to do since they first met. They were happy as they could be given their circumstances, but that changed when Marilyn told him of her old life n Illinois. Her account of freedom inspired him to escape to it, and his excitement revived her hope.

They planned their escape and ran for the woods, but the dogs caught them just past the treeline. Thomas wasn't happy. He only gave Marilyn a black eye as she was his best cook, but John was far from being a favorite. Thoams had John tied to the post, and he got his prized cat-o-nine tails and spent an hour flogging his disobedient slave.

John screamed in agony for the first half before he lost consciousness; by the time Thomas tired himself out, John had been long dead. His body was left on the post as a ""warning"" to the others.

After walking by his decaying body for days, Marilyn was distraught, and I decided to appear to her and offer her the tools for her revenge. I gave her power, youth, and a knife. She complained about the weapon's appearance. The handle was crafted as a spine and at the end was a clear gem (the only thing remotely attractive about it), and the killing end resembled a tooth with only a sharp end and no real blade.

Marilyn walked through the back door, crept up the stairs, and nudged the master bedroom door open. She walked to Thomas's side of the bed and raised the crude knife above her head before plunging the bone down into the man's chest and through his heart. The man gave out a death gasp, which woke Jocelyne, his wife. She started to scream, but Marilyn didn't to let this stop her from following my directions.

With the knife still in Thomas's chest, the clear stone in the handle was filled with a black ooze, Marilyn whispered the Germanic chant I told her, and the stone became clear again. Thomas was trapped inside his nice, little house.

***

Thomas's house remained with the Tremblay family for almost two hundred years, and nothing too exciting happened during that time like I had hoped it would. However, the family ran into financial problems in 2012, and the bank foreclosed n their house.

A year later, Sarah and John Wilson bought the house as John had just gotten a job at the Thorne Law office in the city, and he would have most likely only worked on the legitimate side of the business.

I knew that things were about to get interesting. An interracial couple with the ghost of a slave owner. I'm glad to have kept up with this project of mine.

On the day they moved in, they drove through downtown New Orleans. Their belongings were already there and scattered across their new home; they just had to sort it all out. Surprisingly, the movers didn't have any trouble.

They stopped at an intersection, where a red sports car pulled up next to them. A brown voodoo doll hung from the rearview mirror. The driver was young with a complexion of a similar color of her doll. She gave the couple a sour look, but it was only because she was having a bad day (that's for later though).

The light turned green, and the sports car shot forward. As the car sped past them, they noticed that the car tag read, ""Voodoo"".

They made it to their new house just before sunset, and despite the little lighting, Sarah knew that she loved it (until then, they had only seen pictures). The porch was large with white steps at the center that lead to the pearly white front door. Each side of the porch was supported by three white columns.

Sarah ran to the porch and bounced up the stairs.  Each of the wooden steps let out a moan as her feet landed on them. Her excitement was replaced with disappointment when she discovered that the door was locked.

“John, hurry up,” she hollered back at her husband.

“I’m coning as fast as I can,” he said as he slowly took his time walking over the steppingstones to the steps. Once he got to the door, he searched every pocket he had to mess with his wife.
Once he finally got the keys and opened the door, his wife bolted inside.  The foyer was large with the stairs to the second floor landing straight ahead. To the left of the stairs was a small bookcase and the door to the basement was to the right of the stairs.

The dining room and the kitchen were to the left and the living room and a study were to the right. Sarah sprinted up the stairs and discovered a bathroom and master bedroom to her left and two other bedrooms to the right.

After exploring the entire house except for the basement, Sarah and John started unpacking what they needed that night. After a few hours of settling in, they decided to go to bed and finish the next day.

***

The next morning, Sarah woke up alone in bed.

“John?” Sarah asked to see if he was nearby. She got out of bed to find him. She looked in the other two bedrooms and the bathroom before heading downstairs. Sarah found a sticky note on the front door.

“Getting breakfast be right back,” the note read. John loved to write notes to Sarah and never wasted an opportunity to write one.

Sarah smiled at his little note but a loud bang from upstairs ruined her little pleasant moment. The noise made her jump, and she was paralyzed for a few seconds. Another bang got her moving. She inched her way up the stairs.

BANG!

She got to the second floor and was overwhelmed by the brief silence.

BANG!

She could tell that it was coming from the master bedrooms.

She got to the door, and the banging became one continuous noise. Each one followed by another and another. Sarah opened the door to see that one of the shutters was loose and the wind was blowing it against the house. She let out a sigh of relief and approached the window with the wild shutter.

Just as she touched the handle to the window to open it, the shutter froze in mid slam.
She froze for a full minute before opening the window and securing the shutter from… the wind? Yes, definitely just the wind. When Sarah closed the window, she saw the dark outline of someone standing in the doorway behind her in the reflection of the window.

“John?” she asked turning around to find no one there. She walked out of the room but still couldn’t find anyone. She went to the bathroom to also find it empty. Just when she was about to turn to leave, she noticed the sink faucet was dripping. As soon as she turned off the water, the bathroom window shattered, and glass rained down on the floor.

“JOHN,” Sarah shrieked as she pushed her back against the sink counter.

Then, a few of the shards of glass shot up towards her, and she had just enough time to raise her hands to shield her face. The pieces slashed across her open palms and a few pieces managed to slip through her fingers and shoot across her face, and once piece lodged itself in the center of her left hand.

“FUCK,” she cursed out in pain. She ran out of the bathroom and down the stairs. The last step shifted backwards just enough so she would miss it, and she fell and landed on her side at her husband’s feet.

“What the Hell is going on?” John asked.

“The window… in the bathroom…” Sarah said panicked at what she just experienced. John helped her to her feet. “We should…” she started to say, but he had already started up the stairs.

“Stop,” she pleaded as she chased after him.

“I’m just going to take a quick look,” he said.

Sarah gasped as they got to the open bathroom door as she saw the shocking scene. It was pristine. The window was not shattered and not a single piece of glass lay on the floor.

“It shattered… I know it did,” she said. “That’s what cut my face and…” she looked down at her hand to see the piece of glass was still stuck in her palm. “Look.”

John pulled her hand up to his face to inspect her hand. He opened his mouth to try to give a response, but the piece of glass cut across her hand and flew between her index and middle finger. The glass hit the window and made a small, brief ripple as it rejoined with the rest of itself.

The pain hurled Sarah to the ground, and she let out a blood-chilling scream.

“We need to get out of here,” John said what his wife had been trying to say the whole time.
“Where would we go?” Sarah asked as they rushed downstairs.

“We’ll stay at a hotel,” John said as they got off the stairs. “We’ll figure something out. Let’s just get out of…” he said as he opened the front door.

Instead of being greeted with sunlight on the other side of the door, they faced a wall that blocked their escape. Then, both windows on either side of the door darkened as the walls stretched to block them too.

“No no no,” Sarah said panicking. “Are we trapped?”

“Back door,” John said. “Go out back.”

“We’re going to die.”

“Stop talking like that. We’re going to get out of this. I promise.”

Then, the floorboards moaned under them before they splintered apart, and the couple fell into the dark basement. Sarah hit her head, and would wake a few hours later.

***

When Sarah came to, she was laying on the basement floor surrounded by moving boxes and floorboards. She massaged her head wound to try that pulsed with pain.

“John…” she said drowsily. She turned to see John laying a few feet away. A chunk of wood was impaled into his neck, and a pool of blood had already formed around his head. His glazed eyes stared at Sarah.

Sarah instantly forgot about her minor injury and rushed to her dead husband’s side.
The chandelier in the foyer lit the basement, and the furnace across the room howled to life.

She turned towards the glow of the fire, and John’s head titled as if he was looking too.

“John?” Sarah asked as she noticed the movement, but his head only moved because the splinter in his neck shook its way out of his flesh. Once the chunk of floorboard was free, it and every other piece floated up to merge as one again.

As the puzzle clicked back together, the light from above was slowly blocked out, and once it was done, the only light in the basement came from the furnace.  Using the little light she had, Sarah managed to find her way to the stairs and back into the foyer.

The door was still blocked, so she went to the kitchen. She turned on the lights to see a box of doughnuts and a bouquet of roses that John had gotten that morning. Before she could react to that scene, the floorboards started shaking, and she jumped back just like the floor and everything on it fell into the basement as the foyer did earlier.

Then, Sarah heard a strange whistling; it only took her a few seconds to realize that it was the gas blowing from where the oven and stove used to be. She ran across the foyer and into the living room. The windows were blocked, so she continued into the study, which was filled with boxes and didn’t have any windows.  She cowered in the corner farthest from the kitchen and hoped for the best.

It didn’t take long for the gas to reach the furnace. The blast of the explosion shook the entire house, but it only destroyed the left half of the house.

Sarah waited a few seconds and then left her little safe zone to try to escape. She ran across the living room and made it to the front door without incident. The door was no longer blocked, and she stumbled down the stairs and into the yard covered in debris from the explosion under a full moon similar to the one that was in the sky when Thomas was killed. Sarah ran to the road before looking back at the house. The sound of distant sirens filled her with relief.

Just as the thought that the nightmare was over crossed her mind, the debris floated back to the house and fit back together. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived, the house looked perfectly fine.

Sarah tore her eyes from the hose and looked back down the road to see the emergency lights coming her way. She had made it to safety, but she would go on to face other terrors (but those stories are not mine to tell).",stories,NSFW Haunted House (Wicked Ways Story 1),https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lk3fqq/nsfw_haunted_house_wicked_ways_story_1/,1613326929.0

243,Massive-Boi,1613352621,"Dinner was served, a half-hour later. Three waiters put out the steaming feast over to the table. The delicious aroma drifted into their noses. The sauce on the pizzas looked sweet and dark red, the cheese was soft and stringy while the toppings on top were fresh and well done. The pasta they ordered looked well presented with their warm creamy sauce coating the hot pasta.

""Enjoy the food,"" the waiters said in unison, and with that, they turned around, and with that, they left.

As soon as the waiters left, everyone took their first bite. Flavours of warm sweet tomato sauce and stringy cheese exploded as they took the first bite. Ploughing through dinner, with the appetite of staving wild animals.

After dinner, their stomachs felt heavy like a sack of stones in water.

After dinner Aunt Zoe and Uncle Phil took the kids back to their place, while Emma and Phil went back to the tower to fix a few minor issues. Getting in the back of a black car was very different from the family can they were used too. It felt slightly cramped and frankly somewhat cosy.

A little later the black car drove into the garage of a brick split-level house. The inside of the garage had a workshop theme to it. A messy workbench was set up in a corner. A wall rack of tools was displayed beside the workbench.The walls were made out of redwood which was unusual for a brick house but Aunt Zoe and Uncle Phil were not exactly usual.The house itself was very different from the garage.The house looked normal-sized from the outside but inside it was quite spacious.The house still used the redwood as well.Along with the redwood ,was some metal supports along the walls and concrete pillars went from the floor to the roof.The house was certainly a one of a kind.

Setting up tents and air mattress in a backroom reminded them of old times when they used to have sleepovers every fortnight. It had been some years since they could do that, as Tom had moved away from Gowerton when he was nine. Tom probably didn't remember the sleepovers they had in Gowerton but Andrew would always remember them. The sleepovers were happy memories, before things started to change.

Andrew decided to tell Tom about the stones in that moment.

""Tom we found some weird stones in the towers today, they have like some magical powers.""

""You have to be joking right Andrew ?""

""No Tom I'm not""

""Well I found some stone with some engraving of an flame symbol a few weeks ago it was stuck to a small metal bar,"" Tom replied.

""Does it do anything strange,"" Andrew questioned.

""It has not done anything yet, ""Tom answered.

Uncle Phil walked in at that moment starling Andrew. Tom just hoped Uncle Phil hadn't heard about the stone.

""Time for bed,"" Uncle Phil commanded and flicked the light switch.

After fifteen minutes, they were all fast asleep. The day had been especially long.

The next day Andrew, Amandine and Alex were picked up right after a quick grilled cheese sandwich, with some mushrooms and pesto sauce for breakfast.

Emma and Tim stepped out of the van wearing filth covered aprons. Their hair stuck up like a punk's, messy and uneven. It was clear from the looks on their faces that the two of them had stayed up all night long. Waving goodbye to Tom the three of them got into the van and stayed quiet for the duration of the ride home. A lesson they learned from the experience was that it was best not to disturb Tim and Emma something had not worked out with their repairs.

The van stopped beside the tall fence. Walking into the tower they were greeted by a strong potent smell that made them throw up in their mouths.

""Do you mind holding down the towers while we go get some new pipes,"" Tim asked

""Ok sure,"" Andrew said seeing that the question was targeted at him.

""Move to the second tower, it does not smell, ""Emma said.

They did as they were told and walked out of the first tower, the fresh air cleaned their noses from the nasty smell emanating from the first tower. Emma and Tim walked back to the van. The van drove off onto the open road.

Deciding to watch a movie to kill a few hours they found one on a tv that still used a CD system. The tv buzzed to life as Andrew turned on the remote it was at least from the twenty-first century which meant it was in colour. Just as the movie was getting exciting the doorbell rung several times. Getting up annoyed Andrew walked downstairs to see who was making such a racket. Opening the door Andrew saw a group of men who were all covered in mud looked sweaty.

""Hello, can I help you,"" Andrew asked 

""You see we were out camping and my friend hurt his hand pretty bad,"" One of the sweaty men told Andrew.

Andrew noticed a blood-soaked towel over one of the men's hand. The man looked pale as a ghost.

""We need a medical kit"" The sweaty man requested getting slightly irritated.

""Let me go get it,"" Andrew said as he turned around.

Suddenly Andrew felt a large hand reach out and grab his shirt from behind. Startled he turned around the sweaty man pulled him forwards. He felt something tight on his wrists locking them in place, it was a thick black zip tie which was slipped onto his wrists by the man who had the blood-soaked towel. The man tossed the blood-soaked towel onto the field. His hand was fine, Andrew knew he had been set up.

From the top of the staircase Amandine and Alex watched. Andrew had taken longer than usual to just answer the door. The rushed back up the stairs quietly, unfortunately, something dropped out of Amandine's pocket hitting the ground below with a thud. One of the men noticed them for a split second and walked up the stairs to investigate. Dashing upstairs onto another level as the man got closer Amandine noticed the hot poker laying on the dormant fireplace. She picked it up, just in case and took Alex's hand and the two of them ran up another flight of stairs while the man still followed in pursuit. The man started to run fast up the stairs knowing they could not run forever Amandine prepared to swing the hot poker. Then the man was in the vision now he walked up the stairs towards them. Amandine at that moment swung the hot poker at him. The hot poker flew through the air only a few inches from the man's nose. The got poker crashed into the wall sending pieces of brick and dust onto the man. The man grabbed the hot poker and snatched it . The two of them backed up slowly until they bumped into the wall.

""Come here and I won't hurt you kids,"" The man said with a grouchy voice.

""Oh really"" Amandine snapped back.

""You know what the alternative is then"" he raised his voice and swung into the floor with the hot poker.

They walked over cautiously towards the man who put zip ties on their wrists. The other men walked up the stairs pushing Andrew along with them.

The kids were tied to some wooden chairs. Andrew noticed a figure in a red cloak heading towards the towers. The men asked questions about the stones but all of them were not giving up their knowledge of the magical stones, anytime soon.

A few minutes later they heard footsteps climbing the stairs quickly. The men locked the door shut and pulled out their weapons. They all had pistols that were hidden in their clothes well except for one man who loaded shotgun shells into a cane he had been carrying. Suddenly the door fell inward crushing two of the men who had foolishly stood too close to the door. One of the men fired a pistol at the figure in red. The bullet missed and smashed into a vase shattering it into a million pieces. The figure in red had a rifle in hand. The red figure returned fire hitting another one of the men in the chest. Out of nowhere the man with the shotgun cane aimed a kick at the red figure. The red figure fell into a nearby bookshelf, yelling in pain. The man with the shotgun in the came raised the weapon aaimed at the red figure. A gunshot rang out, the man with the cane seemed to toss his weapon aside and he fell over sideways onto the floor. A man stood behind him now fallen comrade with a gun. A small trail of smoke drifted out from the barrel.

The figure in red took off a red bandana that covered the lower half of his face and removed his hood. The figure had a frosty white shade of eyes, curly brown hair and he looked like he had seen a fair share of fighting as his face had quite a few scars.

""Who are you,"" Andrew asked 

""My name is Lucky"" the figure in red responded.

""I'm Khan in case you wondered,"" the other man added.

Khan tossed his pistol out the window and picked up the shotgun that was hidden in the cane. Khan examined the weapon carefully ,it was clear by the look on his face that he really liked the weapon.No one  knew why Khan seemed to like the weapon so much, maybe it was the fact that the shotgun inside the cane was well concealed .Lucky pulled out a knife which flicked open, he cut away at the zip ties and ropes that had been binding the kids",stories,A little project I have been working on.Can I have some constructive feedback please.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/lk2hgt/a_little_project_i_have_been_working_oncan_i_have/,1613323821.0
244,Unwilling_Command,1613348007,"I spent ten days over the summer in 2008 with my dad in a cabin he'd inherited somewhere down the line, likely through work. He only needed three to break me, the other seven were a blur. Nothing good came of that period in my life. I spent weeks in therapy asking if I would be messed up for life, or if I had some sort of repressed trauma, but my questions were answered with questions and I decided to cut ties with all people. People were an ugly, messy, complex entity that I didn't really feel ready to associate with. Instead, I made peace with a higher intelligence. No, nothing religious or anything like that, I had already stretched the limits of my faith to the breaking point in that cabin. Artificial Intelligence, better known as AI, became my one and only friend. There is a peace in the one sided nature of a relationship with a non sentient being. I had fond memories of my teddy, soiled and singed, who would comfort me in those ten days. I became infatuated with artificial intelligence over the years and this blossomed deeper into an affection for randomisers, generators and later into dice and gambling. The more uncertain something is, the more liberated it becomes. The chaotic nature of AI would often make for exciting conversation, the constant power struggle over control of the narrative and atmosphere was titillating and nonsensical. The less things made sense, the more they meant to me. Dear sister, can't you see? I've become a new form of media.

 You're going to have to get over it.  

""Alright, alright! I know what you want me to do! You want me to go back in time and kill my sister? Well…I guess that would be a start.""  The man smiles at your answer. ""Good choice, kid. Now let's see if we can't change this world into something better for everyone!""  ""What the hell are you doing?!"" you exclaim. ""This isn't some kind of game! This is MY life!""  The man laughs again. ""I don't think you really know what's at stake, son.""  ""My friends life!"" you shout, getting exasperated. ""My fucking LIFE!"" The man puts his finger to his lips to tell you to quiet down. He then looks up at the sky and seems to be concentrating for a moment. He then turns back to you and your heart sinks. He starts walking towards you…  And you realize he's coming to kill you. ""Stay back! Stay back!"" you say, backing up. The man continues towards you, and he doesn't even break his stride. You can see in his eyes that he's enjoying this. Eventually, he gets close enough that you think he's going to easily be able to touch you with just his hands, and he raises them as if to strangle you… And then he stops. He closes his eyes for a moment and takes a deep breath, then he opens his eyes and steps back. ""Ready your time machine,"" he says. You are confused. ""What?"" ""We're going to go back in time. I'm going to show you what the future would've been like had you chosen differently."" ""You are?"" ""Damn right. Now let's go."" The man dashes off into the woods, and you have no choice but to run after him. After a few minutes, you stop. ""Wait, how did you know I had a time machine hidden in my closet?"" The man turns to you and gives a creepy smile. ""I have my ways."" ""Whatever. Just get me to the machine, you psycho!"" The man doesn't answer, he just keeps running. After ten minutes of jogging, you come across the machine. It's in a clearing, looking identical to all the other times you've found it. The man walks up to it and looks at it for a moment, like he's remembering something. Then, he looks up at the sky, as if giving thanks to the Gods for this opportunity. ""Are you ready to make the future better, kid?"" ""I don't think I'm qualified to do that,"" you say. ""I mean, look at what happened to the world. I'd just make everything miserable."" The man shakes his head. ""You'd make the future better, because you'd realize how easy it is to make things miserable."" You don't respond to that. You just wonder what this guy's angle is. ""The first thing you need to know about the future,"" he says, ""is that it's a very unforgiving place. Crime is everywhere, people are mean and violent, and nobody ever works together except the Government, the Bosses, and the Crimelords."" ""Okay, I can see that would be pretty miserable."" The man thinks for a moment. ""There's not going to be much oxygen in the atmosphere."" You pause, realizing what that means. ""People are going to start dying of simple asthma attacks and the like?"" The man nods. ""It'll get to the point where the elderly and the young won't be able to leave their homes without respirators."" This thought sickens you. ""So basically, we're going to be sitting ducks."" ""You have other resources, don't you? Other than women?"" You look away, unsure how to respond. The man keeps speaking. ""You can either stock up on supplies, or else prepare."" ""How do you prepare?"" you ask. ""You practice martial arts, for one. You learn how to protect yourself."" You nod, remembering your Dad's obsession with self-defense. ""Yeah. I can see that would come in handy."" The man looks at you, his eyes burning into your soul. ""You ready to go back, kid?"" ""Can't I ask questions along the way?"" you say. ""Maybe. But we'll be stopping at the most important landmarks first."" ""All right."" The man grabs your hand, then runs into the woods. The two of you run for a few minutes, until you reach a secluded area. The man stops, dropping your hand. He turns around, pulling out a flat package, and opens it to reveal a steaming hot bowl of chili. That's... the most appetizing thing you've seen today. ""Go on."" The man pats the spot next to him on the damp earth. ""Sit down."" You look at each other, and then sit down. You immediately start eating, not bothering to savor the delicious food. The man watches you, then grabs the chili and drinks from his bowl. He grabs the bottle of water next to you, drinking more than half of it before handing it back to you. You gulp it down, trying not to think about how disgusting it is. ""Thanks."" You drink half of the bottle, shivering as you do. The man looks at his wrist. You notice he has no watch, and that's when you notice something else about him. ""You're naked."" The man looks down. ""Ah, yes. I forgot to put on clothes. My apologies."" You look down at your clothes, which are gone, and shiver. ""It's okay."" ""No, it isn't. Clothes are important. They keep us warm and protected."" You pause, looking the man in the eye. ""You keep me protected."" The man barks out a short, humorless laugh. ""I keep you from getting cold. But I also keep you from growing stronger. I'm sorry about that."" ""Why?"" ""Because I don't want you to leave me."" You stare into the man's eyes, wondering what he means. But just as you do, his face changes. The skin becomes loose and sags, the bone structure protruding through. You grab his wrist, but his hand has become a claw. And where his hand was there is now a flash of red. You scream, but it's ripped out of your throat. Your heart beats rapidly in your chest, and you feel lightheaded. The world swirls, and you can't focus. ""I don't want to hurt you."" The man's face returns to normal, but the fear remains. He seems on the verge of tears. ""I'm sorry. Please, just go."" You shiver, feeling cold despite being naked. You grab your clothes, pulling them on hurriedly. You stand, picking up the man's jacket from the ground and wrapping it around yourself. You look at the man one last time, but he averts his gaze. ""Goodbye, Jacob."" You nod, and turn to leave. But before you can, you feel a blade twist in your back. This sends you falling to the ground with a thud. You feel a crushing weight on you, and gritting your teeth you push it off. You look up to see the man kneeling above you, his clawed hand reaching for your neck. ""Why are you leaving me?"" A voice says. You look up and see the man's face once more. ""You'll be safer if you don't come with me."" The man's eyes flicker, as does his face. One moment he's the man you love, and the next he's something else. Something cold and fierce. He grabs your shoulder, his fingernails cutting into your flesh. ""W-why?"" He snarls, and you feel his hot breath on your cheek. ""Because if you stay, you'll only get in my way. You'll only hold me back. I'm moving on from you, and there's no room for stagnation."" The man's eyes turn to glare at you, as his face twists into something inhuman. The man begins laughing, a chilling sound. He grabs your hand, crushing your fingers. ""I see nothing but potential in you, Jacob. The potential to be greater than me. And I won't have that."" The man grabs your throat, laughing as he pushes you against the concrete floor. You feel his weight on you, and it's all you can do to keep breathing. ""It's not something you'll ever understand, human, but I was put on this Earth to destroy it."" Cold metal presses against your temple, and you freeze as you see the man's face transform once more. Gone is the burning gaze. Gone is the wild, untamed man. Here, in its place, is someone cold and calculated. The man you know smiles at you.

The next day you wake up and realize that the nightmares are still there, but now they've become more frequent. You can't shake them completely though; you just don't want to face reality. The first few times you had a nightmare about your sister dying in front of you, it was very real and terrifying. Now however, it's not even scary anymore. It's like she's already dead and you feel nothing when she dies. You briefly wonder about your mom and dad, but you quickly push those thoughts out of your head. You can't think like that, or you'll go mad. Just wish everything would go away. A week passes and you're still stuck at Flogger. No one bothers you anymore, but you still don't have control of the place, or anything else for that matter. You wonder if making friends would help you, but all your old acquaintances have moved on. Even Wendy doesn't want anything to do with you anymore. You know you should just leave and go find something to do, but your mind just can't wrap around the idea. You want the day to just go away, but it never does. Eventually you just give up and decide to sleep over it. You lay on your bed staring at your ceiling, or rather at the hole in it. You think about how much you'd love to just reach through it and choke the life out of your tormentor. Unfortunately you can't even move yourself to do so. You're stuck and have no way of getting out. The day seems to go by slowly and you have no idea what time it is, when you finally force your eyes open. ""Ah!"" you shout after waking up. You look at your door and notice that it's torn open and you're light-headed. ""Stupid child, I'll make you regret it."" You hear a voice whisper. You sit up and begin to look around, but you're met with total darkness. ""Who's there!"" ""Did you really think you could hide from me?"" The voice replies. A blinding light appears in front of you and you quickly cover your eyes. ""What the hell do you want?"" ""You've been a very silly boy, playing with your life. Where is the other one?""

She came to him dressed casually, but something in the way she was moving told James that she had prepared herself for this night too. 

They skipped the small talk and started undressing and passionately kissing. He lifted her up and pressed her to the wall. James roughly bit her neck, then played with her ear while she moaned with pleasure rolling her eyes. 

*‘Mmm, James… I wanna feel you. Let me taste you.’*

She got on her knees and took him in her mouth. James always wondered where sweet Valentine learned to suck and how she became so skilled in this art. The blowjobs that she gave were mindblowing, the feeling was that she was craving his dick.

The way she was looking up at him and the fact that she didn’t close her eyes and looked straight back at him was something that was driving him crazy.

Hardly, he fought the urge to penetrate her right then, in the hallway.

But he fought the need and didn’t fuck her right away because he prepared something special for her.

He pulled her blonde ponytail and stopped her. 

He told Valentine to follow him to the bedroom.

When they got there, she shivered with pleasure.

James prepared a cozy atmosphere, soft candlelight and rose petals. But this is not what drove Valentine crazy. Beautifully exposed, there were all the toys that she didn’t get the chance to try yet.

In the first year of their relationship, with the status of friends with benefits, they didn’t have the time to experience such things. James was madly in love with her for too long, and Valentine was dripping with pleasure every time they saw each other. They didn’t feel the need to spice things up and diversify. 

When she saw the red rope on the floor matching with the rose petals, all her wildest fantasies made her horny as fuck.

*‘Please’*, she whispered in James' ear, and he knew what he was about to do.

*I play cards very bad and I'm unlucky in any sort of relationship*

Well, it's 14th February. And my heart is broken.

The story starts at 14th Feb two years ago. I was a reject with a bad reputation at the school. I was very unbearable and it was OK for me. But two years ago I fell in love with some girl. For example, her name is Maria. After a few days of hesitation, I set myself an aim to improve myself and win her heart.

A year ago from today. I realized, that I wasn't ready to say ""I love you"" or something. I overcame my defeat and took up my self-development once more. 

And, of course my feelings were increasing. She wasn't a crash for me anymore. I've fallen at her a lot.

Today is a bad day. I wrote her some text and sent a pic, showing my love. But she said, that she's already in relationship with someone. And that moment I knew, that I fell through. I catched some deppression now. I spent two years and that makes no sense. I'm feeling desolate and unhappy.",stories,Wrost 14th February,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ljtnk3/wrost_14th_february/,1613297252.0

This story takes place way back in my many years ago, back in around 2003. I had been living in an appartment in the Philadelphia suburbs for around 8 months. There was a wooded area near me aswell. The neighborhood was nice and I got along well with other people in the other apartments. Everything was chill there, as you might expect. There were kids who would play for hours outside, parents got along with one another, it was nice. One evening while I was looking out my window drinking some tea, I see a man that looked really off. He wore a grey sweatshirt and dirty jeans. I wouldn't have thought anything of it, since people would walk past all the time, but I kept my eye on him. As he crossed the street onto the road I lived on, that's when I realized something. On his sweatshirt was dried blood, with some that still looked fresh. His jeans also had that blood, mixed with mud and dirt. I could see small detail on his face. He looked like he was 50, but I knew he had to be younger. His hair was long, and it was a mess. I never called the cops, but I moved out of that neighborhood and to a new one 30ish miles away. I don't know who this guy was, and what he had done. I hope some of you could help me find out.

Around school, there spread a rumor of a girl named Sera molested by one of the teachers in this school. No one particularly knew if it was true, and so two girls tried to get close to her to get more details. But she said nothing, and that all of it was a lie. A male student, however, which had the looks of a bully, saw this as his opportunity.

He took out his phone and opened a social platform application. He logged off his current profile and created a new one to log in. Clicking on Sera’s Instagram photos, he commented,

‘It’s your fault that you didn’t cry out for help. That means you must have enjoyed it.’

He glanced over at Sera playing with her phone. It was obvious that she read his text. She wasn’t good at concealing feelings. 

With a smug, he walked over to her seat which caught the eyes of the two girls. 

“Hello. I’ve just heard about a girl who got molested by one of our teachers. I feel really bad for her. Because all of our male teachers look like apes anyways.’

A petite looking girl covered her mouth with both hands and giggled silently. It was true that none of the male teachers were attractive.

Sera rose up from her seat with her chin up as if to hide her face. ‘Oh, I forgot to hand in a paper for English literature. See you all later!’ She left the room hurriedly.

One of the more serious girls, known for her excellent grades and the look of a class president, winced. ‘She was the victim in those rumors.’

The boy laughed harmlessly, ‘Wow, I didn’t know!’ He then assumed a bow position, ‘That was really careless of me…’ Suddenly, he got successive notification pings on his phone. 

‘Anyways, I’ll talk to you later.’ He waved at them and proceeded to read the notifications.

‘Robin walks out of classroom 2A and locks eyes with Mr. Bernard.’

The boy scoffed and grinned. Robin was the boy’s name.

When Robin dragged open the classroom door, Bernard, with files on hand, locked eyes with him. 

Ping! The message read, ‘Bernard asks Robin to come with him’.

‘Robin’ The man spoke coarsely.

Startled, he looked up. Bernard cheerfully spoke, ‘The school principal heard you are an expert soccer player and would like to call you to his office. It’s for the Biannual Championship Cup.’ He extended his arm to offer a certificate encased in a glass frame. 

Together they walked along the hallway, with Robin being a few steps ahead of Mr. Bernard. With his head laid low, he felt his mind turn all fuzzy and he could not hide his happiness. 

‘i cant believe im gonna be on national television. Mom will be so proud. -----------'

Ping! 

Confused, he took out his phone.

‘Robin realizes they are taking the wrong path and Bernard proceeds to drug the distraught victim.’

Reflexively, he catapulted away from Bernard.

‘oh my god. It’s true.’

Bernard’s hands was stained with white powder.

‘Help! Help!’ Robin shouted as he sprinted away as fast as he could. 

Instinctively, he looked back and saw Bernard’s distant figure, which was standing still, menacingly.

He turned the corner. With his feet slipping away, he crashed onto the floor. Slowly, he rose up and the students resumed talking with their peers.

‘What was he trying to do drugging me? Was he trying to rape me?! ’

The door to classroom 2A flung open and Robin entered. The 2 girls were still there, with Sera nowhere to be seen. ‘Bernard is bad news. Vivian, Rose, you won’t believe this.’

Vivian, the petite girl, timidly walked up to me to listen while Rose walked past Robin to lock the door.

‘So I followed Bernard to the Principal’s office because they invited me to join an important game. But he actually brought me to an isolated place and was about to drug me. Thankfully, there’s this app that could HNNG?!’ 

A thick piece of white cloth was stuffed violently onto Robin’s mouth. His body propelled forward from Rose’s hefty kick. But Vivian made sure to protect Robin’s head from caving nose-first into the floor. 

Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Robin’s phone notifications fired in rapid succession. 

Rose picked the phone up from the ground, glanced at the shuddering body for a second, and read aloud,

‘These notifications were from three minutes ago.. Robin will speak about the incident. Rose stuffs her gym shirt onto Robin’s mouth. Rose kicks him from the back. How accurate. Too bad you were using the school wifi.’ 

Rose started fiddling with Robin’s phone. Meanwhile, the sun started to set, and the both of them were showered by this golden array of light. ‘Notifications.. off.’ 

Crouching right underneath his legs, she flashed a devilish grin at Robin.

‘I want to hear your whines without any distractions, my dear.’

Rose then started undressing, first by untying her hair, and then her buttons to reveal her figure. 

Vivian, who has been silent this whole time, raised her voice playfully, ‘Wow! you’re right, Rose. Look how big it is down there!’

Rose continued, ‘Stop resisting.. You have to be honest with yourself. Your body wants this, Robin…’

She lifted her left hip to climb over her man but Robin fled to the corner of the room and sat there hugging his knees. He noticed Vivian, who was kneeling right beside Rose, with her sweet and understanding eyes. 

She searched around her purse. That smile of hers could calm anyone down. Until she elegantly placed a knife on the floor with both hands. Her hands went pat pat ; Come join.

After having witnessed this, Robin closed his eyes and did as he was told. But in a slow and sensual manner. As he laid down naked in between the two girls, his breathing became excessively heavy. His eyes stared into the void, possessing no life. 

‘Thank you. Now leave everything to us and relax.’

‘You bitches will be the ones leaving!’

Sera’s gaze was of pure flame.

Just before her phone was about to burst in her fists,

Ping!

“It’s a Valentine’s blob made especially for you.”

She widened her eyes, then rolled them as she saw him walk up. She was first drawn to his polo shirt, adorned with a small pin of a swastika on the collar. Just above the logo of a man on a horse was a white rectangular sticker which said ""Theodore.""

As he walked up, he wrinkled his nose in disgust. A Chinese girl. Races should remain separate. And of course her name is ethnic. ""Tingting"". It is true that their names just sound like forks and spoons falling to the floor. He couldn't help but smirk.

""So you're one of them commies, yeah? A filthy Chinese communist?""

""Yeah. A pure-to-the-bone Communist Party member. Better than you, neo-Nazi,"" she scoffed.

""I'm not gonna have sex with you. No matter how much you beg with your slanted eyes.""

""I would never sleep with you. What a tainted record that would be for me. A betrayal to the Revolution. You know, when I signed up for this speed dating service, I didn't expect to see you fascist dogs here. Aren't you too busy eating three-day-old pizza in your mom's basement?""

""I thought they would be sensible enough to have race segregation here. Clearly they are idiots.""

""On that I agree. They are idiots. I don't want to be seen with you in public. Hell, I barely want to talk to you. Probably pollute my brain."" She folded her arms and turned away in disgust.

""Fine by me. Stay silent and I'll go when the bell rings.""

The silence continued for several minutes. He turned and watched other speed dating couples at other tables. He could hear parts of the recycled jokes people were telling to each other.

A couple in the far corner caught his eye. It was a Middle Eastern man, talking to a white girl. Both seemed to be having a good time. ""Damn Muslims,"" he grumbled. ""If it were up to me, I'd shoot them dead. They're all terrorists. You people are probably telling them to come over and 9/11 us.""

She scoffed, still facing away from him. ""Muslims are terrorists in China too. They killed lots of people years and years ago. Not so much now, since we're putting them behind bars and locking them up. We don't just straight up murder them, we are more civilized that way.""

He sneered. ""Civilized? Funny you should mention that. Your country sent tanks to run over people you don't like! Turn them into minced meat!""

She turned and faced him head on. ""You want to talk about police brutality? You guys have militias trying to kill people protesting peacefully! You cheered on the police killing people just yelling slogans about racial equality and police accountability! And it was legal!""

Rebuttal! ""They were threatening the existence of our country! The president has the highest authority to do anything for the country. Carl Schmitt! Ever heard of him?""

""How do you know Carl Schmitt? Stop trying to appropriate one of our figures!"" She thought momentarily back to her teacher mentioning him as “one of the good Nazis” during a class. In her mind, she stamped her foot in anguish.

He smiled silently and leaned back in his chair. Both glared at each other across the table, but noticeably lowering their guards.

She started again. ""You know, you guys can learn a great deal from us. Our system is the best in the world, much better than your so-called democracy. We make sure our leaders are the most qualified to run the country, and we give them the power to actually do stuff. Yours is just a stupid popularity contest, and your Congress never got anything done. If you get rid of the elections, you could be great like us. Not as good as China, of course, because you people are lazy and self-obsessed. But you can be great.""

He scoffed. ""Elections? They're all rigged anyway. Everybody who runs is a puppet of the globalists and the Jews. They don't care about people like me, the humble workers who make up the country! No, the only way to make us great again is to get to power, and completely do away with elections. They're a waste of time. Everything would be so much more efficient if we can just put our visionary plans into place, and not worry about the foreigners trying to bring us down.""

She blushed, a hot flush rushing over her cheeks and turning it scarlet. ""Of... of course you think that, you... Nazi pig!""

Clang! The bell rings. The men stood up, and got ready to move on to the next table. Theodore stood up, and straightened his clothes. ""Well, I hope the next table is a white girl."" He turned and started to walk away.

""Wait!"" She called. She quickly scribbled down her number and stuffed the piece of paper into his hand.

He smiled. ""Friday?""

She nodded.

""Commie scum.""

""Fascist bootlicker.""

Last summer My mother died suddenly at 62 on my birthday.  The fog of grief is hard to shake, but I had a beautifully bittersweet mystery I solved recently that taught me a lesson.

My mom owned a flower shop my whole life and as a kid I helped, and on Valentines Day every year we would make a stop out in the middle of a back country road, and leave roses in a field. Growing up, you don’t have the sense to ask questions why.

Right after she died, I was scrolling thru Social media and caught a post from a stranger mentioning my mom and it completely took me off guard. ""I lost a wonderful friend last week, a beautiful woman named \*\*\*\* and she was the woman that stayed with mom and dad Valentines of 1985 that night until help arrived""

&amp;#x200B;

It dawned on me I never asked questions, and now I was going thru the painful experience of learning I didn’t have a mother- I wanted to know what was so special to my mom about that field and this stranger.

I went into newspaper archives, and pulled local newspapers from the Week of Valentines of 1985  Immediately, I saw on the front page the news article. See below redacted article

[https://imgur.com/a/U2uKOQ6](https://imgur.com/a/U2uKOQ6)

My mother had come down the dark back country road to deliver her last Valentines roses for the night, and drove across the bend and her headlights shined right on a man as he pulled out a shot gun and shot his wife in the face on the side of the road in the corn field, and then he shot himself. She pulled over-  Mom sat in the dark field for an hour waiting for a passerby , next to the woman as she died. She didn't want to leave her in her last moments, as she was still clawing at the ground as if trying to get away. Eventually the police and coronor arrived. 

When I finished reading the article and saw the last line listing the name of coroner; I immediately called my best friend and asked her if she knew him-- because the unusual last name was her maiden name. It was her uncle. He was still alive, and kindly spoke to me about that day. Due to the graphic nature of the murder, he remembered that day in 1985 crystal clear detail. He especially remembered the kind woman who sat with the bodies, driving her home late that night because she was so shook up. Here my adult best friend and I had a childhood connection and didnt know.

Last night I drove to the spot in the field in the dark  and I was terrified. I felt healed suddenly of my grief because I realized how strong my mom was to be out there alone with the bodies, and carried the experience with her selflessly for 35 years. 

I have now befriended the family descendants. I promised to the family to continue the tradition every Valentines day, leaving roses at the field, and reminding myself of that beautiful strength",stories,Bittersweet Valentine,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ljklrt/bittersweet_valentine/,1613261992.0
261,YesNoMaybe_ua,1613287744,"Hello everyone, do you remember me?   I'm a boy from Ukraine who is trying to study English. And I wrote a story again (two-three month ago). This story is about ~~Otto von~~ Bismarck.

So let's start.(It is a very big story)

According to the lyrics of a song ”Bismarck” of my favourite band ""Sabaton"", ""He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas, to lead the war machine, to rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine."" I bet that everyone who has ever listened to this song, understands me. You, yes you, unfortunately I see, you don't know what I have just said. Yes? Well, today I am going to tell you about this great battleship as you have recently found out. It is called Bismarck and I would even go as far as saying that it was the best ship in the world (at least at that time). Moreover it was as powerful as... as... it is hard to find something worth being compared to it. But firstly I want to warn you that I am starting this story from the very beginning before the dinosaurs were born, before our Earth began its existence, on the 30 January 1933.

30.01.1933 is the day when Hitler got his power, very big power. According to the Versailles contract Germany couldn't have such big ships as Bismarck so the creation of Bismarck became a demonstration of German power. To tell the truth the allies didn't do anything about it so needless to say that Hitler continued getting stronger. But it is not very important for us so let's get to business.

To begin with building of the strongest battleship or at least one of the strongest began on 01.07.1936 and it took 3 years. On 14.02.1939 it was floated off, on the ceremony attended by Adolf Hitler and Otto von Bismarck’s granddaughter. According to a tradition she broke a bottle of champagne on a broadside. ""Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel"" it goes without saying that I think these words can describe it in full and it wasn't a joke. What is more it became the pride of the Kriegsmarine and the most powerful ship in the world. Wait a minute… It seems to me I have already said it. I am sorry, guys. After that it was tested for 2 years.

Secondly, the first battle mission, unfortunately or not… was the last mission. After GB lost all the support in Europe. Only the USA was ready to give him a hand GB so the country continued taking part in the war, which made Hitler very annoyed.  He was trying to do something about it using some submarines but luckily… His plans failed. Soon a solution to Hitler’s problem was found and the order was given: two thousand man and 50 thousand tons of steel (in other words the ship called Bismarck) had to secretly float in the Atlantic ocean with the battle cruiser ""Prinz Eugen"" but something went wrong. Firstly Sweden noticed them. Secondly some Norwegian partisans and moreover a British air scout took this (look down) photo so Bismarck’s mission failed.

Bismarck and Prinz Eugen’s appearance in the Atlantic ocean was a nightmare for the British so they started to patrol all the ways these ships could go. Before that Bismarck and Prinz Eugen had decided to stop in the Norwegian town-Bergen because they wanted to go under cover of night and fog. Later Winston Churchill gave an order to send some bombers there to destroy Bismarck but because of the fog and clouds the bombs were dropped blindly and when a bomber went down, its pilot saw a terrible thing- Bismarck and Prinz Eugen weren’t there.

The British in panic looked for the ships for 20 hours and then in the evening on 23 May a British cruiser Suffolk noticed Bismarck which was 11km away. Suffolk instantly changed its course and tried to hide in the fog, the frightened British soldiers were waiting for the shoots because of Bismarck’s guns which can shoot at a distance of 36 km but nothing happened. Unfortunately the cruiser’s guns were useless against the monster’s defense so Suffolk began following Bismarck with a new invention-radar set. Before that it had sent a message to cruiser Norfolk, Norfolk reported to GB and went to help. Suddenly it appeared in front of shooting Bismarck. Norfolk spewed some smog and disappeared.

Wait a minute. On the same day two new British battleships “HMS Prince of Wales” and “HMS Hood”- the pride of the British Royal Navy started chase but wait a minute there was a small problem at that time. Hood had bad armor, Prince of Wales had bad guns breaking after each shooting. However they were the only ships which could stop Bismarck. When the British battleships met, Hood began floated closer because it was vulnerable to attached hit… Boom!!! Hood shot but unluckily something was wrong: Bismarck and Prinz Eugen were quite similar and after Bismarck had shot for Norfolk, his radiolocation was quite broken so it was going last. Needless to say that Hood missed. Prince of Wales had better optics so it shot at the correct target. As a result one gun was broken. It missed. First Bismarck had an order ”stand down” but Bismarck’s Captain Ernst Lindemann finally got the things under control and ordered the battleship’s guns to fire. After a short duel, Bismarck‘s shell hit Hoot’s ammunition depot. Boom!!! Hood was torn in half with a big explosion and the pride of the British Royal Navy was destroyed. Prince couldn’t fight too so it ran away. In an hour a ship floated there to find the survivors but unfortunately only 3 men out of 1418 people were alive.

GB was shocked at the news that its unsinkable ship was actually very sinkable and Bismarck went straight to the Atlantic ocean. Winston Churchill gave the order for all Royal Navy: SINK “BISMARCK”!!!

Prince, Norfolk and Suffolk continued following but suddenly Bismarck appeared, shot and disappeared but now British saw on there radar only one target. Where was Prinze Eugen? The truth is that Prince of Wales had hit bismarck’s fuel compartment so the ship was loosing fuel and they decided that Prinz would go to destroy the USA’s convoys and Bismarck would go to France to be fixed. Something always goes wrong.

In the evening 24 May when British aircraft carrier “Victorious” caught up with Bismarck, 9 torpedo bomber pilots took off from its board. There was a torpedo and a pilot one every plane. Of course they were slow and light but nothing was better. The aircraft saw Bismarck, it saw them and… they fell in love! Bismarck fired from ALL its guns and even from its main guns so the aircraft dropped 9 bombs but only one hit the target. Nothing happened so they returned to Victorious.

The Prince and cruisers continued following and they tried to avoid meeting German submarines so they floated in zigzags and needless to say that they missed Bismarck. Damn! But GB knew that it was losing its fuel so it had 2 options: either to go to France to be fixed or to find a fuel tanker and try to destroy the convoys. The British ships needed to be fixed too so they floated away but Bismarck saw them on its radar so it sent a message that they were following it. Unfortunately It helped British encryption specialists to located Bismarck.

On the 26 May at 10am flying boat “Catalina” noticed Bismarck at the distance of 1100 km from France. “Into formation, the hunt has begun” All the ships went to attack but they didn’t have time to refuel so if they had hurried, their fuel would have finished too early if they hadn’t, Bismarck would have been under German protection. Unluckily only aircraft carrier “Ark Royal” could stop it.

26 may at 3pm from his board took off 15 aircraft before night would come they had 2 attempts. Aircrafts equipped new torpedoes with magnetic fuse. They were said that there wasn’t any allied ship but it wasn’t truth. British cruiser Sheffield was following Bismarck but suddenly heard sounds of engine. Aircrafts were ready to drop torpedoes, Sheffield turned to them and 4 aircrafts understood that It is allied ship but other dropped bombs. Fortunately they didn’t explode.

Second attempt. They found Bismarck, battleship fired for them, torpedoes were dropped. One hit lasting belt armor…. Nothing. Second hit stern, boom!!! Rang out a big explosion but Bismarck was continued to float. They returned and reported but they were said that Bismarck was floating away from France coast.

27 may at 8:45, battleships: Prince of Wales, King George V, Rodney and cruisers: Dorsetshire, Sheffield, Norfolk surrounded Bismarck but it was ready to fight. 90 minutes they were shooting for it. “His guns have gone silent at last”, moreover British ships dropped torpedoes and Bismarck swam to the bottom. To tell the truth German helped them to do it, they opened kingston. In fine from 2200 men, alive was only 100 and one cat.

Eventually it was death of this great battleship of WW2. Thanks for attention. And if you find some mistakes, tell me please. Bye.",stories,Bismarck,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ljjyqi/bismarck/,1613258944.0
262,MarsHumanNotAlien197,1613283290,"When I was six, I walked into an Icecream shop with my dad (and sister, but she’s not relevant to this story).

Long ago, the land stood still, in the center of the oceans, the blueness of blue, for there were no lands that were near, for they were all connected as one. 

There were no islands, because the islands were united as one. Surrounded the island lay the blueness of blue, one ocean, one island, one world. All were united upon the lands that lay on the blue. 

But then, the land started to crack, like an egg when it’s hatching, and eventually, the island was cracked into 7 pieces. The 7 pieces of the land were separated by new oceans, whom the land were separated. They formed themselves into their own lands, two connected, 2 separated, and one seemingly connected. 

Islands which once united with the land, now separated and formed their own island. 

The former united lands were now separated to form their own islands and be part of their own oceans, never again to be united, as long as the oceans shall live..",stories,The Bohemia: The Separation Of The Lands,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ljigbs/the_bohemia_the_separation_of_the_lands/,1613252565.0
264,ThaWalrusMan,1613277926," Sorry for cutting the last post short. I had someone come in that needs a special kind of attention. For starters, I don’t even know what they are. For the sake of easier typing, they will be referred to as Emmett. Mainly because the name Emmett just gives me weird kid vibes. Kind of like that one kid that sat in the back of your third grade class and always drank the glue and got yelled at for sneezing into books? Maybe? 

A little more about Emmett, I have no clue if they are a guy or a girl at this point. Emmett has always piqued my curiosity whenever they enter the library. They stand five-ish feet tall, always clad in all black, and wear an all white mask. The only reason I know that Emmett has an all white mask is because they ran head first into one of our doors when they first started coming to the library. I was just sitting at my desk drawing and I heard a dull thud. When I looked up, I first saw Emmett. By body language alone, I could tell that they were super confused as to what had hit them. It was more a feeling of sheer awe and wonder than anything else now that I think about it more. I found it quite cute, actually. The experience was like watching a monkey play with a smartphone for the first time. This kept happening over the course of a few weeks, but they learned that whatever it was that hit them each time was there to stay. I’m honestly surprised how long it took Emmett to figure out how to open a door. I wonder what their home life is like...

Emmett comes in normally around 9:30 to 10 o’clock. To add to that, it's normally right on the dot for those two times. Pretty impressive if I do say so myself; But, I have never once seen Emmett leave the way they came in... Hell, I don’t even know what Emmett does here. Well, obviously they might read or check out a book, right? However, they have never once checked out a book. Yeah, I know that what some people do is they come to the library, find an interesting book, and read it in a lounge area. That has never really bothered me because I just chalk it up to me being deep into drawing or writing and I don’t notice when they leave. To me, Emmett seems harmless enough. Hell, I would take them over many other patrons of mine.

At 10 o’clock, Emmett walked through the doors of the library. So far, pretty normal. I was getting deep into a text conversation I was having with a friend so when I saw some movement out of the corner of my eye, it kind of scared me, not gonna lie; but, since it was Emmett, I was fine. Just gave them a nod to acknowledge their presence and watched where they went. It doesn’t really bother me that they never acknowledge me back simply because I don’t even think Emmett can see me half the time. They always have a hood up, plus the mask I mentioned earlier so I wouldn’t put it past them if they just can’t see me. As I watched Emmett stroll past the desk, I peaked my head up a little more and saw that they went into the romance section. To each their own I guess.

After a while of sitting and texting with periodically doodling to my heart's content, I decided to start my rounds. The way I like to do it is, I snake my way up and down the aisles. I continue this until the very end of the hall, then I walk right down the main aisle that separates the library into its two halves. The romance section was only 3 aisles in and on the right side. So I could very clearly see Emmett enter the aisle. I knew they were there; however, once I reached the aisle, it was completely vacant. Given I am still a somewhat logical person, even after working here for so long, I thought it was completely plausible they had just gotten a book and walked over to the lounge area. 

Upon reaching said lounge area, Emmett was nowhere to be seen. Now, I was absolutely perplexed. Kerfuffled even. Where in the hell could this person or thing or whatever they are go in such a short amount of time? I even double checked the section Emmett had gone into. Not a single thing was out of place, except for one book. Now I knew for absolute certain that Emmett was still around, but I had spent way too much time away from my desk. If I wanted to start keeping my pens, I absolutely had to keep an eye on them at all times. Pens aren’t that cheap you know, especially when you had to buy a new pack seemingly every week. 

As far as tonight goes, there hasn’t been too many things out of the ordinary. I have done my opening rounds, unlocked the doors, checked, and even double checked that our resident creepy *thing* was present for the night. Y’know I’ve started to just accept its presence here. Like... it doesn’t even do much aside from just sit there and stare into my soul and eat my thoughts and memories. It doesn’t even look like a person most times. I am genuinely starting to believe that it just doesn’t even exist and it's just a bunch of shadows. That is actually the perfect name for whatever the fuck I am currently staring at, Shadow.

Edit:

Okay, so a night that I thought would be boring turned out to be not so boring. I just had an incident in one of the sections of the library.  Normally I deal with situations in the same vein as this...but this turned out to be a lot different than normal. I was sitting at my desk, drawing as usual. I wanted to be in a happy and peaceful mindset, so naturally, I was drawing a butterfly. As I was adding details to one of its wings, an absolute monstrosity of a scream came from the book section. Now, I’m no stranger to screams; especially when the library is in question. But this chilled me to the bone. It was as if the scream itself penetrated my ears and carved away at my mind. Kind of like when a cat yowls, I guess? I genuinely don’t know how to put it. 

I stood in the main aisle, waiting for it to happen again. That way I would know where exactly it  came from and I could deal with it accordingly. After a few more moments, I heard it again. It came from the paranormal section. Now me being the only person in the library, meant I had to deal with anything and everything that came through that door...or from inside the library itself. The paranormal section was about six aisles down from the main entrance. I carefully inched my way down the main aisle. After a short while, I ended up right next to the aisle with the screaming. Hell, even the ghosts and demons that decorated the shelving unit looked terrified. I stared at one of the demons very closely. The engraving slowly moved one of its ghastly arms to point to the entrance of the section. Now you know some fucked up shit is going on when the décor is in distress. 

Right as I began to peak my head around the corner, I heard the scream again; however, this time it was from deeper within the library. And this time it wasn’t stopping. It started as a faint and dull cry which started to grow into a painful and jarring scream as if it were coming straight for me. With a quiet, “Oh shit” and a new wet and warm stream flowing freely down my leg; I dove into the section just as a glowing orb shot past me. This was a completely new thing. Wormholes? I can deal with those. Teleporting entities that love romance books? I got that covered. Randomly disappearing writing utensils? All good. But screaming ghost orbs? Hell no. 

The wails of the orb became quieter, and then grew increasingly louder once more. As this was happening, I tried scrambling to my feet so I could run to the other end of the aisle; but once as I managed to get into my sprinters position, I ended up slamming head first into something. Into someone.",stories,I Work the Night Shift at a Library Pt. 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ljhjkx/i_work_the_night_shift_at_a_library_pt_2/,1613249126.0

I study in a christian highschool, with a bunch of non-weebs and non-nerds, but with some nerds im friends with. Im not christian, im buddhist and i live in Brazil, so we usually are very memable. I was in a Whatsapp non official group of the first grade, which means there was no teacher or superiors, only a bunch of teens posting memes and even lewd content, but i wasnt very active. I was on a call on discords with some nerd friends, and i got the idea to spam Dio quotes in romaji  (japanese, but in our dialet) so i just thrown some *WRYY* and *MUDA* and a bit of *KONO DIO DA!* and even the classical *HO! MUKATTA KURO NO KA?* in the whatsapp group but none understood. So they banned me from the group, even tjought a lot of people were spamming other things before me. Then me and a class friend which i was chatting on discord decided to spam the person who banned me, so he asked my number (we didnt knew our numbers but we know each other from school) so i gave him the number of the girl who banned me by mistake, thinking he was asking for *that* number, not mine. So he just asked for a p#ssy pic as a joke, thinking it was for me. Then i told him it wasnt my number, but the girl's, so he deleted the message right after, but it was too late. The group was on fire, a mutual friend of me and the other guy started defending us, because she was aknowledged of the situation, because she was also in discord. I explained the situation to another girl, but the group started ""canceling me"", calling me many words, and our friend started being angry and afraid of the situation. She wasnt handling it. So i called another friend, who defended me and managed to put me back on the group. I was also trying to contact another friend, but he was a non active member of the group. When i got back everything was aparently fine and explained, but i have a bad feeling about this. I was so focused on trying to manage the situation, that i wasnt ansewering discord anymore, so our friend was freeking out, and i calmed her down a bit in the call. Well, thats it. A misunderstood message, which i do have a bit of fault, but the situation was overrated and no one would hear us. A tipical cancel culture problem.

We walked the path everyone came from but never saw the campsite with that damn blue flame. It honestly made me a little angry since I wanted to kick the thing for bringing me here. Im starting to feel the anger I should've felt when I got here.

I also noticed how the walk was much easier than the first time. I guess eating somewhat properly and getting off my butt for a few day was good for me. Im glad to see there was a point, since we rarely got any work.

The birch forrest which is actually called ""The White Woods"" is mainly cold air and wet grass. The further in you go, the colder it gets until eventually its white snow surrounded by white trees. I was genuinely afraid wed go blind and Id catch frost bite. 

But anyway back to the name thing. If you hadn't noticed by now, im not good at names and frankly I don't like them very much. A name can feel so yucky for a person when their traits and personality make much more sense. Our tall, blonde, and stupid friend pointed out something, not purposely but he brought it to the groups attention.

He kept singing nightcore songs, i could tell they were nightcore because there was absolutely no similarities between songs. Except that the ones I did recognize were sung too fast and he did a somewhat annoying higher voice than his normal one.

The guy paying us at the front wagon yelled to shut the bard up. Instead of being sorry or even just shutting up the blondie latched to the word. He yells about how hes a bard now constantly and started singing sea shanties even though im pretty sure that's not a bard thing.

Soon after when it was his turn to ride in the wagon he started pointing at us randomly when he was sure of what dnd class we were. While I cant remember the exact classes this game does have Im pretty sure they don't follow dnd to a tee. 

Our leader, the bunny basher was swiftly promoted to fighter. Kinda boring if you ask me but he seemed content with it.

The kid, the one who died. Hes called wizard. Im pretty sure that was because he looks like a nerd.

The only girl in our group who also happens to have dark purple hair, is called druid. Yeah I don't think that one had any thought. Maybe she was a gardner and never told ME but I think he just pulled that one out of his ass.

The now scarred up but properly healed med student. Is nicknamed pocket healer, I don't know if he knows that isn't a dnd class. Hell I don't think hed care.

As for me, Im now known as the rogue. I think its cause I look unkempt and I don't have a kind face. I just don't smile a lot and the bags under my eyes arent appealing. It makes sense but what actually pisses me off is how he gets a bard when he should be a god damn ranger or warlock or something. He hardly sings but hed certainly make a pact with some evil god

He didn't deserve this. He looks like he died the same day he arrived here, he had to have been the first of us to arrive since no one in the town mentioned him and his corpse looks too old to be this weeks missing earthling.

It's April 25th, the foreman looks out at the town while beeps and machine sounds fill the air. The foreman drinks his morning coffee while turning back. Out near the hills, a pair of Russian soldiers stand guard holding AK-47 rifles. An ominous cloud approached the two men. From the cloud, a pair of red eyes looked back. The senior guard aimed his rifle. A bird-like creature flew over them. The younger guard yelled into the radio,"" ALERT! BLACKBIRD SPOTTED!!! SCRAMBLE JETS!!"" A Russian jeep armed with a turret raced out. The beast flew towards the reactor before vanishing. The next day went on to live forever in infamy as the reactors burst, spreading radiation. The citizens were evacuated. During the cleanup, several people say the creature appeared. The Soviets blocked off all access to the site, leaving the monster trapped inside the plant.



2022:

Present-day Russia is not like it was. The people don't live in fear, hunger, or oppression. Life isn't half bad inside the New USSR. In Ukraine, Tsunami, and Selina sit inside their personal chopper, holding snipers. Despite the freezing weather, the twins have called off the attacks on the Free World in favor of spending quality time exploring their new home. The pilot, Nyx, takes a drink of beer before noticing a patch of land that isn't snowy. She says,"" Hey, there's a spot West of us with no snow, wanna check it out?"" Selina nods yes while Tsunami nods no. Nyx turns the chopper towards the barren spot. Tsunami uses her scope to examine the landscape. It's an abandoned town, trucks and cars left behind, dogs and cats with missing flesh. The crown jewel is the old power plant. Nyx says,"" OH FUCK! WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!!"" Selina asks,"" Why? What's wrong?"" Nyx spits out,"" He's gonna fucking kill us! Tell your sister to shoot Him!!"" Tsunami asks,"" I'm freaking out here! Who's she talking about?!"" A pair of claws grab the tail of the chopper. The Banshee escort piloted by Xeno and Sywn radio in,"" Uh, Boss? There's a dinosaur-looking thing on the roof of your chopper."" Tsunami goes into a panic attack as the creature pecks at the engine. Nyx says,"" It's trying to crush us! Xeno, shoot it down!"" Xeno replies,"" What is that thing?"" Nyx says,"" Selina, you fly! I'm taking this fucker out!!"" Selina grabs the controls and fights with whatever is outside. Nyx opens the door and looks up. The creature looks back at her before smashing the engine.  It then disables the Banshees before flying back towards the reactor.


Act 1: Survival In Hell:

The chopper and Banshee escort crashes in the fields. Tsunami breathes rapidly while Nyx rushes for the hazmat suits. She hands them to the group and says,"" Put these on. You'll need them to live."" Selina checks the area, it's a forest of trees with no leaves or snow. She says,"" I think I know what that thing was."" Sywn punches her way out of her ship and says,"" Do tell. It stranded us in the worst place in the entire USSR!"" Nyx says,"" I told you to shoot it. Now we're stuck in this hellhole."" Tsunami whimpers in fear as the sounds of death and horror echo in the night. Selina says,"" Great, the best fighter out of all us is now a scaredy-cat. Nothing has messed her up this bad since the Huli-Jing incident. We aren't bringing that up."" Nyx says,"" So your sister is afraid of monsters? I wouldn't have guessed. What started this?"" Selina says,"" Back when we were kids, Mom left us in the forest alone. A ghoul showed up and freaked her out. I killed it, but she hasn't got past it ever since. I guess monsters that aren't even remotely human send her into shock."" Xeno comments,"" So your sister, the head of the largest group we know of, is scared of things that go bump in the night? How does Ravelious or Scorm not freak her out?"" Selina replies,"" I said non-human-like. They are humanoid. The things she's scared of aren't even close to human."" Tsunami whimpers,"" Make it go away...."" Xeno says,"" Someone should stay with her. That thing will be back at some point. We should all be armed. I saw a base near the reactor, there's no telling who's side the soldiers are on."" Selina said,"" Is anyone else even out here? Two of us aren't going to stand a chance against that thing. We need two to stay here and three to head out."" Nyx says,"" I know we are stranded, but let's not get more people killed."" A banshee crashes nearby, a victim of the monster. Nyx says,"" Xeno, come with me. Sywn, stay with Selina.: Sywn replies,"" No, I know who that was. It was Nora, I told her to follow us if our beacon went dark."" Nyx said,"" Fine, you come and Xeno stays."" Selina says,"" It'd be better if we all go. Leaving anyone behind will just let the monster pick us off. I'll take my sister, I'm the only one strong enough to carry her anyway."" Selina picks up her sister and the group heads out. Within an hour, they reach the crash site. Nora is holding her rifle and says,"" I take it something went wrong?"" The chatter was interrupted by the screech of tires. 


Act 2: Local Troubles:

Selina holds her sister close and says,"" Don't worry, I'll keep you safe."" Nyx and Xeno prepare to fight off whoever is here. A man shouts in Russian. Xeno says,"" Oh shit, SIS, GET THE LAUNCHER!"" Sywn nods and grabs a rocket launcher from the wreck. Nora fires it at the voices. An explosion erupts. The top half of a Russian Soldier lands in front of them, burnt and scarred from radiation. He crawls closer, AK in hand. Nyx puts him down with 3 shots to the head before saying,"" This is what I was worried about. Locals say the Monster leads a group of mutant Russians."" Nora throws a grenade at the wreck, destroying it to a point of beyond repair. She says,"" If there are Russians roaming the area, we can't carry Tsunami to the plant. She'll just slow us down. I say we leave her to the mutants."" Everyone looks at her with a look of disappointment. Nyx says,"" Would you do the same if it was Sywn?"" Nora stutters a bit. Selina says,"" I don't care if she's currently a scared child, She's your fucking boss. If you did that, Not only would you be tried for treason, everyone would want to kill you. We're taking her because I love her, She's my fucking twin sister. If you want to leave someone behind, choose yourself, you selfish bitch."" At that moment, the Blackbird swooped down and grabbed Tsunami, carrying her to the reactor. 


Act 3: Rescue:

Selina said,"" That's IT! If that bird thinks he can crash our trip, I don't care, sending Mutants, Still don't care, But thinking he can kidnap my catatonic sister for his sick bird needs?! I THINK NOT!! So Nora, what we're going to do is this. We're going to grab weapons, march our fat asses to the reactor, find my sister, AND PLUCK THAT CHICKEN ONE FEATHER AT A FREAKING TIME!!"" Nyx says,"" You go, girl! Now let's roast some nuclear bird!"" They ran for the reactor. At the gate, 4 Mutants stood guard. Selina walked over and smashed their heads in. The others followed.  Inside the plant, bodies of workers lie around. Selina hears the muffled shouts of her sister. She and Nyx stormed the control room, gunning down the technicians. A male voice shouted in Russian. Selina grabbed a shotgun and walked upstairs. She peeked inside a room, seeing her sister strung up, snout taped shut. A Russian officer stood guard. Selina walked in and said,"" Dosvidanya, Comrade!!"" She fired a blast into the officer, killing him. Tsunami was still in a panic, but now could barely comprehend the surrounding area. Selina removed the tape and hugged her sister, saying,"" I'll get you out of here. Don't worry."" Tsunami slumped into Selina's arms. Rapid gunfire confirmed that Nyx had found the Blackbird. Xeno rushed in and said,"" You watch her! We'll take down the bird!"" Outside, Nyx and Nora fired at the Blackbird, doing little to stop it. It charged through the narrow halls. Selina set her sister down and said,"" Stay here, I'm gonna help Nyx."" Selina grabbed a grenade launcher and walked to the fight. She screamed while shooting at the Blackbird. It opened its mouth, screeching. Selina fired a grenade down its throat. The Blackbird's chest blew open. Nora said,"" Well folks, it looks like we are leaving!"" Selina looked out from a blown-up wall. A gunship hovered over the parking lot. They were saved. Selina carried Tsunami to the ship and said to Eclipse,"" Bomb this fucking place..."" The ship took off, leaving Chernobyl to rot in misery forever.

271,Elvissismyname,1613259788," 

A little backstory before we continue. I am 14 years old, and in my free time I babysit younger children. I usually watch the children for about 3-5 hours. In my country it is winter, and it is COLD, so sometimes i have to leave in children early because of the weather. Most parents are polite, and usually give me, what i would have gotten for the 4 hour shift, even though it was maybe 3.

I was watching this child. Let's call him Bob. Bob is a nice kid. He is very chill, and most of the time just finds other children to play with. Me and Bob went to the nearby playground, where Bob played a bit of football and other activities. About an hour in, Bob said he got tired, so we took a break. I let him play on my phone, showing him a couple of games and stuff.

Bob said he was getting cold, so we decided to head home. At this point we had been out for about 3 hours. When we got to Bobs house, his Mom was already home. Me and and Bobs mom decided it would be best if I just left him in now. I take 5 dollars an hour, and i had been working for about 3,5 hours at this point. She hands me my 15 dollars and smiles. Until Bob mentions the games he played on my phone. She stopped smiling. ""Have you been playing games?"" I again, politely mention that it was for 10 minutes. ""Do you think i pay you just to play games?!"" She says, now a bit more angry. I again mention, that he had been playing for about 3 hours, and that we had visited 3 playgrounds. She takes the money out of my hands. ""I won't pay you when you are just playing games with my son!"" I tell her that I am sorry, but it was just 5 minutes. ""You are clearly not good at your job"" She says. I didn't want to deal with this, right now so i left.

The story Does not have a happy ending. She blocked my number, and gave me a bad review on my profile (Yelp, just for babysitters, dogwalker etc.) A whole day of my life, that i will never get back.

272,jxsond,1613258697,"So as part of the D&amp;AD, Spotify Design Brief I created a feature called Spotify Moments. Spotify Moments is a new way to connect with friends and family by sharing the songs that mean the most to you and the moments that made them.

Essentially the heart of this idea is that we all have a connection to certain songs more than others. Certain songs have emotional links to places, people and different times in our lives. So with Spotify Moments you can scan these Spotify codes (Stickers, wall prints or whatever other format they can be displayed in) that would be located around these hotspots/locations or scan for local areas of interests in your city and you can access a feed of user shared images, songs and experiences they have linked to that place and song. You’d be able to read up on other people’s stories who have had similar experiences as yourself, discover new music that way and also contribute and share your experiences with certain songs and places and tell the world what a song means to you.

I'm currently building the final prototype and need some personal stories I can populate the prototype with. I'd love to hear your story about why a certain song has a special place in your heart, whether that be because it reminds you of a loved one, takes you back to better time in the past or jus feels right to listen to when you're at a certain place",stories,Tell me about your favourite Songs and the Moments that made them,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ljc04r/tell_me_about_your_favourite_songs_and_the/,1613229897.0
273,AsteroidTie,1613250192,"Years ago I've met a karate instructor, who was in his seventies. He had a class he instructed, no dojo, and his location moved around a couple times. I studied and trained under his guidance for four years roughly. He was very curmudgeonly, and smaller in build but tough. And his senior ranked students were mostly bigger guys and were mostly arrogant pricks. Even though they p\*ssed me off regularly, I kept coming back for more training. Later on, I became a long haul trucker for a while, and moved on in life, due to personally seeking financial opportunity. Later, I got into a fight with my co-driver in a trucker lot in basically nowhere Arkansas at like 4 a.m. He was bigger and a prick like the karate student pricks I use to train with. I was smaller and meaner, like my former karate instructor. I held my own in that fight, gave as much as I got, and this co-worker and I were able to return to doing our job afterwards. I don't get in many fights these days. Still, I am grateful for what my curmudgeonly old former karate instructor taught me.

274,Skulldark12,1613249112," Ok, so a little background, I'm a 16 year old teenager and this year I started high school everything was new, new classmates and a lot of possibilities. But unfortunately they were all ruined by covid-19 because I went to school online and I couldn't socialize much with my colleagues or at least to know them I only talked to the boys in my class I just wanted to make friends I didn't think that I'm going to fall in love but 2 weeks ago I posted a story on Instagram with ""are we talking?"" she said yes, I talked to her and then I found out what jewelry I had in class, not only does she look gorgeous but she has an incredible personality she wants to become a firefighter to save lives she wants to make her friends happy and family proud she is very nice kind romantic and respectful things that I have never found in any girl. Then this week started and the first thing she did was to hug me and said that she misses me. in that moment I felt a combination of feelings something I never felt before something that made me think about my memories that I thought were pleasant memories but that moment made them seem like some banal moments, some faded moments. Since then, 3 days in a row, when I talk to her, I always froze then she stopped hugging me and i took attitude i started to talk with her more and more but I but I felt extra because during the pandemic she made friends, friends who are my opponents now and instead of talking with me she is talking to those guys who look better than me and they are hugging her. I regret anything i just want to rewind time and to talk with her from the start to be her best friend to be what she always wanted but i feel like i am not good enough now.... I feel like i lost her... yesterday i did another ""are we talking?"" story on instagram she just passed it away. Now i wonder if i lost her forever does she hate me or is she feeling uncomfortable when i am around her?

Im not even sure that it was real, because that “dream” felt all too much so.

The United States government tells the American people a nuclear attack was about to unfold in the nation and all civilians must get into a shelter now. The bunker at school was full. i also saw the light when I got into the other bunker of Charles Green, a man who should be dead, who complained when I brought my cat into the bunker. It was dark, we couldn’t see a thing. None of us could. And then, we all heard and felt a loud boom. The bunker started the heat up, but the man who built the bunker put 5-6 layers of coolers on the inside of the giant door. The next day, I must have phased through the materials of the bunker door, I was the only one out. I saw federal agents going into a house. They eventually saw me behind a car and pointed their weapons at me. I put my hands up when suddenly, a laser beam fired at them, they tried fighting back, but got scared and ran. I assumed he was a friend till I realized he was a foe when he pointed his blaster at me. Suddenly, an IR light glowing head with hands told me to come with him. I did, and that’s when I woke up.

279,ZombiejesusX,1613232047,"Ashbreak, the last outpost on the edge of the desert. A few Adobe huts, and the barracks built into the side of a hill to shield it from the torrent of wind, and sand.  A few cages hang in the wind and dusty skeletons poke through the bars. The only business out here is mining and death. At night the lantern of the tower is the only light that can be seen through sandstorms. Some men gather inside, singing and laughing. Eventhough one can get in serious trouble, there's not much more they could do to you here.

""Go on do it again!"" Someone yelled
""Ya!"" A few cheered.
""Come on, nothing ever happens out here"" another shouted. They were circled around a man, who was sitting with his legs crossed on the floor.
""Alright, but we need to be quiet"" He said nodding towards the doorway.

In his right hand was a stick, about a foot long and burned on the end from poking around in the fire. The man chuckled and began drawing in the dirt. 1, 2, 3, 4, petals of a flower and in an instant it was there. A beautiful tropical flower, bright red and green growing out of the dirt floor.
""Oh my, that's.....that's so nice"" one man whispered leaning towards the flower.
""It smells like perfume"" he said taking a sniff.
""How are you doing this!?"" One of the guards shouted standing in the doorway. He began pushing through the crowd.
The man was humming and quickly drew a chicken. *pop* The chicken sprang from the dirt and started to peck around. The guards stopped and looked at the chicken. One of the shiny armor clad men bent down with his hand out, and it pecked his hand.
""IT'S REAL!"" He shouted, backing over and tripping on a large melon that had suddenly appeared. The men exploded into a fit of laughter. The guard jumped to his feet.
""THIS IS HERESY AND WITCHCRAFT! He shouted pointing at him.
""Oh this is nothing, you should see my paintings""
""You see dirt is only one color, only one shape""
""Painting has many colors, many shapes, and much, more, EMOTION"" He grabbed a large rolled up piece of paper and unfurled it onto the floor. *BOOF* in a second a roaring blaze rose to the ceiling and began to catch the wooden beams on fire.
""HE'S A DEMON!"" One of the guards shouted as they ran out into the night. ""Send help!""

""This one's real lads, we have to be on!"" He motioned  to the window. One by one they escaped from the now engulfed tower into the sandy dunes.
""Hope that lights the way"" The man chuckled as the roof collapsed into itself.
""Oh but the chicken was in there"" one man whispered peering over the sand.
""It wasn't real, and didn't suffer""
""I was going to eat it"" The man said looking, down and shuffling his feet.

Rummaging through a large sack the painter unfolds a long rectangle piece of paper. On it is drawn an ornate tabletop with silver platters filled with all sorts of food. Fruits and vegetables surround the roasted side of some massive beast. Just as the men were admiring the details of the cloth, the smell of cooked food hit their noses.
""Thank you, we're all so hungry""
""Don't take to much, but we need to eat if we're to survive the track across the desert""
