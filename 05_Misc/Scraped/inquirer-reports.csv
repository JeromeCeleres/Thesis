REYES
MANILA, Philippines — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said she intended to wrap up next year the preliminary examination of the allegations of crimes against humanity that President Rodrigo Duterte committed in his war on drugs, a move welcomed by the complainants who it saw as a “glimmer of hope” that he would be held liable for the thousands killed.
In a 77-page report on Thursday that included the Philippine case, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she had looked into the complaints that Mr. Duterte and other senior government officials “actively promoted and encouraged the killing of suspected or purported drug users and/or dealers.”

She said it was “in such context” that law enforcers and “unidentified assailants” had carried out thousands of killings throughout the country.
“During 2020, the Office (of the Prosecutor) will aim to finalize the preliminary examination in order to enable the prosecutor to reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines,” Bensouda said.FEATURED STORIES

Malacañang did not immediately respond to the Inquirer’s request for comment.
In a statement in February 2018, Bensouda emphasized that a preliminary examination was a process of examining available information to determine whether she should proceed with an investigation in accordance with the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC. 
A livid Mr. Duterte verbally attacked Bensouda and the ICC for acting on the complaint of crimes against humanity filed by lawyer Jude Josue Sabio in April 2017.
In August last year, a similar complaint was filed in the ICC by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) on behalf of the relatives of eight alleged victims of extrajudicial killings attributed to the President’s war on drugs.
“People are already inquiring and keenly awaiting an update on the case,” he added.
The Philippine National Police has reported that more than 6,600 have been killed since the antinarcotics campaign began on Mr. Duterte’s first day in office, but various local and international human rights groups say the death toll is in the tens of thousands.
For former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, one of the President’s arch critics, Bensouda’s report signaled that “justice is coming.”

He urged PNP officers who carried out the drug killings to now decide “whether you would fall with Duterte on being liable for crimes against humanity or you would partly cleanse your crime by being a witness for the ICC prosecutors.”
“Now, let me point out the obvious,” he said. “As Duterte steps down from office in just a little over two years, he would not be able to protect you.”
“In fact, even Duterte won’t be able to protect himself,” Trillanes said.
Bensouda said the ICC “retains jurisdiction over alleged crimes that have occurred on the territory of the Philippines during the period when it was
a state party to the (Rome) Statute”— from Nov. 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, which was the day before the Duterte government withdrew from the treaty.
She noted that the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction was “not subject to any time limit,” or even if the country were “no longer a state party to the ICC.”
“It validates our view and repudiates the Duterte administration’s weak and erroneous position on the effectivity, jurisdiction and independence of the ICC on this matter as a parallel or alternative legal remedy when victims are running out of options to turn to,” Olalia said.
“Most importantly, it validates the fact that all these years, what we have endured are self-serving and self-righteous justifications for extrajudicial killings and other acts amounting to crimes against humanity,” he said.
The ICC prosecutor said her office used “open source information,” including news reports and official statements by the Philippine government,
in examining the actions of the President and other public officials.
“Open source information indicates that a limited number of investigations and prosecutions have been initiated (and, in some cases, completed) at the national level in respect of direct perpetrators of certain criminal conduct that allegedly took place in the context of, or connection to, the (drug war) campaign,” she said.
In assessing the complains, Bensouda said her office reached out to “relevant stakeholders” and met with members of civil society organizations.


“The office has also been following with concern reports of threats and other measures apparently taken against human rights defenders, including those who have criticized the [drug war],” she said.

Lt. Col. Lino Capellan, regional police spokesperson, said only 46 drug suspects were killed during police operations in 2019 compared to 154 slain in the previous year.

He attributed the decline to the “reduced number of drug
personalities who resisted arrest, or those who engaged police in a shootout.”
He also said the decline in number could indicate that “fewer people engaged in illegal drugs” amid the government’s aggressive anti-drug campaign.FEATURED STORIES

He claimed, however, that many of the 46 persons killed “resisted arrest.”
“No rubout, no extra-judicial killing, these were all legitimate law enforcement operations,” Capellan said on the number of people killed during police raids. 
He said police seized about P60.1 million worth of illegal drugs during the 1,528 operations conducted for the period.
A total of 7,887.26 grams of shabu and 5,615.05 grams of marijuana were recovered.
Brig. Gen. Alfred Corpus, PRO-12 regional director, also reported at least 60 illegal firearms and 17 explosives confiscated by the police last year.
Capellan also noted a 22-percent drop in the number of drug
personalities the police arrested during the period.
A total of 1,576 drug personalities were arrested in 2019 and
were eventually charged. He claimed that of those arrested, 1,141 were drug peddlers and 435 were users.

Gen. Debold Sinas, director of the National Capital Region Police Office (File Photo from NCRPO)
CEBU CITY, Philippines – The war on drugs in Central Visayas escalated when Major General Debold Sinas was its top policeman.
But his stint in the region was marred by the rise of unsolved killings of people linked to the illegal drugs trade, said lawyer Alvin Odron, director of the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7).

“He (Sinas) had a colorful stint here in the region. During his watch, the number of killings definitely increased,” he told the Inquirer over the phone.
Odron, however, was not able to provide the figures as his documents were left in his office. Sinas was director of the Central Visayas police from July 2018 to October 2019 before he was assigned at the National Capital Region Police Office.FEATURED STORIES

CHR-7 chief investigator Leo Villarino said Sinas would always be remembered as the police official who was firm in his decision not to give human rights investigators copies of police reports on the various killings in the region.
“While we appreciate his relentless campaign against illegal drugs in Central Visayas, there were just so many killings under his watch as police director here,” he said. 
“The CHR-7 is conducting an investigation on these killings although we failed to get the documents from the police,” he added.
Jaime Paglinawan of Bayan Muna Central Visayas described Sinas as a “severe human rights violator” when he was Central Visayas’ police director.
“Aside from several persons killed during his anti-drugs campaign, a number of farmers accused as members of the New People’s Army in Negros Oriental were also killed during his watch,” Paglinawan said.
“And his usual defense was these persons tried to shoot it out with the police. That’s how we remember him (Sinas),” he added.
Sinas had repeatedly explained that it was just normal for his men to protect themselves from unlawful aggression.

The opposition Liberal Party (LP) has warned that the series of killings of local officials could be orchestrated to create an “atmosphere of lawlessness” that would give the Duterte administration grounds for the imposition of martial law.
Mayor Antonio Halili of Tanauan City, Batangas province, who had been linked by President Rodrigo Duterte to illegal drugs, was shot dead by a sniper during flag-raising rites in front of City Hall on Monday.

Bote and Lubigan had no known links to drugs. Police said no clear motive for the attack on Bote had emerged yet but they were looking at politics in the killing of Lubigan.
Atmosphere of lawlessness 
“What is going on? Are these deliberate and orchestrated attempts at creating an atmosphere of lawlessness to justify strongman rule?” Sen. Francis Pangilinan, LP president, said in a statement on Saturday.
“Another local executive in Luzon and two more in Mindanao were killed today even before authorities can provide the lead to the killing of two mayors earlier this week. The warehouse of suspected drug lord Peter Lim in Cebu was bombed on Thursday,” Pangilinan said.
The senator was referring to the killing in separate attacks on Saturday of Michael Magallanes, 38, a newly elected village councilor in Zamboanga City, and Nassif Palawan Bansil, 31, a municipal councilor of Kapatagan, Lanao del Sur province.
The LP leader said the Philippine National Police must take immediate action to solve the high-profile killings.
“A swift, sure and lawful move by the PNP to bring the killers behind bars is what the public awaits. At the same time, the police must ensure visibility, especially in key critical areas to prevent another bloody incident,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


“What we want is a safe, secure and peaceful society, not a gangster land,” he added.
Sen. Bam Aquino said the assassination of Lubigan showed the extent to which violence had become the norm.
“For violence to stop, the government must stop using force. If they keep using violence as the solution to the country’s problems, our society will not be peaceful and safe,” Aquino said.
Nothing to worry about
But PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde said the people should not be worried over the killings of local officials.
“We should not have any worries. We should not be afraid,” Albayalde told reporters in Albay province on Saturday when asked about the killings of Halili, Bote and Lubigan.
“These [killings] are not systematic. There is no pattern. We do not know if this involves politics. There are a lot of possible reasons,” he added.
The PNP chief said a thorough investigation of the killings was going on.
“We know that here in our country, every election season, although it is puzzling, before, during and after the election, there are elected officials who die,” he said.
Police said Lubigan had “no known enemy” and that they had ruled out illegal drugs.


Politics
Investigators said they were looking at politics behind the attack on Lubigan, as the vice mayor told people close to him on Friday that he intended to run for mayor in next year’s midterm elections.
“Initially, what we are looking at is politics,” said Chief Supt. Edward Carranza, director of the Calabarzon police.
Asked for details, Carranza said Lubigan was serving his last term and that investigators had received information that the vice mayor told people close to him on Friday that he would run for mayor in 2019.
In 2016, Lubigan ran as a candidate of the United Nationalist Alliance. Mayor Melandres de Sagun, who is also serving his last term, belongs to the same political party.
De Sagun is on leave.
“Trece Martires has this [record] of intense political rivalry,” Carranza said, but he declined to name any politician who might be involved in the attack on Lubigan.
In recent elections, however, candidates from local political clans have been running unopposed.
Cavite Gov. Juanito Crispin Remulla said the last election-related violence recorded in the province was about 11 years ago, but added that he, too, would describe as “hot” the political climate in the provincial capital. —WITH REPORTS FROM MICHAEL JAUCIAN AND MARICAR CINCO

Chief Supt. Eliseo Rasco, Soccsksargen police director, said fighting drugs remained to be the priority of police.
Cop suspect 
One of those killed was PO1 Rommel Barcellano, alias “Banjo,” 38, an intelligence agent of the South Cotabato police office.
Barcellano was supposedly on Mr. Duterte’s drug watch list. The policeman’s family denied he was involved in the drug trade.
Police carried out the war on drugs through two main strategies—“Oplan Tokhang” and “Oplan Double Barrel.”
Tokhang, derived from the Visayan words “toktok” (knock) and “hangyo” (plead), was supposed to be a bloodless method wherein police simply ask suspects during home visits to mend their ways.
Tokhang, however, had become associated with the bloodshed that characterized Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign.

Davao tactic
The President used the scheme to fight drugs in Davao City when he was still its mayor.
Human rights and religious groups have criticized the killings because most of the dead came from the poor.
In his third State of the Nation Address in July, the President reiterated that his antidrug campaign would be “chilling and relentless.”
In Soccsksargen, police data showed 42,946 individuals (40,327 suspected users and 2,619 suspected pushers) surrendered or presented themselves to authorities after 492,773 Tokhang visits by police since Mr. Duterte became President.

An outspoken Church critic of killings associated with President Rodrigo Duterte’s antidrug campaign appealed to people not to get numbed by the daily bloodshed they saw on the streets, warning that time would come when relatives of those unjustly slain would seek justice through revenge.

“People just watch and go on with business as usual. They have even gotten used to watching the killings as they happen and go past the victims unaffected,” he added.
“Children are exposed to so much violence,” David said. 
David and a group supporting relatives of victims of street executions denounced what they said was the unabated violence and impunity which had become routine following the launch of the President’s antidrug campaign, which he had described as “chilling and relentless.”
David said what alarmed him was the possibility of some victims’ families resorting to violence to bring justice to their loved ones.
Devastating impact
He also expressed fears for people reported missing after they had been linked to drugs.
“We’ve had cases of people abducted before, but their dead bodies were usually dumped a few days later,” David said.

Baigani, a group that supports wives, mothers and children of summary killings, said losing a parent might have devastating effects on children.
“Many of the families affected by the war on drugs are young families with children as young as newborns, and the rest are in their teens,” the group said.
“Left by one or both parents who have been killed or incarcerated, the young children are thrown into deep poverty with no support from the government at the local or national level,” it said.
Baigani was set to publish later this year a study conducted in three Metro Manila cities on the impact of the drug war on families.
It was prepared with Miriam College Department of Social Work, Ateneo de Manila University Department of Psychology and the Diocese of Novaliches.
David said he and Baigani continued to monitor drug-related killings in the Diocese of Kalookan, which comprised Caloocan City-South, Malabon City and Navotas City.
From Oct. 7 to 12 alone, the diocese recorded six summary killings in Caloocan, including the shooting of PO1 Marvin Anthony German at the village of 46.
German was shot by two motorcycle-riding assailants.
Regular occurrence
The list of people killed by motorcycle-riding men also included Noel Aljezera, 41, a known addict who was shot and killed on an overpass along Edsa at Bagong Barrio, Barangay 138, past 7 p.m. on Oct. 7.


PO3 Ernesto Estrellas, 37, was shot along C3 Road the following day.
On Oct. 10, around 10 p.m., 26-year-old single mother Clariz Marie Ocampo was also shot and killed by unknown assailants along Don Vicente Ang Street at Bagong Barrio.
Police later tagged Ocampo as a possible “police asset” and said a sachet of “shabu” (crystal meth) was found in her pocket.
Baigani said the sudden loss of a mother, like Ocampo, in a family could lead to worse events for children.

“The growing culture of impunity and apathy in our country which motivated heartless people to kill helpless brothers and sisters, including priests and pastors, are ominous signs that the evil spirit and its willing minions are determined to hurt Jesus through his Holy Church,” said the statement signed by Fr.

“We cannot allow this to continue to happen. We beseech our fellow Filipinos to be vigilant and be the voice of the voiceless and no longer idly stand by in the face of Church persecution and blatant assault on the human rights of our people,” it added.
Romano, an activist priest, was abducted by armed men in Barangay Tisa, Cebu City, on July 11, 1985. He was never seen again. 
His disappearance was remembered by friends, seminarians and members of the clergy with a Mass and lighting of candles at Redemptorist Church as well as a prayer service at a stone marker in Tisa, which describes the kidnappers as agents of “the deposed Marcos regime.”
Romano, 44, identified himself with the poor and joined protest actions denouncing human rights abuses.
“Thirty-three years have passed, and still no justice for Father Romano and other victims of martial law,” the statement said.
“Our mourning and lamentations become more intense and profound as we continue to witness these days the brutal deaths of our flocks, including our shepherd,” it said.
‘Stop killing our people’

The Redemptorist community appealed to the government: “Stop Church persecution. Stop killing our people.”
While the statement did not mention any names, the congregation was clearly alluding to President Duterte, whose brutal war on drugs has killed thousands of small-time drug users and pushers.
Fr. Crispin Mostajo, parish priest of Our Mother of Perpetual Help Church in Cebu City, said the series of killings in the country was alarming.
Three priests were among those killed.
On April 29, Fr. Mark Anthony Ventura, a human rights and antimining advocate, was shot dead after saying Mass in Gattaran town, Cagayan province.
On June 10, Fr. Richmond Nilo of the Diocese of Cabanatuan was shot by unidentified men while he was preparing to say Mass at Nuestra Señora de las Nieves Chapel in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija province.
A suspect in the killing of Nilo was arrested by police last Thursday.
On Dec. 4, 2017, Fr. Marcelito Paez was shot dead by motorcycle-riding men in Jaen, Nueva Ecija.
Paez, a retired priest, had facilitated the release of a political detainee.

“I didn’t expect this to happen. I’ll take over as mayor, but I’m saddened by the turn of events,” said Rocky Gabutan, the current vice mayor, as he wiped away tears.
Stripped of police control 
Blanco, 59, was the fifth to be slain among mayors the President had publicly linked to the illegal drug trade.
Killed were Mayors Antonio Halili of Tanauan City, Batangas province, on July 3; Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao province, in October 2016; Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte province, in November 2016; and Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. of Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental province, in July 2017.
Blanco was among more than 20 local officials stripped of control over the local police in October last year after the President linked them to the drug trade.
Since then, Blanco had feared for his life and even altered his routine, such as spending the night in his office several days of the week, for his safety.
At past Tuesday midnight, a white van arrived at the municipal hall, according to police investigators. Four persons alighted and, at gunpoint, ordered two watchmen to drop to the ground.

Burst of gunfire
“After a second, a burst of gunfire was heard from the mayor’s office and then the unidentified persons left,” SPO1 Dionisio Tagopa, one of the investigators, told the Inquirer.
The watchmen ran up to the mayor’s office and found him bloodied while sitting on a wooden bench in front of the television. Blanco was pronounced dead at the hospital.
“The mayor was there as he was sleeping in his office,” said Senior Insp. Jayr Palcon.
The two policemen manning a police station, four meters away from the municipal hall, did not hear the gunfire because of the rain, and failed to quickly respond to the shooting, Tagopa said.
Under surveillance
The rest of the lawmen were out to serve an arrest warrant against a crime suspect, he said.
“It just happened that many of our policemen were not here,” Tagopa said.
Celia Gabutan, municipal revenue collector, said the killers might have cased the mayor before the killing since they went up the same stairs that only he used.
“The mayor has been sleeping at his office for some time already. The suspects must have known this,” she said.


The municipal hall is neither manned by security guards nor equipped with closed-circuit television.
Blanco, in an earlier interview, said he was worried about his safety after his name was dragged into the drug trade.
“I’m afraid I might be assassinated. I just hope that they will understand that I had never been involved in illegal drugs,” he said.
“I’m really shocked. I have been serving the town for 22 years now, and my name was never besmirched until this issue came,” he added.
Blanco served as municipal councilor in 1995 before he was elected mayor in 1998, a position he held for nine years. In 2007, the term limit forced him to run for vice mayor; he won.
Blanco was reelected mayor in 2010, 2013 and 2016. —WITH REPORTS FROM INQUIRER RESEARCH AND AFP

Seven other suspected members of the Manite gang, which authorities also linked to gunrunning, were arrested.

Prior to the operation, a team from the Station Drug Enforcement Unit (SDEU) of the Makati police received a tip about a meeting taking place Tuesday afternoon between two groups, one of which was led by a woman known as “Ganda,” on  Bunyi Street, Buting, in Pasig.
Insp. Jeson Vigilla, the SDEU chief, said that when they arrived at the area, they spotted the gang members in a white Toyota Vios (CSC311).FEATURED STORIES

As the police moved in, one of the passengers fired at them, setting off a running gun battle that ended with the Vios being cornered on A. Tanangco Street.
One of the suspects, a certain “Topher” from Comembo, Makati, was killed. 
An SDEU member, PO1 Tinpee Merdegia, was wounded.
The three other passengers of the Vios surrendered, among them “Ganda,” a call center agent whose real name was Theresa Elva de Paz. The others were identified as John Rapsing, a former Army soldier; and Daniel Novie Bernardo.
Father and son
Four other gang members were arrested on Bunyi Street—Mark Tampos, Joharah Sally Imogbel, Jennelyn Borromeo and Jhon Michael Caliboso.
The police said they found five plastic packets of “shabu” (crystal meth), a digital weighing scale and a .45-caliber Kimber Ultra Carry pistol inside their suspects’ vehicle.

Norman Ace Manite, the alleged leader of the group, remains at large.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1135859/pnp-expects-more-casualties-in-drug-war,PNP expects more casualties in drug war,"05:39 AM July 01, 2019","MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police expects more casualties as its campaign against illegal drugs shifts to higher gear, targeting this time the big drug syndicates that supply the banned substances.
In an interview over radio station dzBB on Sunday, PNP spokesperson Col. Bernard Banac said the intensified anti-illegal drug campaign this month would be aimed at drug supply reduction.

“We want to defeat the illegal drug menace because all of us are its victims … We expect a higher number of possible casualties in our campaign against illegal drugs because we have drug offenders who refuse to stop engaging in the narcotics trade and there are still many of them who continue to resist arrest and fight it out when caught,” Banac said.
He noted that even PNP personnel would end up as casualties if they were involved in the illegal drug trade.FEATURED STORIES

But Banac said that casualties would be avoided as much as possible in any police operation.
“We need to enforce the law and if a suspect resists and fights it out … we can do nothing but use equal force,” he said. 
Based on PNP data, 6,600 drug suspects and 49 policemen were killed in the war on drugs from July 2016 to May 2019 during 153,000 anti-illegal drug operations nationwide, which also resulted in the arrest of some 240,000 suspects.
“Despite our efforts, illegal drugs continue to flood our country. This is what we have to stop, the network of narcotics supply,” Banac explained.
The PNP spokesperson noted that big drug syndicates were the sources of illegal drugs.

Halili had as been indicted for his alleged involvement in drugs and condemned by the Commission on Human Rights for his “walk of shame” campaign for drug pushers in Tanauan.

“It’s now open season for killers and assassins to ply their trade with impunity,” Villarin added.
Meanwhile, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano tagged the incident as “another proof of the culture of violence perpetuating in our country right now.” 
The opposition lawmaker also suspects that the slaying is related to the Duterte administration’s brutal war on drugs, as it took place after “President Duterte’s speech in Bohol wherein he egged vice mayors to replace their mayors through illegal means.”
“While an investigation is yet to be carried out, there is an impression that this case is related to the Duterte administration’s war on drugs,” Alejano said. “What is more troubling is that this heinous crime comes at the heels of President Duterte’s speech in Bohol wherein he egged vice mayors to replace their mayors through illegal means.”
But regardless of who committed the crime, Alejano said “what we are seeing are emboldened perpetrators who have no respect for the law.”
“Cases such as this heighten the sense of impunity already prevailing under the present situation of peace and order in our communities,” he said.
“Nasaan na ngayon ang pangakong pagsugpo ng kriminalidad sa loob lamang ng tatlo hanggang anim na buwan na iniyayabang ng administrasyon?” he added.“Instead of feeling safe, Filipinos are feeling more unsecured today.”

Earlier, Malacañang condemned the assassination, whom presidential spokesperson Harry Roque called “napakatibay na kasangga” (a strong ally) of President Rodrigo Duterte in the war on drugs.
Halili, known for his shame campaign for parading drug suspects and criminals around his city, was earlier included in the list of “narco-politicians.” But the mayor denied having links to the illegal narcotics trade.

TANAUAN CITY — Antonio Halili came down hard on illegal drugs even as he also fended off allegations that he was a protector of drug syndicates and expressed fear for his life shortly after the Duterte administration launched its brutal crackdown on narcotics.
Until Monday, the tough-talking mayor of this city had been receiving death threats, but nothing specific.

“We are shocked, we are saddened,” Vice Mayor Jhoanna Villamor, who stood next to the mayor, told a radio station shortly after the shooting.
Halili was declared dead on arrival at C.P. Reyes Hospital. 
Police were looking at the mayor’s shame campaign against drug suspects and criminals as one of the possible motives for the attack.
Halili was the fourth mayor killed in Mr. Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, which has left thousands of drug suspects dead and drawn condemnation from local and international human rights organizations.
The three other mayors killed were Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao province, in October 2016; Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte province, in November 2016; and Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. of Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental province, in July 2017.
Elected to a second term in 2016, Halili talked and acted tough on drugs and crime like Mr. Duterte, earning him the moniker “Little Digong” in the city south of Manila.

Halili gained notoriety when he paraded drug pushers and petty thieves, while they carried cardboard signs specifying their offenses. Human rights officials were alarmed.
“[My intention] is to warn the people. If you see these people [tagged as drug users], you would not want any of your family near them,” the mayor told the Inquirer in 2016 in defense of his shame campaign.
Halili’s name later appeared on Mr. Duterte’s so-called narcolist of officials allegedly linked to illegal drugs.
He was among 1,000 mayors who separately met with the President in Malacañang in January 2017 to clear their names.
In October 2017, Halili was stripped of supervisory powers over the local police as illegal drugs proliferated in his city amid allegations that he might have been involved. He denied the allegations.
Police crackdown
In August 2016, Halili said he supported Mr. Duterte’s campaign but believed drug kingpins should be the main targets. Otherwise, he pointed out, thousands would be killed.
VIEW TO A KILL A photographer checks a grassy area where a sniper may have shot Mayor Halili about 150 meters away.
In the interview with Reuters, Halili expressed apprehension over the way police carried out the crackdown and the reliability of their intelligence.
He voiced fears he might be accused of colluding with drug syndicates.
“If you are the mayor, and if somehow your views differ from the police, they will create a story, say you are into drugs and go after you and kill you. What can you do?” he said.


After Monday’s shooting, investigators scoured a nearby grassy knoll from where the gunman might have fired the shot.
“They did not see anybody approach him. They just heard a gunshot so the assumption or allegation was it could have been a sniper shot,” said Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde.
Extraordinary distance
Supt. Renato Mercado, Tanauan police chief, said the shot was fired from about 150 meters away.
“The distance from the position was extraordinary. It could not be done by an ordinary person. His skill can be compared to a trained sniper,” Mercado said.
Albayalde said investigators were looking into the connection between the killing and Halili’s “walk of shame” campaign.
“As a city mayor, he might have embarrassed and hurt people because that [campaign] was controversial,” he told reporters at Camp Crame.
Last week, Halili submitted additional documents to the National Police Commission to clear his name of the drug allegations, according to city information officer Gerard Laresma.
“[Halili] was telling us there were threats but nothing really specific. What he would always say was: if it’s my time, it’s my time,” Laresma said. —With reports from Jaymee T. Gamil, Inquirer Reseearch and the wires

MANILA, PPhilippines — When the bloody war on drugs claimed its first victims in 2016, Marissa Lazaro believed that the fatalities in police operations were truly drug addicts.

She added: “I know my son is dead but if I do not speak up, the killings will continue.” 
Lazaro has even started bringing her grandchildren to rallies as she believes it is just right for them to be aware of the realities of the drug war.
As for allegations that she was being paid to join protests, Lazaro pointed out that they would not be going out in the streets if they were not fighting for something.
“I want my son to have a name, not just a number. He was not a drug addict,” she said.

Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin on Wednesday blamed the deadly attacks on two local officials this week on President Rodrigo Duterte who, he said, inspired disrespect for the rule of law by promising protection to police who would kill drug users and dealers.
According to the opposition lawmaker, the shooting deaths of the mayors of Tanauan City, Batangas province, and General Tinio, Nueva Ecija province, showed that once the rule of law is abandoned, “anybody with a gun and a grudge has a license to kill people without worrying about the consequences.”

No prosecution
He said the President himself gave the license to kill by repeatedly assuring police and soldiers that they would not be prosecuted for carrying out his brutal war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

A sniper felled Mayor Antonio Halili during flag-raising rites in front of City Hall in Tanauan on Monday morning. Halili didn’t make it alive to hospital.
On Tuesday afternoon, two motorcycle-riding men pumped five bullets into General Tinio Mayor Ferdinand Bote as he was being driven out of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) compound in Cabanatuan City. 
Bote was taken to the hospital across the street from the NIA compound but he was already dead when he got there, according to the police.
Halili was a supporter of the President, but he once appeared on the President’s list of narcopoliticians.
Bote was not on that list. Police said they were looking at politics and business in their investigation of his slaying.
Sense of insecurity
The killings have worsened Filipinos’ sense of insecurity, Villarin said.

“Duterte’s attack against institutions upholding the rule of law has led to a weakened state and a population desperate for security thereby pushing everyone to bad decisions culminating [in] a vicious cycle of violence that destroys society,” he said.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque denied there was a culture of impunity in the country.
“We continue to adhere to the rule of law and consider the recent killings of high-profile figures an attempt to erode confidence in the President, whose main platform of governance rests on fighting crimes,” Roque said in a statement.
He gave assurance that the police were “sparing no effort to find and capture the killers of the two slain mayors.”
Gabriela Rep. Emmi de Jesus condemned the killings and called for a thorough and impartial investigation.
“A thorough and impartial investigation is needed and hope these cases would not be just another contribution to the worsening culture of impunity,” De Jesus said.
Vice President Leni Robredo appealed to the police to investigate the killings and take steps to prevent further bloodshed.
“It’s as if no one is spared, from priests to civil servants and government officials, to loiterers and the youth,” Robredo said.
“Are we going to allow violence to finally reign in our country?” she said.
Martial law


Opposition Sen. Francis Pangilinan said the killings could be used by the Duterte administration as grounds for the imposition of martial law on the entire country.
Mindanao remains under martial law in the aftermath of a terrorist occupation of Marawi City last year.
Pangilinan, president of the Liberal Party, said he would not discount the possibility of the Duterte administration using the assassinations of Halili and Bote and other recent high-profile killings as grounds for expanding military rule throughout the country.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if such a scenario unfolds, with the majority in Congress endorsing it,” Pangilinan said in a text message.
“After the bizarre quo warranto decision ousting [Chief Justice Maria Lourdes] Sereno, any and all official acts of this administration can be legally justified by the Supreme Court using twisted and witless legal reasoning,” he added.
“The only recourse now is to work toward forging and mobilizing a broad unity among our citizens in defense of our democratic rights, our sovereignty and the rule of law,” he said.
Law and order breakdown
Sen. Nancy Binay said the killings of Halili and Bote should not be considered isolated cases, but should be seen as a “systemic failure” of law enforcement.
But Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a former Philippine National Police chief, told reporters that the Philippines had not yet reached the point of law and order breakdown.
“But I fear that we may reach that if the PNP does not initiate control measures,” Lacson said.


Lacson said he did not agree with suggestions that the President’s incendiary rhetoric had triggered the killings.
“No, I don’t think so. Especially in local politics, political battles are so fierce, they resort to killing each other. But it is incumbent upon the PNP to do something about it. How? Control the movement of firearms,” he said. —With reports from Christine O. Avendaño, Vince F. Nonato and DJ Yap

Myka Ulpina was the latest to be added to a growing list of children who had died in connection with President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs.

Life wasted
“Another life was again wasted and added to the thousands of innocent victims of this spurious government campaign that has led to nothing,” she added. 
De Lima, who was indicted for drug trafficking after her scathing criticism of the President’s drug war, maintained that the administration’s antinarcotics strategy was a “sham and a complete failure as it failed to arrest the entry of illegal drugs into the country.”
She also assailed the Philippine National Police for claiming that the antidrug campaign was a success even after Mr. Duterte himself had repeatedly admitted that it was a failure.
De Lima said that PNP chief, Police Gen. Oscar Albayalde, issued the “declaration to justify the brutal killings under the Duterte regime.”
“They conveniently set aside the fact that innocents continue to die because of this murderous drug war,” she stressed.
“Does this government consider this a victory? Do they consider it a victory when after three years, billions of pesos in illegal drugs are being smuggled into the country while the real drug lords still go scot-free?” De Lima asked. —Marlon Ramos

But SDET leader Senior Insp. Maynard Pascual, “upon seeing the resistance from the determined suspect and sensing their lives [were] in imminent danger,” shot Lumanlan.
Sison also fired at the suspect, said Senior Insp. Wilfredo Sangel, chief of investigation of the Pasay police.
Lumanlan was brought to Pasay City General Hospital where he died at 2:55 a.m. due to three gunshot wounds.
Recovered from him were his gun and several sachets of drugs, two of them containing “shabu” or crystal meth worth P6,000.
Sangel said that Lumanlan had a police record for his involvement in drugs and robbery-holdup cases. He was arrested in July 2017 on robbery charges although he was later released.

Francis Pangilinan again pushed for the mandatory autopsy of people who died under questionable circumstances.
Prevailing civil registry rules already require autopsies of those who died under questionable circumstances but Pangilinan’s proposal would make it a matter of law even if the next of kin waive an autopsy.

“The original purpose of this measure is to help investigate the increasing daily killings way back in 2017,” said Pangilinan, who had proposed a similar measure two years ago.
Under the bill, autopsies will be mandated for deaths resulting from the commission of crimes; deaths with an unidentifiable cause; deaths under suspicious circumstances; deaths occurring from violence or trauma; operative and perioperative deaths not readily explainable by prior disease; deaths where the body remains unidentified or unclaimed; deaths in prison or in police custody; and deaths of persons  to be cremated, buried at sea, or any other form that may render them unavailable to future examinations.FEATURED STORIES

A ranking military officer appealed for calm, saying investigators should be given enough time to ferret out the truth about the killings of the nine men during an antidrug operation by a team of policemen and soldiers.

Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, head of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division (ID) based in Maguindanao province, said the military was represented in the joint ceasefire committee which monitors compliance with a truce that formed part of a peace agreement between the MILF and the government.

The MILF, Sobejana said, sought the investigation.
MILF leaders had said they were lodging a protest against policemen and soldiers of the 6th ID who were involved in the drug raid that led to the killings of nine MILF members on Friday and Saturday in the village of Kilada here. 
Butch Malang, head of the MILF Coordinating Committee on the Cessation of Hostilities (CCCH), said the nine fatalities were disarmed then shot at close range.
But police said the slain men were drug suspects who fought it out during an antidrug operation that started on Friday and went on until the wee hours of Saturday.
Police said drugs and guns were seized although they could not declare the volume of confiscated drugs.
Chief Insp. Sunny Leoncito, Matalam police chief, said the raiding team was serving a search warrant issued by Judge Alandrex Betoya, of the Regional Trial Court Branch 16, on Dadting Kasan and Intan Aban, a female MILF member.
Leoncito said the police-military team was on its way to the village of Kilada, where Kasan and Aban lived, but was met with heavy gunfire.

An hourlong gunfight led to the wounding and subsequent death of seven suspects on Friday.
He said the team was forced to withdraw because of the superior firepower of the suspects and returned on Saturday when two more suspects were killed.
But Malang, in a letter to Mohagher Iqbal, chair of the MILF panel overseeing the implementation of the peace agreement, said the dead men belonged to the 105th base command of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (Biaf), the armed wing of the MILF.
‘Massacred’
Malang said the men had not fired but yielded their guns.
“After the Biaf troops were disarmed, they were deliberately shot by the operatives,” Malang said in the letter.
Von Al-Haq, Biaf spokesperson, said: “They were shot after they were disarmed when they could no more defend themselves,” said Al-Haq. “So, they were massacred.”
Malang said no drugs were recovered during the raid, contrary to the claim of police. —Edwin Fernandez

Dimalanta is among the latest victims in the Duterte administration’s bloody war on drugs which rages in poor communities like the back alleys of Sta. Cruz.
It has killed mostly male breadwinners, leaving behind what its critics call “a nation of widows and orphans.” 
No drug involvement
Police reports said Dimalanta shot at PO1 Evan Repil of the Sta. Cruz police station three times but missed, prompting the officers to fire back.
Felled by several bullets to the chest, he was rushed to the nearby Chinese General Hospital but died from his wounds.
Police said Dimalanta was a notorious drug peddler—a claim his grief-stricken family condemned as an “unbelievable lie.”
Michelle insisted that her partner was a loving husband and a doting dad.

“Even if we were neck-deep in debt he could never have done that, not ever,” she said. “I swear on my children, even if you cut his corpse open and test him for drugs.”
Twisting narrative
Barangay officials said Dimalanta had no previous criminal record.
Dimalanta was “kindhearted and generous,” swore his younger sister Vina.
On the day he died, she said, he even volunteered to help out fellow tricycle driver Marvin Rosario convey two female passengers.
Cemetery residents told a story different from the official police account.
They said two female strangers alighted at the far end of 2nd Street and then inexplicably walked back to where they came from.
Police officers in civilian clothes suddenly appeared and hauled two men to the edge of the cemetery.
One of the residents said he saw Dimalanta being forced into a narrow alley between tombs. “The police warned us to leave, so we ran like hell. We all heard at least 12 gunshots,” he said.
Police then hailed a passing tricycle to rush Dimalanta’s body to the hospital.


Rosario was also arrested and later detained at the Sta. Cruz station. But the spot report on his arrest did not say he was with Dimalanta during the shooting.
Instead, it said Rosario was arrested at 2 a.m. on June 15 at the cemetery for gambling and drug possession.
The Inquirer tried to reach out to the station commander, Supt. Julius Domingo, but was told he was out.
Humble, kindhearted
Because he only finished grade school, Dimalanta had been a tricycle driver for most of his life, Michelle said.
His parents separated and left with their new partners when he was still young, so he had to look after his two sisters.
Dimalanta’s four children — aged 5, 4, 2 and 10 months — all had asthma.
Michelle said he was also nursing a kidney ailment but spent his meager income on diapers and food.
“He was the type to skip meals and drive twice as long just to earn a little extra,” Dimalanta’s elder sister Joan said.
Underneath the hard work, however, was a breadwinner’s desperation and exhaustion, embodied in a brief note Dimalanta wrote on his cell phone two days before he died.


It read: “Lord, please help me. I don’t know what else to do. I can’t take it seeing my family suffer. I love them very much but I can’t do much more … I don’t wish to do evil.”
“It was so hard for him but he never wanted us to worry,” Michelle said. “Day after day, we both struggled to make ends meet … How can we now survive without him?”
No celebration
Dimalanta’s death cut short his promise to take his family out for a meal to celebrate Father’s Day, Michelle said.
They were supposed to go to Mass at Quiapo Church on Sunday to thank the Lord for healing the kids, who were all stricken with chicken pox last month.
“It’s his birthday,” his eldest daughter Alexa said, or so she thought. “We were going to eat out. I even have a gift for him, but it’s a secret.”
Her father is “dead,” she said, although she does not know what it means. “Mama said he won’t be back. But last night he told me to eat first.”
She misses her dad, something that Michelle knows she would have to reckon with when they bury him.
“It’s only going to get harder from now on,” Michelle said. “But we’re determined to fight. We’re sure Alex can’t rest until we bring him justice.”

Investigators are looking at illegal drugs as one of the motives in the killing of an outgoing Pasay City barangay chair.
Teresita Biscocho, who was pronounced dead at 9 p.m. on Sunday, was the incumbent Barangay 1 chair. In the May 14 elections, she ran for and won a seat in the barangay council.

Senior Insp. Wilfredo Sangel, head of the Pasay police investigation section, said that probers were looking at the alleged involvement in illegal drugs of Biscocho who was considered a “high-value target.”
“But we cannot make [any conclusions] yet since we just updated our drug watchlist and she may have been removed from [it],” he added.

Sangel said that investigators had ruled out politics since the newly elected barangay chief, Daniel Asuncion, was the victim’s nephew.
A hunt has been launched for the gunman who was caught on a closed-circuit TV camera passing through F.B. Harrison Street while escaping. He was described as 5’5” tall, of bulky build and dressed in a black shirt and denim jeans. He was also wearing a helmet and sunglasses.
Sangel said the suspect appeared to be left-handed.

Parojinog was the third town mayor killed in a police operation under President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody war on drugs.
The Parojinogs had appeared before then Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa in July 2016 after they were linked to Colanggo. 
The Parojinogs also handed over firearms for police custody after their licenses were revoked by the PNP.
The elder Parojinog denied the President’s allegation.
“I am not involved in illegal drugs. In fact, I am against it and I have been fighting it since I became mayor in 2001,” Parojinog said then.
The Parojinogs of Ozamiz are known to be the leaders of the Kuratong Baleleng crime syndicate, which grabbed national attention because of a string of brazen bank robberies, kidnappings and a sensational rubout case against ranking police officers until Reynaldo and his brother Renato ran for public office.

At the height of President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody campaign against illegal drugs, the names of three teenagers became bywords for police abuse: Kian Loyd delos Santos, Carl Angelo Arnaiz and Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman.
The deaths of Delos Santos and Arnaiz in particular, who were gunned down as they were on their knees, begging for their lives, sparked widespread outrage in a nation that had become desensitized to the almost-daily killings.

“That would be my worst nightmare — that my son would be forgotten,” Michelle told the Inquirer in a recent interview. “That’s why we pray that Aldrinne’s death would somehow be like Kian’s.”
A Grade 6 student, Pineda was hanging out with his friends at the Vitas slaughterhouse in Tondo, Manila, when he was shot by PO2 Omar Malinao of the Raxabago police station on the night of March 2. 
Malinao, who at that time was on duty against looters, had claimed he was running after a group of rowdy teenagers when he “tripped and accidentally pulled the trigger” of his 9mm firearm.
The lone “stray bullet” went through the boy’s stomach. He died eight hours later at Tondo Medical Center but not before telling his father that it was a policeman who had shot him.
Then came a twist in the case: It was later revealed that during the operation to remove the bullet in Pineda’s stomach, Dr. Sa-adi Sacar also took out his kidneys without his family’s consent, according to Michelle. The boy died the following day.
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) medico-legal officer Joseph Jimenez said that removing both kidneys when at least one was needed to survive was a “drastic move” that would require a “very good explanation” from Sacar.
No explanation from doctor

“I can only imagine what [Aldrinne] went through that night,” Michelle said. “He must have been in so much agony…maybe he might have lived were his kidneys not removed. The doctor did not even explain to us what he did.”
The family has since filed a formal complaint in the CHR, calling for an investigation of Sacar and another doctor, Timothy Jerome Venture, both of whom reportedly operated on Pineda.
Malinao, on the other hand, is facing two murder cases—one filed by the police in the Manila City Prosecutor’s Office; and the other filed by the CHR in the Office of the Ombudsman.
Hilda Clave, the Pinedas’ legal counsel, said that she would soon file a motion to withdraw the case in Manila to avoid being accused of forum shopping.
“We need to keep working on Aldrinne’s case. It’s the only way we know we can achieve justice,” Michelle said.
According to her, it was the knowledge that her son’s shooter was a policeman that made her family determined to pursue the case.
“Several people are trying to persuade us to reach a settlement with the Raxabago police. They say Aldrinne is already dead, that fighting back won’t bring him back. But I want [Malinao] to rot in jail. If he is free, he [may] do [what he did to my son] to other kids.”
“If [Sacar] is also liable for Aldrinne’s death, then he, too, must face the consequences. We were there, my grandson was fighting to live. He would have survived had the doctor made the right call,” Corazon, Pineda’s grandmother, added.
Fortunately, the Pineda family has found some allies, among them activist priest Flavie Villanueva and human rights movement Artikulo Trese. The group helped fund the boy’s hospital, funeral and legal expenses.
Systemic evil


Though Pineda was technically not a casualty of the war on drugs, Villanueva said that the boy was still a victim of “[systemic] evil,” empowered by a President who promised to exonerate policemen who kill.
The Pineda family sees a long and tough fight ahead but they remain hopeful. “At least [Kian] got the justice he deserved and the cops who killed him now face trial. As for us, we have yet to see the face of Aldrinne’s killer. Maybe, if we press harder, we, too, will have our day in court,” Corazon said.

The official death toll is much lower than the 12,000 estimated by an international human rights group and the 20,322 counted by an opposition senator as the number of fatalities in President Duterte’s war on drugs.

Arrested were 142,069 people, including 217 elected officials, 48 uniformed personnel and 239 government employees.
The PNP and PCOO released the figures to also point out that the Duterte administration was winning the war on drugs. 
“However, despite the significant gains, many side issues and, to some extent, deliberate disinformation, continue to obscure the true picture of our antidrug operations often mislabeling the pure good intention of the campaign with human rights issues and political undertones,” said PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde.
‘Confused’
Rights group Karapatan on Monday said Malacañang was getting confused with its numbers game that it could no longer provide a consistent figure on its so-called successes in its drug war.
Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay cited the conflicting figures released by the PNP.
“Last December 2017, they reported at least 20,000 cases of individuals killed in the course of their antinarcotics campaign from July 1, 2016, to September 2017. Now, they have shaved off the figures to project a less murderous campaign,” she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


New York-based Human Rights Watch has estimated that more than 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers, mostly from poor families, have been killed since Mr. Duterte launched his war on drugs on July 1, 2016.
Human Rights Watch has estimated 4,000 people have been killed either by police or by “unidentified gunmen.”
Extrajudicial killings
Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV gave a far bigger number.
In February, Trillanes, citing figures in the administration’s 2017 year-end report, said the number of deaths and extrajudicial killings under the war on drugs had reached 20,322.
Among those killed in police operations and vigilante-style attacks from July 2016 to December 2017 were at least 74 minors, according to Children’s Legal Rights and Development Center.
A complaint has been filed against Mr. Duterte in the International Criminal Court accusing him of crimes against humanity in connection with his bloody war on drugs.
Albayalde said the Real Numbers Forum would allow the public “to see the complete picture of the national anti-illegal drugs situation in its true, unadulterated and objective state sans any biased opinion and emotional manipulation.”
He said the numbers would still go up because of the extent of the illegal drugs problem.
“There are only a few barangays that were cleared [of illegal drugs] as of this time,” he told reporters.


He pointed out that success in the drug war was “really difficult to quantify” and that it could only be measured by its effect on the country’s peace and order.
He cited a vast reduction on street-level drug dealers who openly sell shabu.
‘Relentless’
In a statement, Albayalde said: “PNP anti-illegal drug operations had been relentless and uncompromising throughout the entire period that we were given a new lease on waging this campaign with greater efficiency, and with fewer violent confrontations between law enforcers and offenders.”
He was referring to Malacañang’s decision in December last year to allow the PNP to help the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in the war on drugs.
Mr. Duterte took away his war on drugs from the PNP last October and designated instead the PDEA as the “sole agency” that would carry out operations against the narcotics trade amid criticisms of its methods.
Last December, Mr. Duterte ordered the PNP to actively support the PDEA in the war on drugs, noting that there was a “notable resurgence in illegal drugs.” —Reports from Jeannette I. Andrade, Melvin Gascon and Inquirer Research

Under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Acts of 2002 (Republic Act No. 9165), a drug dependent may voluntary submit himself to authorities for treatment and rehabilitation for a minimum period of six months.

The PNP’s Oplan Tokhang in 2016 led to a bloated number of drug surrenderers in the first months of the drug war, but PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Benigno Durana said that around a million of them would still have to undergo community-based drug rehabilitation programs.
In a forum with journalists and members of the academe held in Quezon City on Friday, Durana said that the “body count” – or the number of deaths related to police antidrug operations – was not a good way to measure the impact of the war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

According to Durana, the PNP is “continuously developing” the campaign against illegal drugs, which also calls for crafting and implementing recovery and wellness programs for drug users.
But the spokesperson said local government units and the civil society would also have to play big role in institutionalizing such activities. 
“Local government units also have to realize that law enforcement is not the solution to the problem on the war on drugs,” Durana said. “This is not a law enforcement problem, but the problem of the entire Filipino people. A lot more still needs to be done.”
He urged local government units and civil society organizations to help the PNP in advocating for rehabilitation programs and other institutional measures to ensure the reform of drug dependents.
During the forum, an independent study conducted by the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) also pointed out the staggering difference between the deaths resulting from anti-drug operations conducted by the PNP and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).
As recorded by CMFR, the PNP’s conduct of the first phase of the drug war resulted in more than 2,500 deaths.
But when PDEA took over the campaign on Oct. 17, 2017, the CMFR recorded only nine deaths resulting from antidrug operations.

But Durana dismissed the figures as “a matter of personnel size,” noting that since the police force far outnumbered PDEA, the number of killings in police operations would naturally be higher.
Durano also clarified that the 26,000 recorded homicide cases under investigation (HCUIs) did not represent the total number of drug war-related deaths.
Journalists pointed out that that the change of terms in PNP drug war reports – from extrajudicial killings to deaths under investigation and HCUIs – has brought confusion in media reporting and public understanding about the real figures in the drug war. /atm

In a resolution passed during its regular session on Tuesday, the council agreed to invite the city police chief for a briefing on the city’s peace and order situation.
The resolution, sponsored by Councilor Armand Parcon, cited killings and other crimes committed with impunity in just days.FEATURED STORIES

The killings had caused “anxiety” among many residents, according to the resolution.
Tricycle driver 
On the same day the resolution was passed, an unidentified assailant shot dead tricycle driver Gerardo Mamarion Jr. at a variety store in the village of Ungka in Jaro District.
A former drug user, Mamarion died from gunshot wounds in the head and chest.
Four days earlier, on Sept. 7, two drug suspects were separately gunned down in the city.
Four unidentified assailants in two motorcycles shot dead Donn Azucena at the village of Calumpang in Molo District.
Azucena, 39, who had presented himself to police as a drug user, was waiting for a jeepney ride with his wife when he was repeatedly shot.

Motorcycle killers
Hours later, two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle repeatedly shot Rolando Puda at the village of Ingore in Lapaz District. He died at Western Visayas Medical Center from at least six bullet wounds.
The resolution was addressed to Senior Supt. Henry Biñas but Biñas was relieved from his post and reassigned to the regional police headquarters as part of a reshuffling of officers.
Senior Supt. Martin Defensor, the new city police chief, said he welcomed the invitation so he can present plans in solving the crimes.
Be alarmed
He said Chief Supt. John Bulalacao, Western Visayas police director, had already issued an order for police to solve the crimes.
Church leaders in Western Visayas had earlier raised alarm over the surge in the killing of drug suspects in police operations.
“Everybody should be alarmed,” said Msgr. Meliton Oso, executive director of Jaro Archdiocese Social Action Center.
He said the Church’s social action directors in Western Visayas “are alarmed at what is happening.”
He said while they support the war on drugs, they opposed summary executions.


Drug suspects were being killed in operations by police who were better armed and were trained to make arrests, he added.
“They could have maimed them if indeed the suspects attempted to fight back,” he said.
Antidrug police operations have led to the killing of six suspects in the last 10 days in Iloilo and Antique provinces.
At least 63 drug suspects had been killed in police operations in Western Visayas since July 2016.
More than 10 others have been killed by unidentified assailants.

Town mayors and their village heads should also take some of the blame for deaths in the government’s war on drugs.
Ateneo School of Government dean Ronald Mendoza said some local officials had enabled deadly encounters in their jurisdictions with some narcopoliticians ending up on law enforcers’ order of battle.

In his presentation during the “Media and the War on Drugs” forum of the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, Mendoza said the drug war should not be assessed only through body count, but also through local governance and environment.

Mendoza said local officials supported deadly antidrug operations in their areas at the start of the drug war because they wanted to get rewards from higher officials.
But this resulted in quelling criticism of the drug war and led to a culture of impunity that has since overtaken drug enforcers. 
However, there are also mayors and village heads who undertook measures to prevent killings in their jurisdictions, he said.
“We know a number of mayors who wanted to emphasize rehabilitation [and] partnered with the police, the Church, academic institutions and tried to protect their citizens [and] minimize the killings,” Mendoza said.
Mendoza said he conducted a study that suggested that deaths in the drug war were not really widespread but concentrated only in certain areas, like Quezon City, Caloocan and Manila in Metro Manila, and Bulacan, Cebu and Pampanga in the provinces.
For further study
But Mendoza stressed that the matter needed to be studied further, particularly the dynamics between mayors, barangay chairs and law enforcers as well as the conditions in their jurisdictions.

Barangay officials, for instance, were empowered to shape the drug war by identifying suspected drug users and dealers in their communities with the police, but there was no process identified to verify such information.
Mendoza urged mayors to take a more proactive approach by offering alternative measures to promote reform and prevent further deaths.

CEBU CITY — Bladen Skyler Abatayo had wanted to become a priest when he grew up.
But the 4-year-old boy’s dreams perished when he was hit by a stray bullet inside his room around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, July 10.

The bullet that pierced his heart came from a gun used during a police antidrug operation near the boy’s house at Sitio Bato in Barangay Ermita.

“I had asked him to practice writing down his name. Yesterday was the first time he had written down his full name. I was very happy, but I did not know that [that day] was also his last,” said Skyler’s father, Marc Anthony, holding back tears.
According to Marc Anthony, he left the child with his wife, Gwynn, around 12 noon to buy spare parts for his motorcycle. 
Checking a pot session
“Had I known that this would happen, I would have brought him with me despite the weather. I deeply regret not doing so,” he said.
Senior Insp. John Kareen Escober, chief of the Carbon Police Station, said four of his men went to Sitio Bato on Tuesday afternoon to verify a report that a group of men was allegedly having a pot session in an abandoned house adjacent to the Abatayos’ home.
Escober said that when the policemen arrived at the abandoned house, they saw four men, two of them armed, having a pot session on the second floor.
When one of the surprised men drew his weapon, a policeman jumped at him and the two grappled for the gun, he said.

Escober said the bullet that killed the child came from the gun of the suspect, adding that not one of his men fired his service firearm.
The suspects escaped and the policemen failed to give chase, he said, without elaborating.
Neighbors’ version
But the Abatayos’ neighbors who were around during the shooting dismissed the policemen’s claim and said that no drug bust or chase happened.
“If it were true that the policemen and the suspects were grappling for the firearm, there should have been a commotion in the area. But there was none. It was very peaceful. What we saw was a policeman running behind Gwynn as she carried her blood-drenched child,” said a resident who sold banana cue near the Abatayos’ house.
A footage from Barangay Ermita’s closed-circuit television (CCTV) unit near the scene of the crime showed a policeman in civilian clothes carrying the child.
The neighbors believed that the policeman’s gun accidentally fired when he slipped and fell in the abandoned house.
A hole on the wooden wall of the room—left by the bullet that hit Skyler in the chest—was found about a foot from the floor of the second level of the house.
‘Hustisya’
Enraged residents of Sitio Bato are demanding justice for  Skyler’s senseless death.


On Wednesday, when the child’s coffin arrived in their sitio at 2 a.m., the residents lit candles on the road leading to the family’s home and chanted “hustisya” (justice) in unison.
They also initiated a signature campaign to urge the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7) to investigate the incident.
In their petition, the residents pointed out that the police also needed to ensure public safety during the conduct of peace-and-order operations.
A team of CHR-7 investigators submitted its initial report on Skyler’s death to the central office in Manila on Thursday.
“There were significant and material inconsistencies found by the probe team based on the public statements released by the police and the statements released by the witnesses. We will look into this during the formal hearing, which the CHR will set soon,” said lawyer Arvin Odron, director of CHR Central Visayas.
Members of the CHR Quick Reaction Team visited Sitio Bato on Wednesday and conducted forensic examination of the scene of the crime.
4 cops relieved
Odron said they would also subpoena Escober’s four men, all operatives of the Cebu City Police Station 5’s drug enforcement unit, to shed light on the shooting.
Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde had already ordered the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7) to relieve the four policemen.
Albayalde also assured Skyler’s family that “an impartial investigation by the PNP Internal Affairs Service is now being conducted in order to get to the bottom of this unfortunate incident.”


Although the four policemen tested negative for powder burns during a paraffin test, Albayalde said they were not yet off the hook.
Skyler’s mom Gwynn said she was not contented that the policemen had been relieved. The police, she said, should tell them what really happened.
Pa now tagged
The Abatayo couple also raised concern for their safety after Police Station 5 in Carbon belatedly tagged Marc Anthony as a drug personality.
Police said Marc Anthony was actually one of the four men who were having a pot session in the abandoned house raided by the policemen.
Marc Anthony said he feared that the police would use the allegations against him to force them to stop pursuing the case against his son’s killer.
“I’m afraid that they would use this drug allegation to eliminate me and make it appear that my son is the collateral damage for my wrongdoings,” Marc Anthony told Cebu Daily News on Friday.
“We only asked for justice for my son. Why do they have to make up stories about me?” he said.
NBI steps in
Marc Anthony insisted that he was neither a drug user nor a pusher despite residing in an area that police consider as a drop-off point for drugs. He said the barangay’s CCTV footage would prove that he was not in the area when the shooting occurred.


The footage showed that Marc Anthony left their house in his motorcycle at 12:15 p.m. Another footage showed him driving toward Panganiban Street in the barangay at 12:19 p.m.
Wary of the efforts of the city police to investigate the shooting, the Abatayo couple have already asked the National Bureau of Investigation to handle the case.
NBI agents visited the scene of the crime on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning to interview the neighbors and review the CCTV footage.

The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency list of “narcopoliticians” has been trimmed to 87 from 96 by the killing last week of a mayor and the removal from the roll of people who have left public office or died, the PDEA said on Wednesday.
Mayor Antonio Halili of Tanauan City, Batangas province, was killed by a sniper on July 2. He was on the narcolist, according to PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino.

Mayor Ferdinand Bote of General Tinio, Nueva Ecija province, and Vice Mayor Alexander Lubigan of Trece Martires, Cavite province, were also slain in brazen assaults last week, but Aquino said they were not on the narcolist.

The list includes 67 mayors and seven congressmen.
Passing blame on gov’t 
Aquino told a news briefing that the killings of Bote and Lubigan were likely carried out by people “taking advantage” of the slaying of Halili to pass the blame on the government.
President Rodrigo Duterte has faced criticism from local and international human rights groups for his take-no-prisoners war on drugs.
Thousands of small-time drug users and pushers have been killed by police and unknown assailants since he launched the crackdown after taking office in 2016.
Later that year, Mr. Duterte disclosed a list of politicians allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade. Two mayors on that list had been killed in police raids and one had fled the country.
Last week’s killings drove  the country’s mayors and vice mayors to seek an audience with Mr. Duterte, but no meeting had been set with the leader who promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals and dump their bodies in Manila Bay to fatten the fish.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Asked whether the narcopoliticians were being targeted, Aquino replied: “I don’t think so. Otherwise, if that were the case, then a lot [more people] would already be dead.”
Not state-sponsored killings
“These assassins who have been planning to kill these [local executives], they’re doing it right now because it will project as if it’s a state-sponsored killing… We will get blamed when, in fact, they’re just taking advantage of the situation to do it,” he said.
“Who have been killed who was on the narcolist? It’s only Halili.  The other two—Bote and Lubigan—what’s surfacing is that they were politically motivated killings,” he said.
Police earlier said that investigators were looking at politics as a possible motive for the attack on Lubigan, as the vice mayor told people close to him the day before he was killed that he planned to run for mayor in next year’s midterm elections.
Investigators said business could be a motive for the killing on Bote, although they were not ruling out politics in the attack on the mayor.
Despite protest from Halili’s family, Aquino maintained that the PDEA based its findings on “a four-agency task force validating the real [situation] on the ground.”
The agencies, he said, are the PDEA, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines and National Intelligence Coordinating Agency.
Information on Halili
“All have information on Mayor Halili,” he said.


“[Halili was] connected with a drug group. We are investigating it deeper, although we already have identities of that drug group. And there are some linkages also to some politicians in Central Luzon,” Aquino said.
Of the 87 remaining on the list of narcopoliticians, Aquino said the PDEA had already “revalidated” the involvement in drugs of three—two congressmen and a mayor. —WITH REPORTS FROM JULIA ORNEDO AND ANDREA ALCARAZ

The government’s gains in the war on drugs come up yet again, a year after the President in his second State of the Nation Address (Sona) vowed to wage an unrelenting fight against narcotics.
Thousands killed 
Data released by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in March showed that 4,075 “drug-linked” people had been killed while 91,704 operations against illegal drugs had been carried out since President Duterte assumed office at the end of June 2016.
The Philippine National Police and Malacañang acknowledge 4,354 killings from July 1, 2016, to June 30, much lower than the 12,000 estimated by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Researchers from Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University have counted 5,021 deaths from May 2016 to September 2017. They presented their research to the public on June 25.
But no matter how unrelenting the campaign is, the CHR said, the government would not find a solution unless it deals with the cause of the problem—poverty.
Accusations that state forces are responsible for the thousands of killings have weakened the government’s supposed gains in campaign, the CHR said.

“Allegations of extrajudicial killings puts into doubt the credibility of police operations and is exacerbated by extreme proposals such as those coming from PDEA, which seeks mandatory drug testing of children, negating the best interest of the child rule,” De Guia said.
The government has repeatedly denied extrajudicial killings in the war on drugs.
“[D]espite the significant gains, many side issues and, to some extent, deliberate disinformation, continue to obscure the true picture of our antidrug operations, often mislabeling the pure good intention of the campaign with human rights issues and political undertones,” Director General Oscar Albayalde, chief of the Philippine National Police, said in a news conference at Camp Crame in Quezon City in May.
Cops charged
In April, after the European Parliament criticized the brutal  crackdown on narcotics, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the government had filed charges against police officers involved in unlawful killings.
Roque said the filing of charges was proof that “impunity doesn’t have a place in our society.”
The CHR is handling 1,129 cases of alleged human rights abuses related to the drug war, involving 1,395 victims, its records showed.
Of those cases, 614 involve alleged abuses during police operations, while 511 are so-called vigilante killings, of which about 90 percent are being investigated by the CHR on its own initiative. The rest have been initiated through formal complaints.
Ninety-five percent of the cases handled by the CHR involve killings, De Guia said.
‘Unprecedented’ record


While previous administrations had their own share of human rights complaints, the Duterte administration’s record of killings is “unprecedented,” she said.
“The commission has been trying its best to attend to each and every case of extrajudicial killing, but we were confronted with the size and scale that we struggle to cope with,” she added.
The prevailing “climate of fear” has also hobbled the CHR’s investigation of the drug war killings, with witnesses refusing to come forward.
For the HRW, the Duterte administration’s drug campaign is a “bogus war that has caused immeasurable misery among mostly poor Filipinos.”
The group, too, said the government failed in its objective of reducing the effects of the illegal drug menace.
“If we measure it by the government’s stated purpose of reducing demand, it is not entirely clear. If the drug war really worked, one would think the streets would be clear of drugs by now. But no,” HRW researcher Carlos Conde said.
Many questions
With the drug problem persisting even after the killing of more than 12,000 people in the campaign, Filipinos find themselves confronted with many questions, the HRW said.
“Are those deaths a measure of the drug war’s effectiveness? Only if the Duterte government considers the poor the problem, which it apparently does,” Conde said.
The HRW said that while the body count had decreased, the government had continued its  “antipoor” campaigns, such as  rounding up loiterers, and attacks against journalists, human rights advocates and religious leaders who “check Duterte’s abuse of power.”


“As the Duterte government enters its third year, what becomes as important as the body count is accountability, which remains zero. In this sense, things have only gotten worse,” it said.
If the effectiveness of the war on drugs is to be gauged through figures, the findings of the Commission on Audit on the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) are telling.
In its 2017 audit report, the COA said the DILG failed to fulfill the objectives of its main program against illegal drugs, the  Mamamayang Ayaw sa Anomalya, Mamamayang Ayaw sa Droga (Masa Masid).
P500-M budget
Launched in 2017, the Masa Masid program, aimed at increasing public awareness of drugs and corruption and encouraging community participation in solving these problems, was given a budget of P500 million for that year.
The DILG directed local governments to employ certain strategies in the fight against drugs: Demand reduction through advocacy and education campaigns; demand and supply reduction through information gathering and reporting; and community-based rehabilitation programs.
The bulk of the budget, P380.232 million, or 76.05 percent, was distributed to various regional offices from June to December 2017 for the conduct of training programs, COA records showed.
But according to the COA, Masa Masid failed to achieve its objectives due to the slow or nonimplementation of programmed activities.
Unused funds amounting to P88.689 million were hurriedly transferred for use by other agencies, it added.
“Based on the foregoing [findings], the nonimplementation of programmed activities and nonutilization of program funds were indicative that [the DILG] had not prepared a concrete plan for Masa Masid, which resulted in the no-attainment of the program’s objective[s],” the COA said.

Arsenia Remedillo’s husband, Francisco, never smoked, drank or gambled.

In just two years, thousands have been killed in police operations and in attacks by motorcycle-riding gunmen. Most of the victims were from the poorest communities in Metro Manila.
Elusive justice 
The killings left thousands of grieving widows and orphans, for whom justice felt more and more elusive as months and years passed.
Despite her anger over her husband’s and her son’s deaths, Arsenia, 86, said seeking justice seemed futile.
“How can I get any justice? I have no idea who did this to them,” she said. “Maybe if I did, if I saw their faces, then I could go after them.”
But Remedillo did go after the killers. After Francisco and Marlon were shot, she ran after the gunman and was shocked to see five more masked men on motorbikes, acting as lookouts.
“I screamed at them and told them that I knew they were paid to kill,” she said. “But they just left.”

She was not afraid that the men would shoot her, too, she said. After all, they had already killed her family.
Mistaken identity
Remedillo said she knew that her adopted son used to take illegal drugs, influenced by his partner who had been jailed for peddling “shabu” (crystal meth).
Police records showed Marlon had on him two sachets of a substance believed to be shabu when he was killed.
“I knew he had already stopped using drugs. But my husband, he was mistaken for somebody else,” Remedillo said.
“I pray that my husband and my son watch over me. I leave their killers to God because there is nothing I can do now,” she said.
In 2016, Remedillo warned her husband not to vote for President Duterte “because you will die.”
Unheeded advice
She said she did not know why she had told him that, but something about the strongman from Davao City, who promised to fatten the fish in Manila Bay with the bodies of tens of thousands of drug users and peddlers, spooked her.
Francisco did not heed her advice. In May that year, he cast his vote for the President.


“My husband did not listen to me. Maybe if Duterte was not President, maybe he would still be alive,” Remedillo said.

SANTO NIÑO, South Cotabato — Two drug suspects were killed while another was arrested during law enforcement operations here on Saturday dawn, police said on Sunday.
Another drug suspect, a private school administrator and alleged drug user, escaped in a separate raid by police serving a search warrant in North Cotabato province.

Rasco said lawmen tried to present the warrant to the Cabantud brothers during an operation conducted past 2 a.m.
‘Nanlaban’ 
But two of the brothers “pulled handguns and fired at our troops that triggered a shootout,” Rasco said.
The brothers were initially wounded and rushed to a hospital in this town but were pronounced dead on arrival.
They were sons of incumbent village chair Bai Cabantud of Ambalgan village.
Recovered from the house of the Cabantuds were a .45-caliber pistol and one 9mm pistol with ammunition, nine sachets of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) and paraphernalia.
Rasco said the Cabantud brothers were on President Duterte’s drug list.

They were also on the list of high-value targets of the regional PDEA office, Rasco said.
Escaped
In a separate operation, also in the village of Ambalgan, police and PDEA agents were set to serve a search warrant on Moto, who was able to flee under cover of darkness as one of his companions traded shots with the law enforcement team.
Initially wounded during the gunfight was Ronnie Magon, described by police as a pusher working for Moto and also on Mr. Duterte’s drug list.
Police seized from him a homemade pistol and several sachets of crystal meth.
In yet another operation, Rasco said police were serving a search warrant on Lastimoso, who surrendered.
School official
In Midsayap, North Cotabato, police arrested the administrator of the school Great and Mighty Learning Center of Midsayap Inc. during the serving of a search warrant in relation to Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.
Rasco identified the suspect as Julius Caesar Dadiro Duque, who was arrested at 7 p.m. on Saturday inside the school compound in the village of Poblacion 4.
Recovered from Duque were four sachets of crystal meth and 48 empty sachets with meth residue.


Duque is now detained at the Midsayap police jail.
In earlier operations, nearly 40 people were arrested in separate operations throughout Southern Mindanao, according to police.
Drug den
The most arrests were made in Davao Oriental province, where at least 32 persons were caught in the act of using drugs at a den in the village of Central in Mati City.
In Davao City, P15,000 worth of crystal meth was seized from two suspects—Ariel Buhisan, 28, and Johndee Fred Pandili, 35—during a buy-bust operation in the village of 76-A, according to Chief Insp. Milgrace Driz, Southern Mindanao police spokesperson.
A report from the Davao Oriental police said a team of policemen, antinarcotics agents, soldiers and Coast Guard personnel swooped down on a community in the village of Central in Mati City to serve a search warrant on brothers Ricky and Raymond Matundo.
The two were arrested after the raiding team found in their house several sachets of crystal meth and unlicensed handguns.
Also arrested were at least 30 other persons near the house, which police said operated as a drug den.
In Tagum City, police also arrested four suspects during a raid in the village of Madaum. —With a report from Frinston Lim

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1012901/nanlaban-victims-unfazed-by-legal-hurdles,‘Nanlaban’ victims unfazed by legal hurdles,,"(Last of three parts)
In the back alleys of poor communities where the war on drugs is waged the fiercest, “nanlaban” bears a grim weight.
ADVERTISEMENT









It’s an official claim that the victim “resisted arrest” and engaged the police in a shootout. It’s a claim applied to thousands killed in the war, and whose families are hard-pressed to file charges.
But when Darwin Hamoy, 17, was killed along with three men in a purported buy-bust operation on Aug. 15, 2016, his mother, Mariza, and two other women took Batasan policemen to court.FEATURED STORIES
The suit is considered the first among the rare acts of defiance against this state-sponsored narrative.
Crucial to Mariza Hamoy’s fight and that of many others like her is the commitment of the legal community, which has been guiding the victims’ families in exploring legal options.


Whether the families choose to seek future reparation or to file suit, lawyers are helping them realize that “nanlaban” does not necessarily equate to helplessness.
Uphill battle
Using the money she pooled from mourners and gamblers at her son’s wake, Hamoy and two other women filed murder charges in the Office of the Ombudsman against 15 Station 6 policemen in September 2016.
Their commander, Supt. Leo Patay, is the alleged leader of the “Davao Boys.”
But on June 12, two years after they filed the case, Hamoy found herself abandoned by her two cocomplainants.
ADVERTISEMENT






One, Kathrina Polo, the lone eyewitness to the crime, filed an affidavit of desistance claiming that her husband, Cherwen, and the four others killed in the operation had shot it out with police.
Polo also denied being present when the killings occurred in her own house, and said the media had forced her to lie about the incident.
The third complainant, Marilyn Bordeos, refused to cooperate as well. Now only Hamoy’s case stands against the Station 6 cops.
“I was angry. When I saw them again, I couldn’t even speak. I just knew they had switched sides,” Hamoy says, “Win or lose, I’ll continue the case. You will never hear me giving up on it, even if I have to fight on my own.”
Hamoy’s case is now being handled by private firms Lente and Artikulo Tres, among the law groups that took up the challenge of helping the drug war survivors.
“The times are extraordinary so we need to respond,” says Lente director May Butoy.
“The demand of the times is for us to document [these cases] so [the survivors] can seek accountability later on.”
PURSUIT OF JUSTICE Mariza Hamoy, 44, is one of the three women who have filed murder raps against several Batasan policemen over their involvement in the death of her 17-year-old son, Darwin,whose photos she holds, in a buy-bust in August 2016. She insists that Darwin did not have a gun and that he was only buying cigarettes for one of the other victims, William Bordios,when he was shot. —KRIXIA SUBINGSUBING
In the two years since President Rodrigo Duterte declared his war on drugs, human rights groups estimate the death toll to be around 23,000 — mostly poor male breadwinners who were simply suspected of involvement in illegal drugs.
The impunity with which these extrajudicial killings (EJKs) are happening has led to a climate of fear, with most survivors refusing to press charges for fear of retribution.
The experience of “Lita,” who sought protection from the Diocese of Kalookan after her son, “Jose,” was shot dead by Caloocan police on Oct. 27, 2016, is illustrative. Four armed men had barged into the family home and even told Jose’s mother-in-law and child: Go upstairs, this won’t take long.
Jose was shot multiple times. But according to Lita, the police report stated that he had shot at the police during a buy-bust.


“I wanted to say, Why is your report like this? But police were everywhere. I was suddenly afraid they would shoot me on the spot,” Lita says. She has yet to press charges.
As early as 2016, with even the essential act of reporting a killing to authorities compromised, the Commission on Human Rights formed a network of eight law groups, including Lente, Artikulo Tres, Ateneo Human Rights Center, FLAG and CenterLaw, to focus on exploring legal remedies for EJK survivors.
With limited resources, the network began case management efforts in February 2017: processing affidavits, gathering evidence, conducting interviews with survivors and witnesses, and finding lawyers to handle the cases.
The network has identified three stages of human rights violations (HRVs) made in the context of the war on drugs: unsubstantiated drug watch lists, illegal arrests and EJKs.
The HRV cases also seemed to have a nexus with the evolution of the drug war, according to a member of a legal rights group in Quezon City.
At the start of the President’s term, when the antidrug campaign enjoyed immense popularity, most of the killings documented by the group occurred during police operations.
As the drug war came under scrutiny for alleged abuses, eventually the cases involved killings perpetrated by “masked vigilantes” or simple warrantless arrests, the lawyer says.
Most of the cases were based on hearsay, with little or no hard evidence and witnesses. Thus, lawyers willing to take on drug-related cases were few, making the filing of suits difficult.
What the network advocates instead is transitional justice. In partnership with the social ministry of parishes and other religious communities, this legal option involves future reckoning for survivors through the costing of reparations.
“The environment is not right to seek [the prosecution of suspects]. That’s how we see it now,” Lente’s Butoy says. “But the beauty of transitional justice is you’re looking not just at the victims but also at the families they left behind.”


Under this framework, legal groups document both the killing and the damage done in the aftermath: Did the children stop going to school? Did the mother suffer from depression? These constitute harm unrelated to the crime but worth some form of compensation under a reparations board, says Lente executive director Ona Caritos.
In the interim, the network seeks to provide for the families’ urgent needs, such as livelihood, scholarship and financial assistance.
For it to work, the lawyers must temper the survivors’ expectations while ultimately giving them the power to choose to demand prosecution now or in the future.
But prosecution is not an impossible choice, says Gil Aquino of CenterLaw, which led the two high-profile “Tokhang” cases in Payatas, Quezon City, and San Andres Bukid, Manila.
Both cases won landmark rulings in favor of the survivors and are considered “blueprints” of how drug-related cases should be handled.
It’s called strategic litigation: filing representative cases, though few, that “can bring results . . . [to] show that the justice system can work, and that there are victims who have some sense of justice,” Aquino says.
Championing the strongest cases can win precedence that will hopefully reverberate even to the low-profile cases, he adds. This can also encourage survivors like “Mercy” to file suit against police, as she did in March 2017 in the Office of the Ombudsman.
Assisted by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, Mercy brought murder charges against eight Caloocan cops accused of killing her husband and son inside their home at Barangay Bagong Barrio.
Despite her slim chances, she is “determined to make them feel that small people like us can still fight for our rights, that they can’t just take our lives away.”
“That’s representative justice,” Aquino says. “It gives people the idea that [you] just have to keep at it, because eventually there will be justice. But [you] have to ensure that cases are continuously being filed in the courts, to keep the policy in check.”
For the survivors to come forward, the legal community must have their back.


But most lawyers do not take up these cases because of fear of being tagged as drug protectors, conflicts of interest, or just “not feeling competent enough,” says June Ambrosio of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
She adds that the drug war has also led to sweeping changes in prosecuting drug cases under this administration. Gathering evidence for case buildup, for example, has become difficult.
The upsurge of drug cases and slim chances of prosecution have resulted in families likely to settle at the prosecutor’s level.
It doesn’t help that lawyers perceived as going against the government have become targets for harassment or even death threats, Aquino says.
“We can definitely do more [for the survivors],” says Ambrosio. “But we need to empower lawyers, capacitate them, . . . get [them] to step up and take a more proactive role in what’s happening.”
But every effort counts, and lawyers who are at the frontline need all the help they can get.

Paras’ seemingly paradoxical backing echoes that of millions of Filipinos, who polls say support the crackdown but not the thousands of slayings that are central to it.
The President’s drug war — his signature initiative — helped bring him to power in mid-2016, promising to rid society of narcotics by any means necessary. 
Since then, the Philippine National Police says officers has killed 4,854 alleged drug users or dealers in self-defense, while rights groups estimate the true toll is at least triple that.
According to the latest survey by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS), the campaign still has the backing of 78 percent of Filipinos, a figure undented in over a year.
Drug war proponents regularly point to these statistics as proof that the internationally condemned crackdown is the will of the people.
But those same polls show near unanimous agreement — 96 percent — among the nation in opposition to the killing, saying the suspects should be taken alive.
Backing turns into tragedy
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Experts say the President’s campaign has tapped into genuine popular outrage over disorder, crime and dysfunction in a developing nation with millions of poor people and a turbulent political past.
“It’s not like they’re turning a blind eye [to the killing] but they’re really worried about the drug problem,” said Steven Rood, a fellow in residence at SWS.
“It has been a problem for a long time and finally the President of the Philippines is doing something about it,” Rood added, describing how many Filipinos view the narcotics issue.
But for the family of Duterte voter Katherine Bautista, that belief was suddenly turned on its head by tragedy last year.
Bautista supported the crackdown until her stepson, John Jezreel David, was shot dead in what police said was an antidrug operation although she insisted John was not a drug user.
“I was even saying that the tears of families [of those killed] seemed fake. But when it happened to us, I felt the pain they were feeling,” Bautista told AFP.
“If it doesn’t happen to your family, you won’t wake up to the truth,” she added.
Lethal methods
A significant strand in the opposition to the killings is the fear a loved one could be slain just by being in the wrong place, not necessarily because of involvement in drugs.
“People feel very afraid that their families or their relatives might be placed in a situation where they could be the targets,” Randy David, a sociologist and a columnist for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, told AFP.


“But how can you possibly disagree or not lend support for a campaign to rid this country of illegal drugs?” David added, saying the lethal methods were what prompted questions.
There has been broader condemnation of the crackdown at home and abroad.
Rare protests were held in the Philippines last year following the deaths of teenagers, while outrage over alleged abuses has prompted the Preisdent to twice remove police from the front lines of the campaign — only to reinstate them, and promise to pardon officers convicted of murder.
The International Criminal Court has launched a preliminary examination into the killings, while rights groups say the President may be overseeing a crime against humanity.
‘My only sin’
Meanwhile, the President hammers the menace posed by drugs in near daily speeches in which he has described addicts as “not human.”
Analysts say the President uses clear and repeated messaging in an effort to buttress backing for his campaign.
“The way [the message] is delivered is that there is a very big threat, so first there’s the production of massive fear,” said Ateneo de Manila University psychology professor Cristina Montiel.
“Then [comes] the salvific message that this program or this leader is here to save you,” Montiel added. “That’s how popular support is produced.”
As the campaign continues, the death toll is well over Amnesty International’s count of 3,240 people killed during the nine years of martial law rule under dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the country’s darkest chapter since World War II.


The President recently addressed the thorny issue of the killings, delivering what critics called a clear admission they were suspect.
“What are my sins? Did I steal money? Even just P1? Did I prosecute somebody I sent to jail?” he asked in a speech in September. “My only sin is extrajudicial killings.”

Links to illegal activities
Before his retirement from the service in 2015, Sangco was linked to extortion and gun-running activities although Poklay said he did not know if the suspect had been charged in court. 
PDEA spokesperson Derrick Carreon identified Sangco as one of the high-value targets on President Duterte’s national watch list for suspected drug personalities.
According to the police report, Sangco pulled out a 9mm pistol after he “sensed” that he was transacting with a PDEA agent.
But he was not able to fire his gun because the agent shot him first.
Recovered from the scene were the suspect’s gun and at least 30 grams of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth).
On Sunday, a retired policeman, Supt. Roberto Palisoc, was shot dead inside a pedicab by unidentified motorcycle-riding gunmen in Malate, Manila.

Authorities said Palisoc, who was then with the Manila Police District Station 7’s antinarcotics division, opted for early retirement after his name appeared in the President’s “narco list” with other policemen, soldiers, politicians and judges in August 2016.
3rd kill in 2 days
Also on Sunday, SPO2 Rodolfo Cruz, another Manila policeman assigned at the special operations unit, was gunned down as he was leaving a cockpit arena at Barangay Dampalit in Malabon City.
It was unclear, however, whether Cruz had links to the drug trade, Malabon policemen said.
Sangco’s death came after the President’s warnings to have scalawag policemen, particularly those involved in drugs, “terminated,” saying he would not hesitate to make them his “project.”
“You can be very sure there will be a project for you and that is to neutralize or terminate you. If I would not do that, nothing will happen [in] this country if we are all bombarded (by) drugs, nobody (obeying) the law,” he said in a speech on July 31.

President Rodrigo Duterte drew harsh criticisms from a bishop, a senator and rights groups for separating human rights from people’s lives in his third State of the Nation Address (Sona), as he vowed to pursue a “relentless and chilling” war on drugs.
But another senator lauded the President for vowing to continue the antidrug campaign.

Reacting to the President’s statement that “your concern is human rights, mine is human lives,” which he directed at human rights groups, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David said it “implies that the victims of drug-related killings are not human lives!”
“Is not the right to life the most basic human right?” David asked in a Facebook post late Monday night.FEATURED STORIES

David, vice president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, said the President’s statement was “illogical” but not really surprising.
‘Focus on big suppliers’ 
Unlike David, Sen. Panfilo Lacson, chair of the Senate public order committee, was happy to hear that the President “is not relenting on the government’s war against illegal drugs.”
“Indeed, so much has yet to be accomplished, particularly its focus on big-time drug lords. It’s even reassuring that it remains on top of his agenda for the succeeding years of his presidency,” Lacson said.
David said the government should focus its fight against illegal drugs on big suppliers rather than on drug users.
“How come the supply of illegal drugs remains steady in spite of all the killings?” he said.
Sen. Francis Pangilinan said the antidrug campaign would not succeed as long as it kept on focusing on the killing of small fry and not on catching suppliers.

The President need not look far to see why this was not working, Pangilinan said.
The President’s own hometown continues to be plagued by illegal drugs, the senator added.
Scary
David said that while the President’s Sona was “relatively sober,” his warning that his drug war “will be as relentless and as chilling as on the day it began” was scary.
“It means we have to brace ourselves for more killings,” he lamented.
The Philippine National Police said 4,354 people had been killed in drug operations from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018, much lower than the 12,000 estimated by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW).
The PNP assured the public that there was no need to worry about the President’s statement on Monday on the drug campaign.
But HRW said respect for human rights and respect for human lives were not mutually exclusive.
“On the contrary, one reinforces the other,” said Carlos Conde, researcher of HRW’s Asia division.
Conde called out the President for “smearing” human rights defenders who were demanding that the government follow the rule of law.


‘Twisted logic’
In a statement, the rights advocacy group Karapatan said the President showed “twisted logic” in his Sona.
“Mr. Duterte is an insufferable psychopath who has developed a taste for killing poor people,” said Cristina Palabay, Karapatan secretary general.
Jose Maria Sison, founding chair of the Communist Party of the Philippines, called the President a “tyrant” when he declared that his bloody war on drugs would be relentless.
In a statement, Sison accused the President of promoting “the worst of criminality” among policemen, who are suspected of being behind the extrajudicial killings of drug suspects.
‘No distinction’
Lawyer Jacqueline de Guia, spokesperson for the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), said that while the agency was disappointed with the President’s vow to continue the brutal war on drugs, it lauded his focus on other aspects of life promoting human rights.
“We are supportive of all the rights he has urged Congress to advance while we remain steadfast that the campaign against drugs should not be at the expense of human lives,” said De Guia, chief of the CHR public affairs office.
The CHR cited the President’s pledge for government to give attention to other issues, including protection of migrant worker rights, the environment, peace, internal displacement, right to health and decent standard of living.
The President’s speech just demonstrated that there was no distinction between human rights and human lives, De Guia said in a statement. —REPORTS FROM TINA G. SANTOS, DJ YAP, LEILA SALAVERRIA, AIE BALAGTAS SEE, JEANNETTE I. ANDRADE, MELVIN GASCON, JAYMEE T. GAMIL AND DELFIN T. MALLARI JR.

Teenage victim Kian Loyd delos Santos’ last cry for help should serve as a constant call for justice on behalf of all victims of human rights abuses in the government’s war on drugs, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said on Friday.

She cited the results of an investigation by a CHR team which found out that contrary to police claims, Delos Santos, a 17-year old Grade 11 student, was actually pleading for mercy as he was picked up by policemen from his house in Caloocan City on Aug. 16 last year.
“Please stop it, sir. I have an exam tomorrow,” he was reported as telling his captors, as quoted from a CHR investigation report. 
De Guia expressed disgust that Delos Santos was killed by “police officers who [were] supposed to be the protectors of the people.”
“We owe it to the youth, especially to the innocent lives lost in the anti-drug operations, to fight for a society free of violence and abuse and one that truly upholds the dignity and rights of all,” she said.
Selective justice
While criminal and administrative cases had been filed against three police officers, others were not held to account. “Worse, [they were even] promoted,” she said.
De Guia called on the PNP leadership to ensure that they would bring to the fold of justice law enforcers who were involved in drug-related killings.

Meanwhile, the bodies of two men were found in Navotas around 5 a.m. of Nov. 5 — one along R10 and the other on Tanigue Street under the Sawata Bridge.
“Both had single (gunshot wounds) in the head, strangulation marks on their necks and cuff marks on their wrists,” David said. “One of them was later identified as Jimboy Opriasa, 35 years old, a resident of Gensan Street. Sangandaan, Caloocan. The other was Jovito Marquez Jr.,  23 years old, a resident of Malaya Street, Balut, Tondo.” 
Around 5 a.m. of Nov. 6, Rodel Manlapaz, 18, was shot and killed by unknown assailants at Letre, Malabon. Another man was wounded in the attack and was brought to the hospital.
Four attacks took place in Navotas in a span of two days.
On Nov. 9, Teofilo Francisco Jr., 33, was shot dead on Ablola Street, Tangos, Navotas. Gunmen also shot and killed Rannie Boy Barrot, 36, in an alley near Pescador II Street, near the NBBS Barangay Hall, later that day.
On Nov. 10, around 2 a.m., Ricardo Domingo, 32, was shot and killed on Bagong Kalsada, also in Tangos. Hours later, Christopher Boljoran, 24, was abducted on Champaca Street and then killed in a spot just outside the city’s fish port.
The bishop also said the family of Reymond Cerbito of Poblacion, Sta. Maria in Bulacan province, had sought the assistance of the diocese in locating the man, who went missing in April. At one point, he said, Cerbito’s loved ones looked for him in a morgue in Longos, Malabon.

David was one of the first Church leaders to strongly denounce the spate of killings of so-called drug personalities, almost all from the urban poor, either in police operations and vigilante-style attacks which critics say President Duterte has been encouraging since he assumed power in mid-2016.
In September, a Social Weather Stations survey showed that  8 out of 10 or 78 percent of Filipinos are satisfied with the administration’s campaign against narcotics.

ZAMBOANGA CITY — A police superintendent on President Rodrigo Duterte’s “narcolist” was killed in a shootout with law enforcers in a buy-bust operation in Dipolog City on Monday night, as the Philippine National Police regional office pressed its campaign to rid its ranks of officers with drug links.
Chief Insp. Helen Galvez, spokesperson for the police regional office here, identified the slain officer on Tuesday as Supt. Santiago Ylanan Rapiz, logistics chief of the Zamboanga del Norte police.

Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat, chief of the PNP Counter-Intelligence Task Force (CITF), which operates against rogue officers, said Rapiz was on a list of 6,000 suspected drug dealers compiled for the President’s war on drugs.
Rapiz was accused of protecting drug lords and engaging in narcotics dealing, Caramat said.FEATURED STORIES

Reward for police team
The President on Tuesday promised to reward the policemen who killed Rapiz with a trip to Hong Kong. 
He said he was open to converting the trip to cash.
Noting that Rapiz was a ranking officer, the President promised to reward policemen who would kill their superiors who were involved in the illegal drug trade.
He also reminded policemen that there was a P3-million reward for officers who could kill “ninja cops” — officers who sell confiscated illegal drugs.
Rapiz was selling P50,000 worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) to undercover agents from the CITF and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in Dipolog City on Monday night when he sensed that he had been caught in a buy-bust operation.
Galvez said Rapiz tried to escape, but he was cornered in front of the Andres Bonifacio College gym.

Shootout
“Instead of [surrendering], he drew his firearm and fired at the arresting [officers]. The [authorities] fired back, hitting him,” Galvez said.
Recovered from Rapiz was a plastic packet containing the shabu that he had tried to sell to the agents and a semiautomatic pistol.
He was taken to Corazon Aquino Hospital in Dipolog, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, Galvez said.
Chief Supt. Emmanuel Luis Licup, the PNP regional director, said Rapiz worked at the Western Visayas Police Office in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental province, before he was reassigned here in October 2016.
Crackdown on bad cops
Earlier, Licup announced an intensification of a campaign against police in the region with drug links.
He said 11 officers had been arrested in drug raids, while 31 others had tested positive for drugs.
Rapiz was the third policeman to be killed in the campaign.
Two other officers — PO3 Ronald Bernardo and PO2 Ma. Oliver Olaso, both members of the narcotics team of the Zamboanga City police — were killed in a shootout with undercover agents during a drug raid on Aug. 18.


Nearly 5,000 people have been killed in police operations since the President launched his brutal war on drugs in 2016.
Human rights groups claim the actual score is five times that figure and that the victims were mostly small-time drug users or peddlers gunned down by motorcycle-riding assailants, who are either hired guns working for the police or policemen themselves.
The PNP rejects that charge, saying the other killings were “deaths under investigation.” —With reports from Julie M. Aurelio and the wires

Their families claimed that their loved ones were victims of extrajudicial killings.
Pattern 
“Is it natural for a person who was alone, armed only with a ‘paltik’ (homemade gun) to shoot it out with several policemen armed with better firearms?” Zabella said.
“Without prejudging any investigation on the cases, it can be readily seen that there is that pattern similar to other situations involving arrests of drug suspects,” Zabella added.
But Supt. Reydante Ariza, Lucena City police chief, dismissed accusations of wrongdoing against local policemen.
“Their words against our words,” he said.
Councilor Rey Oliver Alejandrino urged police officers to submit to an independent investigation.

“Whether or not the victims resisted arrest and they were first to fire at policemen, the fact remained that they were killed by a superior force,” Alejandrino, a human rights lawyer, said in a separate statement.
Records of the Lucena police showed that five suspected drug pushers were slain in buy-bust operations in 2016, two in 2017, and 24 from January to the second week of November this year.
Same story
From Nov. 5 to 12, four men who had surrendered to authorities following the release of a government drug watch list were killed in police operations.
They were Roldan Laviña, 32, of Barangay Kanlurang Mayao (Nov. 12); Edilberto Jubac Jr., 33, of Ibabang Dupay (Nov. 8); Neil Arangoste, 28, of Dalahican (Nov. 7); and Ramil Moreno, 49, also of Dalahican (Nov. 5).
Police reports on these incidents carried the same story: “… instead of heeding the arresting officer, the suspect suddenly drew his revolver and fired [at] the poseur-buyer but missed, forcing the backup operative to retaliate resulting [in] the death of the suspect.”
Investigators, according to these reports, recovered .38-caliber revolvers, bullet casings, marked money supposedly used in drug transactions, and sachets of “shabu” (crystal meth) from the slain men.
‘Legitimate’
Geraldine, Moreno’s wife, said her husband, a fisherman, was killed in front of their house.
“When I saw him still gasping, I pleaded with the policeman to help me bring him to the hospital. But instead, one of them … shot him one more time and finished him off,” she said.


Arangoste was slain in his mother’s house by armed men who she presumed to be policemen in street clothes.
Ariza maintained that these police operations were “legitimate,” noting that the slain men, who he said were drug pushers, resisted arrest and tried to kill policemen.
Ariza said all information concerning activities of drug suspects were provided by barangay officials. “We don’t know the targets. But we were told that they were all armed and dangerous,” he said.

Hamoy was killed with Cherwen Polo, William Bordeos, Sherwin Ternal and a certain “Rambo” in an Aug. 15, 2016, drug raid by the Station 6 policemen on the Polos’ house in the village of Payatas B. 
In September that year, their relatives—widows, Katrina Polo and Marlyn Bordeos, and mother Mariza Hamoy—challenged police claims before the PNP-IAS and the Office of the Ombudsman that the five victims had engaged police in a gunfight.
The women claimed that the five victims were at the Polos’ house to celebrate Cherwen’s birthday and that they were summarily executed by the team led by Pinero.
In a 10-page report approved on Oct. 17, the IAS said Hamoy’s “detailed narration of facts and circumstances, duly corroborated by Polo and Bordeos, is more convincing than the alibis of the policemen.”
Body in sack
This was a complete turnaround from a July 12 resolution from the Office of the Ombudsman, which ruled that the women’s testimonies “do not deserve credence,” since they were not present during the deadly police operation.

But the IAS ruled that there was sufficient evidence of treachery, which qualified the crime as murder.
It cited a forensic report on Hamoy, which found that he was shot in the lungs, as proof of the “gruesome and merciless killing.”
What the policemen did, the IAS resolution said, was “a clear transgression of established rules.”
It also held them accountable for placing Hamoy’s body in a sack and transporting it to Quezon City General Hospital, instead of letting forensics examiners process the crime scene.
“There is no doubt that they violated the norms of public service,” the IAS report said.
Command responsibility
The IAS also found Patay liable for command responsibility for letting Pinero, an SPO1, to lead the raid.
He was also taken to task for failing to punish his men.
Mariza, Hamoy’s mother, said she was not expecting the IAS to side with her.
“I feel stronger and more confident that this case would stand, and I could finally attain justice for my son,” she said.


Pinero, Pal, Timon, Maderable, Banggat and Molinos—all antidrug operatives—were named in a Pulitzer-winning Reuters report as members of the “Davao Boys,” a supposedly handpicked group of deadly operatives.
Patay, now Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief for Central Visayas, was their alleged leader.

SAN PEDRO CITY — A new round of simultaneous police operations left 11 people, most of them suspected to be involved in the illegal drug trade, dead over the last 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday in Laguna province.
But Senior Supt. Eleazar Matta, Laguna police director, said the number of fatalities was insignificant compared to the 187 people arrested for various offenses during the same period.

“We’ve proven the Sacleo (Simultaneous Anti-Criminality Law Enforcement) effective so we’d keep implementing it here,” Matta told the Inquirer by telephone on Tuesday.

Sacleo was a police campaign that replaced “Oplan Galugad” (search) and “One Time-Big Time” operations. Police carry out buy-bust operations and serve search and arrest warrants simultaneously across the province.
Earlier this month, 12 crime suspects were also killed in Laguna during a 24-hour operation. 
The campaign had reduced by half the province’s weekly crime volume to only 10 as recorded last week, Matta said.
“From an average of 20 to 25, we recorded only 10 last week. That’s an all-time low for Laguna,” he said.
Police reports showed that three drug suspects were killed in two separate buy-bust operations at Barangay Canlalay and Sto. Niño in Biñan City at 1:30 a.m. and 3:15 a.m. on Tuesday, respectively.
Also on Tuesday in Lumban town, a suspect, Francisco Padua alias Kid, was killed in a drug bust shortly after midnight at Barangay Balimbingan.
Padua was on the police watch list for suspected drug users. Recovered from him was a .38-caliber gun, police said.

Matta said all suspects died in “legitimate operations.”
In Kalayaan town, a suspect, identified only as Mike, was killed at 10:45 p.m. on Monday at Barangay Longos. The suspect reportedly shot an undercover agent, PO1 Mark Anthony Espiritu, when he realized it was a sting operation.
In Cavinti town, a suspect, identified only as Edwin, was killed in a buy-bust operation on the national highway at Barangay Lumot at 10:50 p.m. on Monday.
Edwin was accused of selling “shabu” (crystal meth) to residents in Barangay Lumot, West Talaongan and East Talaongan.
Drug delivery
In this city, a jeepney driver, Rodante Aragao, was killed in a drug bust at Barangay Landayan on Monday morning.
Supt. Giovannie Martinez, San Pedro police chief, said Aragao delivered drugs here during his trips from Pasay City in Metro Manila.
In Calamba City, Raul Alex was killed in a drug bust at Barangay San Cristobal at 2:30 a.m. on Monday, while a suspect, Roberto Paredes, was killed at Barangay Pooc in Sta. Rosa City at 11 p.m. on Sunday. Paredes was also included in the police watch list for illegal drug pushers.
In Cabuyao City, two men were killed when the police acted on a tip on a group of robbery suspects at Barangay Mamatid on Monday morning.
When the policemen approached, the suspects allegedly opened fire, forcing the lawmen to shoot back and kill them. —Maricar Cinco

LUCENA CITY—At least 97 percent of 183 drug-related deaths being investigated by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) happened in police operations in the region since January, a CHR official said.
Records sent by lawyer Rexford Guevarra, CHR regional director, on Wednesday showed that from January to Nov. 15, 178 cases were reported during antidrug operations conducted by policemen. Suspects in the remaining cases were unidentified, records showed.

“The number of drug-related killings this year [increased by] more than 300 percent … compared to last year’s figure,” Guevarra said in a telephone interview.
In 2016, only 24 drug-related killings during police operations were reported in the region. This jumped to 57 deaths the following year.FEATURED STORIES

Guevarra said most of the victims resisted arrest and engaged policemen in shootouts.
Laguna posted the highest number of drug-related killings with 60 cases followed by Cavite with 51. Batangas had 32 while Rizal and Quezon had 20 each. 
Formal complaint
Supt. Chitadel Gaoiran, spokesperson for the Calabarzon police, said all cases were presumed to be “legitimate police operations.”
“If there is any formal complaint, the regional office is open to any investigation,” she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
Gaoiran said the Philippine National Police had several avenues, for instance through its Internal Affairs Services, to investigate suspected extrajudicial killings where policemen were allegedly involved.
In an earlier interview, Supt. Reydante Ariza, Lucena City police chief, dismissed accusations of wrongdoing against local policemen.

Ariza stood by their reports and the legitimacy of their drug operations.
He said they were ready to face all investigations to clear their names.
Summary execution
Guevarra said the total number of drug-related killings and suspected summary executions perpetrated by policemen could be more than what their data showed.
He said their records were based on information provided by complainants seeking their office’s help and those reported by the media.
“We’re facing challenges in our investigation because the police were not giving us their official reports. So, how can we determine if it’s really ‘nanlaban’ (a slain suspect resisting arrest) or not?” he said.
More deaths
In Quezon province, suspected drug pushers, Christopher Supremo and Hilario Torres, were killed in a drug bust at Barangay Market View in Lucena City on Tuesday.
Ariza said Torres, when he sensed that he was dealing with undercover policemen, drew his .38-caliber revolver but it jammed when he tried to shoot a policeman. Supremo also drew his .45-caliber pistol and shot the policeman but missed.
Another policeman fired at the suspects, killing them instantly.


On Sunday night, suspected drug pusher Rhoderick Hugo was killed in another antidrug operation at Barangay 5, also in Lucena, when he resisted arrest.
But one of Hugo’s relatives dismissed the police’s version of the operation.
The relative said Hugo was kneeling, with his hands on his head, and was pleading for his life before he was shot.
“But the armed man in civilian clothes still shot and killed him,” the relative said.
A neighbor and the victim’s relative admitted that Hugo was a drug user and a “runner.”
“He was being asked by drug users to buy ‘shabu’ (crystal meth) for them in exchange for P50 or P100. But he was not the pusher,” the neighbor said.
The three latest victims brought to seven the total number of suspected drug pushers slain in police operations in Lucena City this month.
Lawyer Rodolfo Zabella Jr., president of Integrated Bar of the Philippines in Quezon province, said members of the group would meet this week to discuss ways to help the families of of those killed in the government’s drug war and find the truth about the killings. —With a report from Maricar Cinco

The tricycle driver’s father, Nestor Piagola Sr., is serving his sentence at the New Bilibid Prison for a drug offense.
As to the motive for the killing, Pablito said: “We cannot say it’s drug-related deeper unless investigation is conducted. What I know is his father Nestor Sr. is in Muntinlupa. He was convicted of a crime related to RA 9165 [the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act].” 
“He is a good man,” a relative of the victim, who refused to be identified, told the INQUIRER in Hiligaynon. “As a matter of fact he finished his rehab.”
Piagola is the second person killed by a motorcycle-riding men in a week in this city.
Last Nov. 20, retired SPO2 Rolando Alag was killed by men on a violet Yamaha Mio motorcycle.
Recovered at the crime scene were five empty shells, possibly from a .45-caliber pistol.
Piagola died on the spot with several gunshot wounds in his head and body.

Pablito is planning to request the city government and Land Transportation Office here to tighten their rules on motorcycles running without plate numbers.
He said would be hard to identify the perpetrators because they were using unregistered motorcycles.
“I will coordinate with the city and LTO to tighten the implementation of possible no plate no travel in the city,” Pablito said. “I am also contemplating to push that every motorcycles must be registered with the police so that it will be easy for us to find possible motorcycle used once its color, model and design is identified.”
He said, however, that this plan would face some opposition. /atm

Catholic priests and outspoken critics of the antidrug campaign Albert Alejo, Flavie Villanueva and Robert Reyes celebrated a Mass that called for the “restoration of peace, justice and dignity of human lives.”

“A person who is killed is not a mere number or statistic. Killing a person means ending his and his children’s dreams, his capacity to love, create and contribute to society,” Alejo said.
The candles lit by the mothers, wives and children of EJK victims should remind the government of its failure to protect and care for the poor and the vulnerable, Reyes said.FEATURED STORIES

Villanueva, an advocate for the education and rehabilitation of suspected drug personalities, offered prayers to “end the violation of human dignity of every Filipino and the followers of Christ.”
The priests said they hoped that EJK victims will never be forgotten whatever their number—30,000 according to  civil society groups or 5,000 as claimed by the police. 
Pwersa ng Pamayanan para sa Voluntarismo at Reporma, one of the civic groups that joined the vigil, said the drug war had turned into an “antipoor policy” that gives women an added burden as some of them succumb to depression.
“I hope the killings would stop because even small children are suffering,” said the widow of drug suspect Rolando Ocampo who was shot with two others by police in Barangay 19 in Manila on Oct. 11, 2017.  The police said the men had fought it out, but CCTV footage in the neighborhood indicated that they were executed.
The widow said she now had to take care of their three young kids by herself.

De Chavez was shot dead in what police described as an “armed encounter.”
Analyn said she even heard the gunshots but thought these came from fireworks set off from the nearby University of the Philippines Los Baños campus. 
Buy bust
“People here knew my husband. He was very kind, didn’t have any enemy. Isusubo na lang n’ya, ibibigay pa (He would share whatever little he had),” she said.
De Chavez, 41, a native of Sariaya town in Quezon province, was killed in a buy-bust operation led by the police.
Witnesses, among them residents on their way to school or work as it happened around 8 a.m., said armed men, some with their faces covered, chased down De Chavez from a convenience store at Barangay Masaya to a more secluded area where the supposed shootout took place.
Police cars and some unmarked vehicles then arrived and blocked the road on both ends to secure the scene.

Analyn said it took the police’s forensics team two hours to come, her husband’s bullet-riddled body left out in the open.
“My daughter (who returned from school) and I were pleading that we take him to the hospital. He could still be alive then,” she said.
Police said they recovered a .45-caliber gun, P800 cash and a sachet of “shabu” (crystal meth) stashed in a tiny purse.
‘Hit man’
But police maintained it was a legitimate operation.
Senior Supt. Eleazar Matta, Laguna provincial police director, said De Chavez was a “hit man” affiliated with two groups — Bahay Kubo, or Bantugon gun-for-hire syndicate that operated in the provinces of Laguna, Batangas and Quezon, and the Jason Hernandez drug group.
De Chavez was also allegedly behind at least 27 paid hits, either against politicians or drug pushers.
Analyn, a housewife, kept mum about the family’s source of income but denied that her husband was into illegal drugs.
“They had taken my husband away, but what my children saw and the lies they heard about their father, that’s what made it a torture,” she said.

The CHR recorded at least 368 drug-related deaths in the region from 2016 to Jan. 15 this year.
Laguna leads the provinces with the most number of cases at 139. It was followed by Cavite with 77, Batangas, 56, Quezon, 50, and Rizal, 46. 
Records showed that 279 died in antidrug operations conducted by the police. Suspects in 24 of these cases had yet to be identified, the CHR said.
But police reports from Jan. 15 to Feb. 18 this year showed that at least 21 more suspected drug users and traders, including two Chinese, were killed in the government’s drug war.
During this period, Laguna recorded 11 victims, while Quezon had four and Batangas and Cavite, three each.
On Feb. 3, Vincent Du Lim and Hong Li Wen, both Chinese, were killed in a drug bust conducted by government agents at a suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) warehouse in Tanza town, Cavite.
‘Nanlaban’

Police reports had described most of the slain suspects as “nanlaban,” or those who fought back and engaged policemen in gunfights.
CHR data showed that 32 suspects were killed in the drug war in 2016, when President Duterte assumed office. The figure reached 61 in 2017 and rose to 263 in 2018.
The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency reported that 5,104 had died in antidrug operations from July 1, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2018, nationwide, but human rights groups disputed the figure, saying the death toll was higher.
In Quezon, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines’ provincial chapter earlier offered legal assistance to families of drug war victims who wanted to pursue cases against the police.
But lawyer Rodolfo Zabella Jr., IBP chapter president in the province, said no one had sought help from their group.
Losing interest
Most families of the more than 40 drug war victims in Lucena City were no longer interested in filing complaints out of fear of possible retaliation from the suspects.
“Only those few killings reported in the media had been resolved after their killers were punished. The death of my relative was just part of the growing list of victims of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration,” said an uncle of one of the victims.
“Honestly, we’re all afraid of the possible retaliation by the killers. We just leave everything to God,” he added.

REYES
MANILA, Philippines — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said she intended to wrap up next year the preliminary examination of the allegations of crimes against humanity that President Rodrigo Duterte committed in his war on drugs, a move welcomed by the complainants who it saw as a “glimmer of hope” that he would be held liable for the thousands killed.
In a 77-page report on Thursday that included the Philippine case, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she had looked into the complaints that Mr. Duterte and other senior government officials “actively promoted and encouraged the killing of suspected or purported drug users and/or dealers.”
ADVERTISEMENT







She said it was “in such context” that law enforcers and “unidentified assailants” had carried out thousands of killings throughout the country.
“During 2020, the Office (of the Prosecutor) will aim to finalize the preliminary examination in order to enable the prosecutor to reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines,” Bensouda said.FEATURED STORIES

Malacañang did not immediately respond to the Inquirer’s request for comment.
In a statement in February 2018, Bensouda emphasized that a preliminary examination was a process of examining available information to determine whether she should proceed with an investigation in accordance with the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC. 
A livid Mr. Duterte verbally attacked Bensouda and the ICC for acting on the complaint of crimes against humanity filed by lawyer Jude Josue Sabio in April 2017.
In August last year, a similar complaint was filed in the ICC by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) on behalf of the relatives of eight alleged victims of extrajudicial killings attributed to the President’s war on drugs.
“People are already inquiring and keenly awaiting an update on the case,” he added.
The Philippine National Police has reported that more than 6,600 have been killed since the antinarcotics campaign began on Mr. Duterte’s first day in office, but various local and international human rights groups say the death toll is in the tens of thousands.
For former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, one of the President’s arch critics, Bensouda’s report signaled that “justice is coming.”
ADVERTISEMENT
 


He urged PNP officers who carried out the drug killings to now decide “whether you would fall with Duterte on being liable for crimes against humanity or you would partly cleanse your crime by being a witness for the ICC prosecutors.”
“Now, let me point out the obvious,” he said. “As Duterte steps down from office in just a little over two years, he would not be able to protect you.”
“In fact, even Duterte won’t be able to protect himself,” Trillanes said.
Bensouda said the ICC “retains jurisdiction over alleged crimes that have occurred on the territory of the Philippines during the period when it was
a state party to the (Rome) Statute”— from Nov. 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, which was the day before the Duterte government withdrew from the treaty.
She noted that the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction was “not subject to any time limit,” or even if the country were “no longer a state party to the ICC.”
“It validates our view and repudiates the Duterte administration’s weak and erroneous position on the effectivity, jurisdiction and independence of the ICC on this matter as a parallel or alternative legal remedy when victims are running out of options to turn to,” Olalia said.
“Most importantly, it validates the fact that all these years, what we have endured are self-serving and self-righteous justifications for extrajudicial killings and other acts amounting to crimes against humanity,” he said.
The ICC prosecutor said her office used “open source information,” including news reports and official statements by the Philippine government,
in examining the actions of the President and other public officials.
“Open source information indicates that a limited number of investigations and prosecutions have been initiated (and, in some cases, completed) at the national level in respect of direct perpetrators of certain criminal conduct that allegedly took place in the context of, or connection to, the (drug war) campaign,” she said.
In assessing the complains, Bensouda said her office reached out to “relevant stakeholders” and met with members of civil society organizations.


“The office has also been following with concern reports of threats and other measures apparently taken against human rights defenders, including those who have criticized the [drug war],” she said.

Lt. Col. Lino Capellan, regional police spokesperson, said only 46 drug suspects were killed during police operations in 2019 compared to 154 slain in the previous year.

He attributed the decline to the “reduced number of drug
personalities who resisted arrest, or those who engaged police in a shootout.”
He also said the decline in number could indicate that “fewer people engaged in illegal drugs” amid the government’s aggressive anti-drug campaign.FEATURED STORIES

He claimed, however, that many of the 46 persons killed “resisted arrest.”
“No rubout, no extra-judicial killing, these were all legitimate law enforcement operations,” Capellan said on the number of people killed during police raids. 
He said police seized about P60.1 million worth of illegal drugs during the 1,528 operations conducted for the period.
A total of 7,887.26 grams of shabu and 5,615.05 grams of marijuana were recovered.
Brig. Gen. Alfred Corpus, PRO-12 regional director, also reported at least 60 illegal firearms and 17 explosives confiscated by the police last year.
Capellan also noted a 22-percent drop in the number of drug
personalities the police arrested during the period.
A total of 1,576 drug personalities were arrested in 2019 and
were eventually charged. He claimed that of those arrested, 1,141 were drug peddlers and 435 were users.

Gen. Debold Sinas, director of the National Capital Region Police Office (File Photo from NCRPO)
CEBU CITY, Philippines – The war on drugs in Central Visayas escalated when Major General Debold Sinas was its top policeman.
But his stint in the region was marred by the rise of unsolved killings of people linked to the illegal drugs trade, said lawyer Alvin Odron, director of the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7).

“He (Sinas) had a colorful stint here in the region. During his watch, the number of killings definitely increased,” he told the Inquirer over the phone.
Odron, however, was not able to provide the figures as his documents were left in his office. Sinas was director of the Central Visayas police from July 2018 to October 2019 before he was assigned at the National Capital Region Police Office.FEATURED STORIES

CHR-7 chief investigator Leo Villarino said Sinas would always be remembered as the police official who was firm in his decision not to give human rights investigators copies of police reports on the various killings in the region.
“While we appreciate his relentless campaign against illegal drugs in Central Visayas, there were just so many killings under his watch as police director here,” he said. 
“The CHR-7 is conducting an investigation on these killings although we failed to get the documents from the police,” he added.
Jaime Paglinawan of Bayan Muna Central Visayas described Sinas as a “severe human rights violator” when he was Central Visayas’ police director.
“Aside from several persons killed during his anti-drugs campaign, a number of farmers accused as members of the New People’s Army in Negros Oriental were also killed during his watch,” Paglinawan said.
“And his usual defense was these persons tried to shoot it out with the police. That’s how we remember him (Sinas),” he added.
Sinas had repeatedly explained that it was just normal for his men to protect themselves from unlawful aggression.

Soul mates
Their friends believed Charlie and her boyfriend, Airon Cruz, 28, were “soul mates” as both shared the same birthday, Sept. 30. The couple of no longer than 10 months died on the same day, in a shootout with policemen on Oct. 23. 
Police said Airon was the leader of a gun-for-hire group, responsible for killings in Cavite, among them the 2014 slaying of tabloid reporter Rubylita Garcia in Bacoor City.
Supt. Giovannie Martinez, city police chief, said a resident reported gun firing at Airon’s house at 4 a.m. When policemen arrived, Airon’s team allegedly fired at them, resulting in a shootout.
Girl’s plea
Aside from Airon, also killed was his brother, Arcy-Niño, 30. Their two other friends, Romeo “Jack” Bejerano, 28, and Jeffrey Dasig, 32, also died in the shootout.
Charlie had nine bullet wounds in the chest and buttocks. The four others had bullet wounds and bruises.

Police said Charlie held two grenades, but Liezel doubted this saying her daughter could not even hold a knife.
Based on their neighbors’ accounts, Liezel said Charlie was heard crying for help. “‘Tama na! Buntis ako’ (Enough! I’m pregnant,” their neighbors quoted Charlie as saying.
Airon and Arcy’s younger sister, Abigail, said neighbors also heard Charlie screaming: “‘Palabasin n’yo na lang ako’ (Just please let me leave).”
“Is this what you call ‘nanlaban’ (someone who fought back)? You see these jalousies? Not a single one of them was broken,” Abigail said.
CHR probe
Lawyer Jacqueline dela Peña, spokesperson for the Commission on Human Rights, said they dispatched on Wednesday a team to investigate the incident.
“We’d like to see if the police followed the manual of operations, the rules of engagement and if it were a reasonable, proportionate use of force,” she said.

Caloocan police officers blamed 17-year old Kian delos Santos for his death as well as the media and politicians for distorting the facts.
On Aug. 16, there were three other teenagers arrested besides Kian, according to separate counter-affidavits filed by Chief Insp. Amor Cerillo, commander of Police Community Precinct 7 in Caloocan City, and co-respondents PO3 Arnel G. Oares, PO1 Jeremias T. Pereda and PO1 Jerwin R. Cruz.

One of the teenagers, they said, was turned over to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), while the two others were turned over to barangay officials.
“Why is it important to mention about the three other minors arrested during ‘Oplan Galugad’ on Aug. 16, 2017?” the police officers said in their counter-affidavits. “It is very important to mention the three other minors because this proves that Kian Delos Santos is the fourth minor involved in ‘Oplan Galugad’ during that day and his death is an isolated case.”FEATURED STORIES

“Out of the four minors… it is only Kian Delos santos who ran away and worse engaged our police officers in a shootout,” read the counter-affidavits.
The police officers said the fact that three other minors were turned over to the DSWD and barangay officials showed that the officers involved in ‘Oplan Galugad’ were properly “educated and supervised.” 
The police officers are facing a complaint for murder and torture case. They attended Monday’s preliminary investigation and submitted their response to the murder and torture complaint.
They added that the media and the politicians blew the case out of proportion by twisting facts: “The media and the grandstanding politicians only twisted the incident involving Kian delos Santos by making it appear that there is a policy of killing in the PNP [Philippine National Police], but the truth is, there is none.”
“If only Kian Loyd delos Santos did not involve himself in the illegal drug activities, then he would not be involved in any ‘Oplan Galugad’ and he does not need to open fire at our patrolling police officers,” the counter-affidavit stated. “The problem is that the media and the grandstanding politicians pictured Kian delos Santos before the public as an innocent minor but the truth of the matter is that Kian Loyd Delos Santos is indeed a drug courier.”
According to the police officers, it is a fact that criminal syndicates use minors in perpetrating crimes.
They also maintained that it was an asset, not Kian, who was seen on a CCTV footage being dragged by the police officers.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


They added that the complainants had no eyewitness to the actual killing of Kian.
An autopsy report showed that Kian sustained gunshot wounds to the back, behind his left ear, and inside his left ear.
But the police officers said location of the wound did not indicate treachery.
“Jurisprudence states that there can be treachery also even when the wounds are at the front,” they said.
The police officers sought the dismissal of the case against them.
The next preliminary investigation dates are Oct. 2 and 10.

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO — Bishop Pablo Virgilio David said night prayers have become his ritual since October last year when the Duterte administration’s war on illegal drugs claimed more lives in the cities of Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas, all part of the Diocese of Caloocan that he heads.
“I wake up in the middle of the night praying for dead people,” David shared during a reflection session with the laity in the Archdiocese of San Fernando in Pampanga, his home province, on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT







The forum, “Am I My Brother’s Keeper? The Church in Times of Crisis,” gathered more than 300 lay leaders.
Most extrajudicial killings in the diocese took place in slum communities where the Roman Catholic Church could not provide sanctuaries to people in distress, among them suspected drug users or pushers, David said.FEATURED STORIES

The diocese has so far established 27 parishes that serve more than 2 million people.
“We have a parish that is only 100 square meters [wide], which is smaller than a chapel in Pampanga,” David said. 
He said teenager Kian Loyd delos Santos was killed on Aug. 16, the feast of San Roque, patron saint of Caloocan, which reminded him that Filipinos were dealing with a “modern plague of addiction to illegal drugs.”
“The solution is extermination, like in the time of San Roque where sick people were burned alive inside forests,” David told his audience.
“And these days, it is risky to fight extermination,” he added.
“The call to us Christians is to stand for what is right, to show courage. This is about our faith, not politics,” he said.
David never mentioned President Duterte in his talk but he flashed on a screen the Chief Executive’s statement, “Maganda ’yan (It is good),” to have 32 drug suspects killed during simultaneous police operations in Bulacan province.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


David said the killings of teenagers have been described as “isolated cases.”
He then enumerated the killing of Carl Angelo Arnaiz, 19; Reynaldo de Guzman, 14; Nercy Galicio, 16; Anjay Suldao, 16; Alvin Preda, 19; Allan Lastimodo, 18; Irish Nhel Glorioso, 18; John dela Cruz, 16; Liezl Limit who was pregnant at 16; Troy Villanueva, 17; Joel Segovia, 15; Angelito Soriano, 16; Sonny Espinosa, 16; and Kenneth Lim, 20.
Most of the alleged executions were led by a “Bonnet Gang with tagaturo” (masked men guided by a snitch), he said.
Authorities claimed that those killed fought back although their wrists showed cuff marks. The victims were often left with two sachets of shabu (crystal meth) and a .38-caliber pistol.
“Children are getting used to violence,” said David, who showed a photograph of children staring at the bodies of suspected addicts.
David said the church set up the Salubong community-based drug rehabilitation program, offered sanctuaries to people in distress, and operated a child protection program “to deeply involve the diocese in the protection of lives.”
He said the diocese also put up mission stations in place of parishes in slums, offered prayers and rang church bells at 8 p.m. daily.

Over a year after he became one of the first casualties in the government’s bloody and controversial war on drugs, Jaypee Bertes lives on — in the son he had always wanted but never got to see.
On Sunday, Jaypee Jr. was baptized at a church in Manila with his mother, Harra Kazuo, and other family members in attendance. It was a double celebration as it was also the boy’s first birthday.

For Kazuo, it has been a long and grueling few months since the death of her partner, Bertes, and his father, Renato, while in the custody of the Pasay City police.
“I always ask myself: Am I up to this?” she told the Inquirer on Sunday. “I can’t really say how I have managed to face life’s challenges but I draw strength from my children.”FEATURED STORIES

Bertes, 28, and 47-year-old Renato were among the first casualties when President Rodrigo Duterte launched an all-out war on drugs right after he took office on June 30.
Shortly before midnight on July 6, 2016, police offiers barged into Bertes’ house, a tiny room in the slums of Pasay City, and demanded that he show them where the “shabu” was hidden. 
Lawmen shoved aside Kazuo, who was then five months pregnant with Jaypee Jr., as they ransacked the house. Even her six-year-old daughter was not spared as a policeman lifted her diaper to check for contraband.
The police took Bertes with them and his father, fearing that something bad would happen to his son, insisted on accompanying him to Station 4.
The next day, Kazuo visited the pair and saw signs that they had been beaten in the few hours they were in detention.
Hours later, Bertes and Renato would wind up dead after they reportedly tried to grab the guns of PO2 Alipio Balo Jr. and PO1 Michael Tomas.
Kazuo admitted that her partner had used drugs occasionally and even sold shabu to make a little money on the side.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


But all of that changed when Bertes learned that he was going to have a son. “He promised to change. He said he didn’t want to die because he was going to become a father again,” she added.
The police, on the other hand, have a different version of events.
They said they chanced upon Bertes and his father gambling in the neighborhood and took the pair to the police station after drugs were found in their possession.
While in detention, father and son tried to get a police officer’s gun and they were shot as a result.
Lawyer Frederick Mikhail Farolan who represents Kazuo said that the murder case remains pending in a Pasay City court while the two policemen have gone into hiding.
Kazuo told the Inquirer that she and her husband initially wanted to name their son “Prince Ezekiel” which means “God strengthens.” But after Bertes died, Kazuo found it fitting to name her youngest after him.
“Every single day, I show him photos of his father and he calls out, ‘Papa, Papa.’ I tell him everything about his father and I tell him that I’m sorry that he couldn’t be here to guide him because he was taken away so early from us,” she said.
She will tell him of his father’s fate when he comes of age. But for “Anna,” their four-year-old daughter, her papa is just asleep, Kazuo said.
As she testified in the Senate hearings on extrajudicial killings in November 2016, the single mother became the face of grieving widows in the drug war. But behind the brave front was the constant fear for her life and her children.
“But if you know that you are on the side of truth, then you should continue fighting,” Kazuo said.


Despite the pain, she stressed that she has already forgiven the men who took her partner from her. “But I don’t think I am ready to heal just yet… To me, everything feels like it all just happened yesterday,” she said.
“For my son Jaypee, I want him to inherit my husband’s great way with dealing with people,” she told the Inquirer, adding: “But more than anything, I want him to grow up to be a good person.”

She said she didn’t know at first that it was her son who was the target.
Brondial’s 17-year-old sister said she heard him begging for his life: “I heard him ask the gunman not to shoot him because he had done nothing wrong. But the gunman hit him on the head with the gun and then shot him.” 
According to Rosanna, her son was not a drug addict. “He was addicted only to computer games and basketball. Isn’t that normal for a child?” she asked.
The Pasay police chief said that investigators were considering two angles in the “peculiar case” — vengeance and mistaken identity.
Senior Supt. Dionisio Bartolome told the Inquirer that a witness, Jorge Baladjia, had claimed that Gary Alandra was the “real target.”
Alandra, according to barangay officials, was on the drug watch list while his family had a reputation for being involved in illegal drugs.
Baladjia said that minutes before the shooting took place, he was talking to Alandra who later left.

Baladjia said that after several minutes, Brondial approached him and they started talking. At this point, a man on a motorcycle stopped in front of the victim and shot him.
Barangay 104 watchman Tony Bacsal said that the killer could have mistaken Brondial for Alandra as both were of the same height.
The two were also skinny, sported blonde hair and wore only navy blue shorts at the time of the shooting.
As for the vengeance angle, Bartolome reported that they found out that Jayson Brondial, the leader of a robbery group who was killed in a police operation in Makati in February 2016, was the victim’s older brother.
Another sibling, Jerry Brondial, was earlier arrested in Cavite on robbery and drug charges.
“We are looking at the possibility that other individuals such as their victims are exacting vengeance on the family,” Bartolome said.
The Pasay police have created a special investigation team composed of nine lawmen to look into the case.
Rosanna, meanwhile, had a message for the killer: “I hope his conscience bothers him. He didn’t even stop to think whether he was shooting a child or an adult.”

New and improved, they will soon be a fixture in every barangay in Quezon City, where authorities hope to gather anonymous tips or complaints on the government’s antidrug campaign.
Starting this week, bright blue fiberglass boxes will be distributed among the city’s 142 barangays under an initiative of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD).

Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, the district director, said that since July 2016 each barangay had been encouraged to put up drop boxes to gather information on crime and illegal drugs from residents. But it was only this September that a “standard design” was finally agreed upon.
Earlier media reports about the project simply described it as the “Drug Box” — since its markings encouraged residents, rather bluntly, to “drop here names of suspected illegal pushers/users.”FEATURED STORIES

Each barangay then was left to improvise on how its box would look like. Barangay Valencia, for example, came up with a rectangular one made of wood.
But today, the 12-cubic-inch receptacle is formally called the “Oplan Tokhang Suggestions and Complaints Drop Box.” 
It sports the various logos of officialdom: the QCPD, the city government, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Dangerous Drugs Board.
Eleazar said the boxes are there to encourage not just tips on criminals but also complaints against his own men. He stressed that he would be open to investigate QCPD members who would commit abuses under the Duterte administration’s intensified campaign against illegal drugs.
In July, the initiative came under fire from human rights groups and other critics who feared that the crowd-sourced information on alleged drug users or pushers could be used to draw up a “hit list” for vigilante-style attacks or questionable police operations.
But Eleazar assured detractors that all information obtained through the boxes would still be validated.
“We are encouraging community participation,” he stressed in an interview on Saturday. “We need intelligence monitoring and the residents themselves know the people in their neighborhood.”

“The information gathered would only be for case buildup,” he said. “If we don’t have evidence, we cannot make an arrest.”
He pointed out that the written tips coursed through the boxes would be considered no different from those received by the PNP through its text hotline.
“There are still tipsters out there who have no cell phones. This is about giving a chance to others,” he added.
In a way, the QCPD project is serving as the model that other cities and towns are now supposed to follow. It was implemented ahead of a recent DILG order for local government units nationwide to have similar initiatives under a program dubbed “Masa Masid” (or Mamamayang Ayaw sa Anomalya, Mamamayang Ayaw sa Droga).
A DILG memorandum issued in August, which revised the guidelines for Masa Masid, called for the setup of drop boxes as a means for citizens to report crime, illegal drugs, corruption and other threats to peace and security.
The memo even prescribed the proper procedures when opening a box and examining the contents. At least six members of a technical working committee should be present to witness it.
In Quezon City, the proposal is to open the boxes at 4 p.m. every Thursday, the Inquirer learned.
A police officer, who holds the key to the box as the designated “focal person” in a barangay, will unlock it in the presence of barangay officials and representatives from the Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse and Advisory Council (BADAC), the Liga ng mga Barangay, faith-based organizations, and civil society groups.
The representatives would also be in charge of monitoring the reporting system, as well as the segregation and assessment of information and its referral to concerned government agencies, including the PNP and the Office of the Ombudsman.
Eleazar said the boxes would be supplied by the QCPD. The barangays may place their orders at P2,000 per box, the money drawn from their BADAC funds.


The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL), however, continued to warn against the project as a “dangerous shortcut” in the fight against drugs and crime.
NUPL president Edre Olalia said having such boxes would have a chilling effect in communities where the police as “Big Brother” would be spawning “many Little Brothers” among the neighbors.
“It would only stoke intrigue and suspicion among residents,” he said in an interview. “Instead of unifying the people against the drug problem in a legal, scientific and holistic way, you divide and polarize them.”
“I don’t see it as justifiable, particularly within the framework of the drug war,” said Olalia, adding that he had never seen anything like it done in other countries.
The QCPD should instead stick to “good, old-fashioned police work that is scientific, systematic and credible” in building cases, the lawyer stressed.
“The state has all the resources, whether human or material resources, to conduct credible and reliable police work to pursue investigation and intelligence without crossing over the line of human rights violations,” he said.

Update
Three out of five Filipinos believe that only the poor get killed in the government’s deadly war on drugs, according to a survey conducted by the Social Weather Station (SWS) from June 23 to 26.

For his part, Philippine National Police Chief Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa conceded that most of those killed in the drug campaign were from the slums but said they were not the only targets of authorities.
The survey results show that 60 percent of Filipinos agree to the statement: “Hindi pinapatay ang mga mayayaman na drug pusher; ang mga pinapatay ay ang mahihirap lamang [Rich drug pushers are not killed; only the poor ones are killed].”FEATURED STORIES

On the other hand, 23 percent disagree – of which 12 percent somewhat disagree and 11 percent strongly disagree – and 17 percent were undecided.
Most of those who share the sentiment came from Metro Manila, with 75 percent agreeing. This is followed by Mindanao with 59 percent agreeing, balance Luzon with 58 percent, and the Visayas with 53 percent. 
The poll results came days after the SWS revealed that most Filipinos do not buy police’s claim that those killed under President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs had fought against the authorities.
The nationwide survey was conducted on 1,200 respondents with a margin of error of plus-or-minus three percentage points.
Three quarters of those surveyed also believe that Duterte should expose his list of drug personalities and charge them in court.
The survey found that 74 percent agree with the statement: “Dapat isiwalat ni Pang. Duterte ang kanyang listahan ng mga taong sangkot sa droga o “drug personalities” sa publiko at sampahan ng kaso sa korte ang mga nakalista. [Pres. Duterte should expose his list of drug personalities to the public and charge those in the list in court],” while 12 percent disagree and 14 are undecided.
This sentiment is highest among Metro Manila residents with 82 percent, followed by balance Luzon at 75 percent, Mindanao at 71 percent, and the Visayas at 69 percent.

In a statement, the SWS said “items on the administration’s campaign against illegal drugs are non-commissioned. They were included on SWS’s own initiative and released as a public service.”
PNP chief: Poor not only targets
In reaction, Dela Rosa said: “Well, the survey is still the perception of the people.”
Dela Rosa pointed out that the police had neutralized big time drug personalities, namely Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog and Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. in the anti-narcotics drive.
“Were those men poor? Certainly not,” the PNP chief said, adding that people should exercise fairness before commenting on the police anti-drug operations.
“Totoo naman talaga (It’s true). Mas maraming mahirap ang nagbebenta ng droga kaysa sa mayaman kasi (Those selling drugs were mostly poor people) you have to understand the structure of the drug pyramid,” he explained.
The PNP chief said the killings would only stop when the drug suspects would no longer resist authorities.
“Kung walang lumalaban, walang mamamatay. Hangga’t merong lalaban, talagang may mamamatay,” Dela Rosa said.

TAGBILARAN CITY, Bohol — Police officers killed a dismissed fellow enforcer in a buy-bust operation in Talibon town past 9 a.m. on Wednesday.
They identified the fatality as Edgardo Bunado, alias Ega, a 47-year-old former police officer 2.

Bunado had come to be considered as a high-value target in the campaign against illegal drugs in Bohol, according to Senior Insp. Jojit Mananquil of the Provincial Intelligence Branch (PIB) of the Bohol Provincial Police Office (BPPO).

Based on surveillance done by the police and Provincial Drug Enforcement Unit, Bunado was selling refreshment drinks in the town but it turned out that he was also allegedly peddling crystal meth, locally known as shabu.
On learning this, the police conducted a buy-bust operation against Bunado on Wednesday morning in Purok 1, Barangay San Isidro, Talibon town. 
When Bunado sensed that he was transacting with a police officer posing as a buyer, he immediately draw his firearm from his waist but he was shot first by the operating team.
“The suspect sensed that it was an entrapment. So he got his firearm to fire us. We were then prompted to retaliate to prevent him from harming the lawmen,” Mananquil said.
He was taken to Talibon District Hospital but he was declared dead on arrival by Dr. Vidal Manga.
Hospital staff recovered a P500 bill used as marked money, nine pieces medium-sized sachets shabu, and 14 small plastic sachets of shabu worth P472,000, and different cash denominations. They turned these over to the PIB.

The United States, Canada and Australia, three of the Philippines’ major trading partners and political allies, have joined 36 other nations in mounting international pressure on Manila to end the killings and the growing culture of impunity in President Duterte’s brutal antinarcotics campaign.
In a move that could rile the President, the 39 countries signed a joint statement calling on the Duterte administration to uphold the “universal principles of democratic accountability and the rule of law” in resolving the thousands of killings in his war on drugs.

More than 3,800 people have been killed by the police in antidrug operations since last year. Thousands of others were killed by unknown assailants suspected to be working with the authorities.
Responding to the statement, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the government would be happy to accept foreign assistance in ridding the country of the “scourges of drugs, corruption and criminality,” but it would never allow other nations to dictate how it should handle its internal affairs.FEATURED STORIES

In Washington, where he recently met US State Secretary Rex W. Tillerson, Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said the joint statement was “biased and based on questionable information.”
“It is very unfortunate that instead of engaging us constructively, some western countries would rather criticize and impose conditions as if they can do a better job than the government in protecting the Filipino people,” Cayetano said. 
The Philippine Mission to the UN also assailed the statement, describing it as “sweeping and politicized.”
Pursue investigations
In their statement, which was delivered by Iceland at the 36th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva on Thursday, the 39 countries urged the  government “to take all necessary measures to bring these killings to an end and cooperate with the international community to pursue appropriate investigations into these incidents.”
“We remain concerned about the thousands of killings and climate of impunity associated with the war on drugs, and note recent stated commitments to observe due process in investigating these crimes,” the statement said.
The 39 countries, which also included France, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, wanted the Duterte government to allow UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, to visit the Philippines without preconditions or limitations.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Mr. Duterte had repeatedly verbally attacked and cussed at Callamard for expressing her views on the country’s worsening human rights situation since he took office in June 2016.
Duty bound
The 39 countries reminded the Philippines that it was duty bound to observe the “highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” as a member of the UNHRC and called on Manila to investigate alleged human rights violations and “create a safe and secure environment for indigenous communities, journalists and HRDs (human rights defenders).”
In a speech he delivered in November last year, the President had threatened to kill human rights advocates critical of his take-no-prisoner strategy against the illegal drug trade.
He also warned he would order the bombing of lumad schools in Mindanao for allegedly teaching their students to “rebel against the government.”
Address violations
The joint statement expressed regrets that the government rejected 154 of 257 recommendations “necessary to address serious human rights violations,” which were presented during UNHRC’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the country’s human rights situation this year.
Abella said the UNHRC “unanimously accepted and commended” the Outcome Report on the Philippines at the UPR, but lamented that “some parties refuse to understand certain aspects of our human rights efforts.”
The government is committed to protect its citizens from drugs, corruption and criminality, he said.
“To achieve these ends, we will always be happy to accept the help of our foreign friends. But we will never accept dictation on how we are managing our own internal domestic processes,” he said in a statement.


Culture of impunity
Abella denied that a culture of impunity exists in the Philippines, saying the country’s justice system “does not tolerate any state-sponsored extrajudicial killings.”
“So let us be clear. There is no culture of impunity in the Philippines,” Abella said.
He said all “credible allegations” of human rights violations were under investigation following the Constitution and the laws of the land and “in compliance with the spirit of our national traditions of liberty and democracy.”
He said claims of extrajudicial killings and alleged circumvention of police procedures should be proven in court. “Failing these, such claims are mere hearsay,” he said.
Maria Teresa Almojuela, deputy head of the Philippine mission in Geneva, criticized the mostly Western countries that signed the statement for instigating wars that have killed thousands.
“It is ironic that many states joining the statement are the very same states that are the sources of arms, bombs, machines and mercenaries that maim, kill and massacre thousands of people all over the world, not only during their colonial past, but even up to today,” she said.
Independent investigation
Human rights activists welcomed the joint statement and called for an independent investigation of the killings.
“The Philippines has so far shown itself unwilling to heed the calls to end this murderous campaign and hold those responsible to account,” John Fisher, Geneva director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a statement late on Thursday.


Fisher said the UNHRC body should intervene and exercise its authority “to end the violence, support an international investigation into the deaths and demand accountability for all unlawful killings.”
Ellecer Carlos, of the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, said: “We appreciate the international solidarity against the deteriorating human rights situation in the Philippines, especially at a time when human rights defenders are vilified and threatened for the work that we do.” —WITH REPORTS FROM JHOANNA BALLARAN, NESTOR CORRALES AND THE WIRES

Two witnesses to the killing of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz told a Senate inquiry on Monday that the boy was on his knees when he was shot and that the shooters were police officers, but differed on the time the shooting happened.
Appearing at the third hearing called by the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, taxi driver Tomas Bagcal said he saw two police officers shoot Arnaiz at past 4 a.m. while another witness who gave his name as Joe Daniel said the shooting happened at 2 a.m. on Aug. 18.

Both witnesses, however, attested that Arnaiz did not die in a gunfight with police but was killed in cold blood.
“The question now is that they have different times (of the incident) but they saw the same thing,” Sen. Panfilo Lacson, the committee chair, told reporters after the hearing.FEATURED STORIES

Lacson said the Department of Justice (DOJ) should look into who between the two witnesses was telling the truth, and suggested authorities conduct a reenactment of the shooting based on their accounts.
He said the different times given by the two witnesses as well as the conflicting findings of the police and the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) on the entry and exit wounds of Arnaiz and the controversy about whether the body found in a creek in Nueva Ecija province was that of Arnaiz’s companion, 14-year-old Reynaldo de Guzman, could affect the case of government prosecutors. 
“It’s almost sure that there will be a finding of probable cause [against the Caloocan police officers] and the filing of information, but the question is, will this pass the test of guilty beyond reasonable doubt,” Lacson said.
At the hearing, Bagcal, on questioning by Sen. Grace Poe, said two boys boarded his cab after midnight on Aug. 18 in Pasig City and asked to be taken to 5th Avenue in Caloocan.
He said the older boy declared a holdup when they reached their destination.
Bagcal said the boy pulled out a knife but he managed to parry the attack.
He said a tricycle driver in the area helped him subdue his assailant and they took the two boys to the police station on 9th Avenue.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Bagcal said a police officer at the station later told him they would kill the two boys who held him up but he insisted he just wanted to turn the two in.
He said a police officer who identified himself as Sir Lakay told him they would leave the precinct. He said he went to his cab to leave the premises.
It was then, he said, that Sir Lakay asked him whether he wanted the number of holdup men to be reduced.
He said they went back to the precinct and later he heard Sir Lakay give orders to bring the two boys to a patrol car.
But the boys and another police officer boarded his cab and they all headed toward Dagat-Dagatan accompanied by three police officers on motorbikes.
He said it was past 4 a.m. when they stopped at a gasoline station and the police officer made the two boys get off the cab. A patrol car was there, too, he said.
Bagcal said two police officers forced one of the boys to his knees. The boy raised his arms and pleaded for his life, he said, but was shot by the officers, whom he identified as PO1 Jeffrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquilita.
The two officers were at the hearing and were pointed out by Bagcal.
The other witness, Daniel, said he saw the shooting and it happened before 2 a.m. near a gas station along C3 Road.
He said he was looking for an eatery after attending the birthday party of a friend when he saw the shooting.


He said he did not see a taxi in the area.
But like Bagcal, he said he saw a younger boy inside the patrol car.
Daniel also identified Perez and Arquilita as the ones who shot the boy later identified as Arnaiz.
“Our process here is so dismaying and, more importantly, scary. The police should log in people who went to the precinct so there would be evidence that you were there so you won’t just disappear or be missing,” Poe said after questioning the two witnesses.
Poe also recommended protection for Daniel, whose face was covered throughout the hearing.

“They should fix their priests first. They have many scandals. There are many pedophiles [among them]. They should fix their ranks first. Why don’t they scold their own priests?” Alvarez said.
He said it was possible that the questions asked of the SWS respondents might have been biased against the President. 
“Let us look at whether there is no slant here or if it is being used to say the trust in the President has gone down,” Alvarez said.
“First, what were the questions? Second, what areas were surveyed? In Mindanao, there was no decline. In fact, it went up one point. But it went down in the Visayas and Mindanao. So let us ask SWS, what are the areas and what questions were asked,” he said.
Uniform surveys
Told that the SWS questions were uniform every survey period, Alvarez conceded he had not read the reports.
Net public satisfaction with Mr. Duterte plunged 18 points from +66 to +44, while his net trust rating declined 15 points from +75 to +60 in June, according to SWS.

Alvarez also mistakenly attributed to SWS a statement that despite the fall in his popularity “there is still love” for the President.
He ranted that such a remark was unheard of coming from the pollster.
Told that the statement actually came from presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella, Alvarez joked: “Well, for me, it’s hard to talk about love.”

Pimentel and Almeranez were relieved from the PPSC and as police chief of Socorro town (Oriental Mindoro), respectively, following their arrest in relation to Luz’s murder.
Luz, 51, was the regional chair of the Citizens Crime Watch, an anticrime watchdog, when she was shot and killed in front of her house in Barangay Maligaya in Gloria town on Oct. 9 last year. 
Pimentel and Almeranez, who wore a balaclava and a woman’s wig on the night of Luz’s murder, were arrested by Gloria policemen after a pursuit. Two other suspects escaped.
The policemen were detained in the Gloria police station after two months under hospital arrest. They were later transferred to the National Bureau of Investigation’s detention facility in Manila.
In August, the court handling the murder case allowed their temporary release after posting bail worth a total of P1 million. The court granted the policemen’s petition for bail, saying the prosecution failed to establish “conspiracy” in the murder.
“After they posted bail, their forced leave [in the PNP] was also [lifted] and so [the payment of] their salaries resumed,” Destura said.
The suspension of the payment of their salaries, however, did not cover their two-month stay in the hospital “because the case had not yet been docketed at that time,” Destura said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Also in August, Chief Supt. Wilben Mayor, Mimaropa police director, signed the officers’ dismissal order after they were found liable for grave misconduct.
Records showed that the policemen spent only eight months in detention.
Supt. Imelda Tolentino, spokesperson for the Mimaropa police, said the policemen were asked to report to the regional police office in Calapan City on Oct. 17 to receive a copy of the dismissal order.
Pimentel and Almeranez have yet to file an appeal to the administrative case. On Nov. 3, they sought an extension to file their motion for reconsideration.
Earlier, Luz’s relatives chided the government for claiming that there were no extrajudicial killings (EJKs) on President Duterte’s watch.
According to them, Luz’s death is one that perfectly fits the EJK profile.
“Isn’t it [an EJK] when a state agent, someone in authority, unjustly kills a helpless civilian?” her sister Perlita Alvarez said in an earlier interview. “To me, that should be clear enough.”—MARICAR CINCO

Students and members of youth groups, some of them Church-backed, carried placards and prayed the Rosary with other participants in the rallies.
In this city, protesters assembled at St. Raphael Church and walked 4 kilometers to Albay Cathedral, which was designated as convergence area for the rallies that carried the theme “Stop the killings, start the healing.”FEATURED STORIES

Vincent Dominic Salinel, 18, a student of St. Peter’s Academy in Polangui town, said he joined the rallies because he believed these could draw government attention and help put a stop to the gangland-style executions of suspected drug users and pushers in mostly urban poor communities.
“I really feel sorry for the victims especially those students who were wrongly identified and killed by authorities,” he said.
“This has to be stopped,” he said. 
Kyle Escalada, a Grade 11 student of Divine World College of Legazpi Senior High School Department, said being at the rally was his way of sympathizing with relatives of victims of killings.
“I am offering prayers for them, that they may be comforted at all times,” he said.
He said he was “sick and tired” of hearing news about killings in the country.
“Our place is no longer safe,” he said.
“We don’t want to become another Kian,” Kyle said. “We want to enjoy our life to the fullest so please let’s stop the killings,” he said.

He was referring to 17-year-old Kian delos Santos who was killed by police in a drug operation in Caloocan City in Metro Manila.
Rev. Fr. Rex Arjona, Social Action Center director of the Diocese of Legazpi, said the main objective of the rallies was to raise the level of consciousness among the faithful about why the killings should stop and the process of healing should start.
“The call to stop the killings is a shared responsibility,” Arjona said. “It has to be a concerted effort, not only by the police or by the government and even by the Church.”
He said Church leaders were also calling on the government to practice accountability and transparency since good governance was attainable only if human rights and lives were respected.
After Mass, Bishop Joel Baylon, head of Diocese of Legazpi, and parishioners lit candles praying for government enlightenment.

The families of at least 30 victims of President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal war on drugs gathered at a Quezon City church on Tuesday, eve of All Saints’ Day, to remember their slain loved ones and press their demand for justice.
Mothers, fathers, spouses and children of the victims attended a Mass offered for the departed at San Isidro Labrador Parish Church in Bagong Silangan village.

Catholic priest Gilbert Billena, in his homily, said the victims would not find peace if their families would not seek justice.
“It might not be today or tomorrow, but we believe that we would attain justice if we act together,” he said. “And the day will come that God would hear our prayers, our shouts, and our hopes.”FEATURED STORIES

Billena is also the spokesperson for the ecumenical group, Rise Up for Life and for Rights.
Aside from prayers, the families also offered flowers and candles for the victims. 
They also shared stories of how they lost their parents or children, and comforted each other in tight embraces.
During the Mass, Erlinda Baginon, 69, could not stop weeping.
Her son, Antonio, was one of the first victims of the war on drugs that President Duterte launched right after taking office in June last year.
Antonio was shot dead by three unidentified men inside his home at Humanity Village in Bagong Silangan on July 11, 2016.
The 51-year-old was also the first to be killed in the village, where many of the city’s poorest reside.

“Without my son, I do not know what to do,” Erlinda said. “I do not have money even to visit his grave in Bagbag Public Cemetery or buy candles for him.”
From July 2016 to July 2017, at least 37 people were killed in Bagong Silangan, Billena said.
“Even us priests find it hard to sleep as we hear gunshots at nighttime … We became traumatized from hearing the sirens of ambulances,” he said.
Quezon City Police District records showed that since the start of the war on drugs, more than 900 people have been killed in the city, with 369 slain in police operations.
More than 540 have been killed by unknown assailants—cases described by the police as “deaths under investigation.”
The Batasan Police Station, which covers Bagong Silangan and five other villages, topped the district’s 12 stations in the number of deaths: 339 killed by unknown gunmen, 120 slain by police in drug raids.
After the Mass, the families of the victims gathered at the Batasan Police Station, just across the House of Representatives, to offer flowers for their slain loved ones.
The families also called on the police to fulfill their duty to serve and protect the people.
“This symbolizes the scene of the crime, because many families believe that their relatives were killed by the police,” said Nardy Sabino of Rise Up.
“We hope the police understand why we’re here, because those they killed also had dreams like them,” Sabino added.

Slain pedicab driver Michael Siaron, who became a global poster boy against the Duterte administration’s war on drugs, was actually killed by a drug syndicate and not by the police,  Malacañang said on Saturday.
The 30-year-old Siaron, whom police believed to be a drug pusher, was gunned down in Pasay City last year by motorcycle-riding men who left a cardboard sign with the words “Pusher ako, wag tularan [I’m a pusher, do not imitate]” near his body.

Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said police evidence indicated that Siaron was killed by a drug ring member.
“Authorities have put closure on the death of Michael Siaron, whose photo was compared to the Pieta image, after ballistic examination from a recovered firearm revealed that he was killed by a member of a syndicate also involved in the illegal drug trade,” Abella said. 
Killer also killed
He issued the statement after the Pasay City police identified Siaron’s alleged killer as Nesty Santiago, from whom lawmen supposedly recovered a firearm that was later subjected to a ballistic test.
Santiago himself was killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen on Dec. 29, 2016, five months after Siaron’s killing.
The police said that ballistic tests on Santiago’s gun matched the results of five other cases, all involving drugs. He was apparently a member of a syndicate involved in robberies, car thefts, hired killings and illegal drugs, the police added.
Abella said that the findings on Siaron’s death supported the administration’s claim that drug syndicates were behind many of the killings in the country.

Eliminating each other
“The Siaron case verifies what government has said from the start of the campaign… Many of these killings were perpetrated by those involved in drug operations as well—drug traffickers and pushers eliminating each other,” he said.
Premature attribution
“The relentless attribution of such killings to police operations was both premature and unfair to law-abiding enforcement officers who risk life and limb to stop the proliferation of illegal drugs in our society,” he added.
Abella said the government would continue to pursue cases of deaths under investigation to identify the culprits and bring them to justice.
The day after Siaron’s death, Mr. Duterte said in his first State of the Nation Address on July 25 that the media was trying to portray Siaron as Jesus Christ in Michelangelo’s Pieta sculpture.
“That’s how they are. We’re being melodramatic here,” he had said in Filipino.
But while recent opinion polls suggest 8 in 10 Filipinos support the drug war, the President’s trust and satisfaction ratings sustained their biggest drops since he assumed office.
Mr. Duterte subsequently pulled the Philippine National Police out of the drug war for the second time and designated the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency as lead agency.

The Department of Health (DOH) has bared its plans to ensure that drug rehabilitation services are more accessible and a better fit for the country’s drug dependents who are in need of treatment.
Out of the 17 regions in the country, only the Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan) region and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao do not have a regional drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation center (DATRC).

“No bigger effort has been mounted in the fight against drugs, with so many government and nongovernment agencies involved recognizing that drug addiction is a multifaceted problem that must be faced on many fronts,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
Duque made the remarks during the summit on illegal drug control and prevention in Davao City last week.FEATURED STORIES

The country has an estimated four million drug dependents, with around 2 percent in need of rehabilitation and support.
Earlier, Duque noted that large drug rehabilitation centers might be reconfigured as a complement to existing community-based drug rehabilitation facilities. 
This was after former Dangerous Drugs Board Chair Dionisio Santiago admitted that the mega drug rehabilitation center in Nueva Ecija was “a mistake” and “impractical.”
Santiago added that the funds used for the said facility could have been put to better use by funding smaller, community-based drug rehabilitation services.
Among the DOH’s plans are the development of DATRCs as one-stop shops offering treatment of substance use disorders as well as comorbidities and psychiatric conditions.
Soon, DATRC services will include treatment of substance use disorders such as alcohol and nicotine addiction.
“Regional hubs are envisioned to offer patients holistic rehabilitation from treatment to recovery, after-care and relapse prevention with maximum family involvement,” Duque said.

According to a police report, Karl was able to run inside their house but was still chased by the shooter.
“When we woke up, we just saw Tutoy lying on the ground with gunshots in the body and head, blood pouring from him,” Bernadette recalled. 
Police officers who arrived that noon told her the shooting might be a case of “mistaken identity.”
They said the suspects might be vigilantes looking for a robbery suspect called “Carlo Daga.”
Neighbors said that Carlo had not been living Sun Valley “for a long time.”
Asked to comment, Senior Supt. Leon Victor Rosete, chief of the Parañaque City Police Station, denied probers were looking into the “mistaken identity” angle.
“Who told them that? As far as I am concerned, our investigation has no leads on that,” Rosete said.

At his burial on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018, the family and friends of Karl, fondly called Tutoy, wore white bands and shirts calling for justice for his death. His family said he was not involved in drugs or any criminal activities, and was a actually a model son – a good basketball player, a volunteer rescuer and a youth leader in the making. (Photo by DEXTER CABALZA / Philippine Daily Inquirer)
He added that the only update they had on the case as of Sunday was through a closed-circuit television footage they had obtained. It showed a motorcycle riding tandem on Pajero Street at around 4 a.m. on Dec. 26.
“As if we could make up such stories,” Bernadette said. “That–s what the police said and that’s what people here are saying.”
Karl’s shooting had no witnesses except for the Nuñez couple, who could not identify the assailants as both were wearing helmets.
When news reached her in Dubai that teens ended up killed on the streets back in the Philippines, Bernadette was quick to warn her children, especially Karl.
“I always told him to be careful because anyone could be killed,” she said. “He reassured me that he was fine, that he was not into drugs or anything. That he was a law-abiding citizen. But God, look at what happened to him?”
What took up most of Karl’s time was playing basketball. His friends called him “most valuable player” and he was waiting for him to be selected as a varsity team member at Arellano University, where he was in his second year as a Hotel and Restaurant Management major.
At other times, he would be riding his motorcycle with other motorcycle enthusiasts. While on the road, Bernadette said, Karl would be helping those who had met accidents as he was also a volunteer rescuer.
He even planned on running for the next Sangguninang Kabataan elections as he would want to help more people in their community, his mother said.
“We just can’t accept the fact that our son’s life was lost just like that,” she said. “Why did they slaughter him like a pig? He wasn’t a criminal.”
Hundreds of friends and those whom Karl had helped flocked to the Nuñez house, sharing stories of him, until the wee hours of Sunday.


“I am at peace, because he was loved by everyone,” Bernadette said.
In one of the tables, Karl’s former classmates aty Sun Valley National High School were sharing food and drinks.
They had posted a a sketch of Karl on a seat, as if Karl was with them.
“Karl kept bugging us that we should have a reunion as early as possible,” said his friend Mark, who had traveled from Rizal. “We did it. It’s just unfortunate that it was on his wake.”
Last Christmas, Karl and Bernadette completed the nine-day Simbang Gabi, a novena of Masses that ended on Christmas Eve.
According an old saying, those who complete the nine-day series of Masses Old will have their wish granted.
“After the Mass, I asked Tutoy what his wish was,” Bernadette recalled. “At first he said it was a secret, but later on gave in and told me: ‘I just don’t want to see you cry anymore.’ And he just fell asleep on my lap while scratching his back.”
“Justice here in our country is elusive, but I believe Tutoy will be true to his wish,” she said. /atm

Judge Analie Oga-Brual of the QC Metropolitan Trial Court Branch 41 ruled for the acquittal of Harold Arevalo, saying the prosecution failed to support the charge of direct assault that the police filed against the vendor.

In a Nov. 17 decision, the court said the prosecution “failed to positively show” that Arevalo traded shots with the policemen who had killed his friends in a “buybust operation” on Aug. 15 at a house on Lower Sampaguita Extension, Barangay Payatas A.
“There was even no showing that the accused was the one whom they have transacted with prior to the incident,” the ruling said.FEATURED STORIES

Members of Quezon City Police District’s Batasan station, particularly Police Officers 2 Wilson Escuro and Herbert Angoluan, claimed that they conducted the operation in Barangay Payatas A based on tip that drugs were being sold in the area.
They said Arevalo was with the group of suspects they encountered and who fired shots when cornered. 
Police report disputed
But Arevalo, who managed to post bail after his arrest, disputed the report from the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) on the supposed drug bust.
In his defense, Arevalo said that at the time of the operation he was just a guest at the house of his friend Cherwen Polo, who was then celebrating his birthday. They were having drinks on the second floor with fellow construction workers William Bordeos, Darwin Hamoy and another man only known as “Rambo.”
A few minutes after midnight, armed men in civilian clothes barged into Polo’s house. Arevalo, who was upstairs with the other guests, started hearing gunshots.
Escape

With Polo telling him to escape, Arevalo leaped out of the second-floor window and landed on the neighbor’s roof.
But one of the officers managed to shoot him, hitting him in the left leg. Immobilized, Arevalo just let his body roll over and fall from the roof.
“This would prove that I have no intention to hurt any police officer and commit direct assault,” Arevalo said in his judicial affidavit. “I saw (the one) who shot me and he was in civilian clothes. But he was not able to get near me because I had already fallen to the ground [from the roof] and fainted.”
“I really didn’t know what happened because at that time I was only visiting a friend (Polo) and I just heard him telling me, tumakbo ka na! (run!)” he later said during cross-examination.
He recalled regaining consciousness in an empty lot. He then asked for help from uniformed policemen he saw nearby, and pretended that he was unaware of the raid on Polo’s house.
But he was placed under arrest while receiving treatment at East Avenue Medical Center, the same hospital where Polo was declared dead on arrival. Bordeos, Hamoy and Rambo were pronounced dead at Quezon City General Hospital.
The QCPD report said there was a fifth suspect—a John Doe—who was killed in the same operation. In earlier Inquirer interviews, the slain suspects’ relatives could not identify this fifth fatality and doubted whether he was really present at the drinking session.
Arevalo maintained he was not aware that the men who entered Polo’s home and declared a raid were policemen because they were not in uniform. “There was a raid inside that house because the people who lived there allegedly used drugs.”
In its decision, the court noted that police officers Escuro and Angoluan admitted during cross-examination that they did not see Arevalo holding a gun or firing back at them during the raid.
“Assuming arguendo that accused is one of the cohorts of those five deceased suspects, that does not exempt the prosecution (from proving) clearly his participation in the alleged firefight that they had prior to their death,” Judge Brual said.


Arevalo, who had since moved out of Payatas, was represented in court by lawyer Ann Marie Loren Pastor of the Public Attorney’s Office.

Jhoanna Ballaran/ INQUIRER.net
For volunteer Celine Bautista*, 36, giving out Christmas grocery bags to different families in Metro Manila is not just an ordinary task—it is a way of coping with the death of her stepson, John Jezreel “JJ” David, in the hands of the police last January under the government’s deadly campaign against illegal drugs.
Seeing the recipients’ faces light up gives comfort and strength for Bautista. Like her, the families also lost their loved ones in the brutal crackdown that has killed thousands of suspected drug criminals.

Bautista is a staff member of Rise Up for Life and for Rights, a Church-based non-profit group that provides assistance and support to victims of extrajudicial killings and their families. She joined the organization in August, as she and her husband sought ways to hold their son’s killers accountable.
“Nakakatulong sa akin personal kasi [naiibsan] din ang sakit. Alam ko, nandoon yung [pag-iyak] kasi hindi ganun kadali tanggapin ang nangyari. Pero sa kabilang banda, alam mo na merong aalalay para sa iyo, merong maglalaan ng oras para pakinggan ‘yung kwento mo,” Bautista told INQUIRER.net in an interview on December 20.FEATURED STORIES

(This helps me relieve the pain. I know that sometimes you get emotional because it is not easy to accept what happened. But on the other hand, you know that there is someone who will help you and spend time to listen to your story.)
Working for the organization helps her get through the pain of losing JJ, who went missing on January 19 and was found dead two days later in a morgue in Sta. Cruz, Manila. 
According to the spot report, he was killed in an alleged buy-bust operation in Delpan in Binondo after fighting back with the police.
Bautista denied the police’s claims as JJ, 21, never used drugs. Some residents in Delpan also told her and her husband, Denisse, that several policemen some in plainclothes and masks, came in the area to conduct an operation on the night of January 20.
One of the witnesses later saw three motorcycles with back riders in handcuffs, who were all brought to an old warehouse. The witness, an old man who lived beside the place, then heard the three men pleading for their lives before shots were heard, Bautista said.
“Naririnig nga raw niya yung nagmamakaawang bata. Meron nga raw nagsabi doon na ‘sir, kesa pahirapan nyo po kami, patayin nyo na lang po kami.’ Tapos meron nga raw siyang naririnig na, ‘sabihin nyo po sa papa ko, sabihin nyo po sa papa ko!’ Siguro kako ‘yun ‘yung anak ko,” she said as her voice quivered.
(He said he had heard the children pleading. One of them said: ‘sir, do not make us suffer, just kill us.’ [The witness] also heard one of them shouting, ‘please tell my papa, tell my papa!’ Maybe that’s my son.)

It took Bautista and her family months to recover, until they finally decided to seek help and sanctuary from a priest who then referred them to Rise Up.
Rise above the tragedy
Rise Up was formed in November last year with the belief that victims of the drug war should not remain victims. Instead, they should rise above the tragedy and become advocates for social justice and change, said Nardy Sabino, convenor of the group.
“Hindi pwedeng manatiling biktima, hindi pwedeng manatiling nagluluksa yung mga namatayan, kailangan nilang bumangon sa kanilang kalagayan, hindi lang dahil sila ay namatayan, bagkus, dahil sa kahirapan na kinakaharap nila,” Sabino said. (Victims should not remain victims, the bereaved should not remain grieving. They need to rise above their condition because they just do not lost their loved ones—they also face suffering from the poverty they face.)
“So Rise Up dahil ang pangarap ay maging bahagi sila ng isang social movement para sa isang social change,” he added.
(So we named it Rise Up because our hope is to make them part of a social movement for social change.)
Rise Up provides different kinds of support to families of the anti-illegal drug campaign, including sanctuary for the victims and their families, legal and medical services, and psychosocial debriefing. The most important, Sabino said, is the organizing aspect, to help the families get back on their feet again and help their fellow victims pursue justice.
Since last year, the group has documented and handled a total of 100 cases of killings, mostly in Navotas City, Caloocan, Manila, Quezon City, and Bulacan. Of these, three have been filed with the Ombudsman, including that of JJ David.
The group’s job is no easy feat—their resources are scarce, volunteers are exposed to stress and trauma in documenting cases, and they are left with the challenge of untangling the victims’ overlapping problems, Sabino said.
“Minsan iiyakan mo ‘yung mga problema, ‘yung patung-patong na trahedya,” he explained.


(Sometimes you’ll cry over the problems, the severe tragedy they face.)
They also have a limited number of volunteers to do the legwork for the immense number of those killed. So far, Rise Up has a total of 15 staff members, and only eight of them work full time.
But these challenges outweigh the group’s desire to hear more stories of the families and seek justice for the deaths of the thousands of victims of the government’s anti-illegal drug campaign.
Christmas wish
This Christmas, Sabino called on the public to give value to life by respecting human rights.
“Pinakamahalaga ngayon lalo na magpa-Pasko makita natin yung buhay kaysa kamatayan. Piliin natin yung liwanag kaysa kadiliman. Mahalaga na ang tao, kung humaharap ka o tumatanaw ka sa isang Pasko, makita mo yung biyaya na ang mahalaga sa Diyos ay yung buhay, hindi yung pagpatay,” he said.
(What is important this Christmas is to see life instead of death. Let us choose light over darkness. If you look forward to Christmas, it is important to see that the most important blessing from the Lord is life, not death.)
JJ’s death has caused Bautista and her family much pain and anguish—but her newfound life as an advocate of justice alleviates her suffering. For her, the most important thing this Christmas is to continue living for others, especially for those like her who have lost their loved ones in the drug war.
“Kailangan kung naghahanap ka ng katarungan, lumabas ka. Ipakita mo sa kanila na kahit alam mong mahirap hanapin ang katarungan, hinahanap mo,” Bautista said. (If you are seeking for justice, you need to get out. Let them know that even though it is hard to find justice, you continuously seek for it.)

The body of Jeannie Rose Porras, 39, a member of the militant Compostela Farmers Association (CFA), was found by relatives at a funeral home in Nabunturan town, according to Jay Apiag, Karapatan Southern Mindanao secretary general.

Apiag, quoting Porras’ son, said the victim failed to return home in Compostela town after meeting a still unidentified person on Thursday.
“On Dec. 15, Jeannie’s son decided to report the incident to police. He also informed fellow CFA members [about her disappearance], asking their help to look for his mother,” he said. 
Apiag said Karapatan and CFA were trying to gather details regarding Porras’ disappearance and death.
He said the victim was also a farmers’ organizer in Compostela.
Her organization, Apiag said, “had long been the target of killings, illegal arrests and harassment due to [its] antimilitarization, antimining and agrarian reform campaigns.”
On Nov. 29, CFA member Rodrigo Timoteo was shot dead by unidentified gunmen outside his house in Sitio Mambusao in Ngan village, Compostela, while he was preparing to join a protest rally on Bonifacio Day.
Late last year, unidentified suspects gunned down Jimmy Saypan, former CFA leader, as he was driving his motorcycle on his way to Compostela.

Saypan’s death in October 2016 started the string of killings in Compostela Valley, Karapatan said.
In March this year, couple Ramon and Leonila Pesadilla, who were farmers, were killed in Barangay Osmeña, Compostela, as their 5-year-old grandchild watched in horror.
The Pesadilla couple, according to Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), had donated a parcel of their land to a local lumad school.
In linking the military to the killings in Compostela Valley, KMP cited other incidents, including the Dec. 5 disappearance of Jean Bustamante, 17, a lumad member of CFA.
Bustamante, who was accused of being a New People’s Army rebel, was later found held in a camp of the Army’s 66th Infantry Battalion in Mambusao town in Compostela Valley. —FRINSTON LIM

Still in mourning a year after their loved ones were slain, families of victims of extrajudicial killings in Caloocan City condemned Philippine National Police chief Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa’s latest pronouncement urging them to “move on.”
Dela Rosa made the statement last Saturday during the Quezon City Police District’s giftgiving program attended by nearly 700 children, most of whom were orphaned by President Duterte’s war on drugs.

“Do you (Dela Rosa) really think it’s that easy for us to get over their deaths? You are not the one who lost someone,” said Emily Soriano, the mother of 15-year-old Angelito, who was among the seven people gunned down by masked men in Barangay 176, Bagong Silang on Dec. 28, 2016.
“It’s been a year since they died and that’s it? Maybe that’s why your nickname is Bato, because your heart is just as hard as stone,” Soriano added.FEATURED STORIES

Led by ecumenical rights group Rise Up, Soriano and the kin of the other six held a vigil at the barangay’s covered court and on their graves in Tala Cemetery to commemorate their first death anniversary.
The anniversary coincided with the Biblical celebration of the Day of the Innocents, which commemorated King Herod’s orders to execute male babies in Bethlehem in order to kill baby Jesus. 
During the vigil, the group demanded an end to President Duterte’s war on drugs, which they likened to “Herod’s massacre.”
‘Palit-ulo’
“These seven are just some of the many killed (in Caloocan City under the war on drugs). Now we will no longer stand for another Herod to sow death among our nation,” said Norma Dollaga, Rise Up secretariat.
The seven were gunned down by at least three motorcycle-riding men believed to have been targeting a drug suspect.
Among those killed were Angelito, 15; Jonnel Segovia, 15; Sonny Espinosa, 16; Kenneth Lim, 20; Ednel and Cristina Santor; and a pregnant Analyn Diamla.

Their families maintained that the seven were not criminals nor involved in illegal drugs and were likely victims of “palit-ulo,” alleging that the gunmen’s target was Jay-R Santor, a drug suspect who earlier surrendered to authorities under the government’s “Oplan Tokhang.”
Santor owned the two adjacent shanties where the seven were gunned down. The teenagers had gone to attend a birthday party for one of Santor’s sons.
A year later, their families said they found it difficult to move on from their untimely deaths, lamenting how the gunmen snuffed out their futures.
Jimmy Segovia, Jonnel’s father, said that sometimes, he would imagine that his son was still out there peddling buko juice, just like when the boy was still alive.
Emily Soriano, Angelito’s mother, bewails that her son now lays dead in Tala Cemetery while the suspected gunmen who killed him still roam free. “Be, masisisi mo ba si Mama na sinisisi ka niya kasi hindi ka nakinig sakin na ’wag ka na umalis noong gabing ’yon?” she wept.
Processing grief
“It’s so hard to process. I still can’t accept that he’s gone. I already told him that night not to visit his friends because that place was dangerous and he still went,” he said.
At the time, he said, Jonnel was already home when their friend Edward Villanueva invited them to Santor’s house. Jonnel ended up getting shot 13 times during the attack while Villanueva survived.
“Imagine, 13 times. Like they were animals being slaughtered. My son did not deserve that,” Segovia said.
Miguelito, Angelito’s brother, echoed the sentiment. “I may not know anything about how my brother died but what I do know is that he was a student with dreams and a future ahead of him. And then getting told to move on? They know nothing of the pain we are dealing with.”
Soriano pledged on Angelito’s grave that she would continue seeking out justice for her son.


“To all of us who fell victim to this war on drugs, let us unite together and seek justice for the deaths of our sons. To others, please, don’t wait for this to happen to you as well,” she said.

MONTEGRANDE
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has opened an investigation into increasing killings in the government’s counterinsurgency campaign.
Human Rights Commissioner Jose Luis Martin Gascon told the Inquirer on Tuesday that the CHR-Calabarzon office had deployed a team to investigate the Nov. 28 clash between government troops and suspected New People’s Army (NPA) rebels at Nasugbu town, in Batangas province, that left 15 people dead, including five women, one of whom was a student activist from the University of the Philippines.

Gascon said a team from the CHR central office also had been sent to Nueva Ecija province to investigate the killing of retired Catholic priest Marcelito Paez, 72, on Monday night, hours after he helped secure the release from military custody of an organizer for the left-leaning peasant group Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Gitnang Luzon.
Gascon did not mention the killing of religious leader Lovelito Quiñones, 57, in a clash between government troops and suspected NPA rebels in Oriental Mindoro on Sunday, but human rights group Karapatan has asked the CHR to look into Quiñones’ death and the killing of activists in the government’s counterinsurgency operations, which have intensified since the collapse of peace talks between the Duterte administration and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).FEATURED STORIES

Shoot on sight
Karapatan blames the killings on the military, which President Duterte has ordered to shoot NPA rebels on sight, promising troops that he has their back. 
Mr. Duterte also has declared the CPP and the NPA terrorist organizations.
“We’ll continue to monitor events as they unfold,” Gascon said. “Every incident that results in violent clashes is something of concern to anyone, certainly us.”
Gascon said the CHR was investigating “without making any prejudgments.”
“In the context of armed conflict, where you have two sides that are both armed, there are established norms . . . that must be complied with and we need the cooperation of everyone who knows about the facts to determine if international humanitarian law was complied with or not,” he said.
“There were allegations [of] excessive use of force and violence and attacks on noncombatants, and these are some things we would like to be able to clarify,” he added.

Return to negotiations
Gascon said the CHR was “worried” that there might be an “intensification” of clashes between government forces and communist rebels with the collapse of the peace negotiations.
He said both sides should adhere to agreements reached involving human rights and “do everything to return to negotiations so that we can hope to diminish the violence.”
Karapatan blamed the recent killings on the “Duterte regime’s fascist policies and pronouncements.”
“We condemn Duterte and his fellow bloodthirsty cohorts in the military, police and Cabinet … for masterminding these policies, foremost [of which is] this regime’s counterinsurgency program ‘Oplan Kapayapaan,’ which has instigated these attacks,” Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay said in a statement on Tuesday.
“Duterte and his team of bloodthirsty beasts are setting a new threshold for state terror,” Palabay added, noting that 10 activists were killed in just two days.
Karapatan cited initial reports of possible human rights violations, noting “the number of casualties” and “the manner [by which] they were killed.”
104 political killings
“[Just] more than a year in power, the Duterte government has claimed 104 lives in political killings, mostly farmers. There are 449 political prisoners languishing in jails; there are hundreds of people in communities under constant threat of militarization, harassment and food blockade,” said Roneo Clamor, deputy secretary general of Karapatan.
Speaking at the wake for Paez on Tuesday night, Bishop Roberto Mallari of the Diocese of San Jose, in Nueva Ecija, said the government and all other sectors should be concerned about the killing of Quiñones and “all other killings that include children and [elderly people.]”


“Human lives are important, be they very old [or] very young, suspected rebels, soldiers, activists, suspected illegal [drug] pushers and users,” Mallari said.
“They should not be [just] statistics in the [problems that] our country is going through,” he said. —With reports from Anselmo Roque and Tonette Orejas

Karapatan blamed the killings on goons of a land owner involved in a land dispute with farmers.
Jaime Paglinawan, secretary general of Bayan Muna-Central Visayas, said the funeral march was a show for respect for Badayos and to demand justice.
Moises was buried in Bayawan City on Dec. 3, according to Amid Juntilla, Mefa vice chairperson.
Juntilla said they called off a planned protest action in Bayawan on Sunday because farmers were afraid that another attack would happen.
He said protest actions were held in Dumaguete City, the provincial capital.

Meanwhile, in Iloilo City, about 2,500 protesters led by the Movement Against Tyranny and Bagong Alyansang Makabayan joined a program in front of the provincial capitol before marching through the city’s main streets.
They burned an effigy of a two-headed figure with a rifle depicting the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and President Rodrigo Duterte.
“The killing of human rights activists and even a priest and pastor, harassment of the media and journalists and moves to curtail institutions that serve as a check and balance to the President are manifestations of the growing tyrannical rule,” said Reylan Vergara, secretary general of Karapatan-Panay.
Vergara spoke at the rally days after two unidentified men in a motorcycle went to his house in Mandurriao District, apparently checking if he was there.
“I was not there during that time,” Vergara told the Inquirer. “But my mother-in-law monitored the men, who stayed for about 20 minutes near the front of our house. They left when the realized they were also being watched.”
He said his neighbors also reported that unidentified persons had asked for the location of his house.
“There’s an apparent focus on human rights workers and activists who have been vocal against extrajudicial killings of suspected drug personalities, farmers and members of indigenous people’s communities,” he said.
In Roxas City in Capiz, about 1,000 protesters led by Bayan attended a rally at the Roxas City Plaza Bandstand.
About the same number of protesters marched from the provincial capitol to Crossing Banga in the capital town of Kalibo in Aklan.
In Negros Occidental, at least 3,000 members of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan in Negros Occidental held a rally at the public plaza to denounce what they called a “tyrannical rule” of President Duterte.


They marched to the Bacolod public plaza on Sunday afternoon to mark the International Human Rights day as they chanted “Duterte patalsikin, patalsikin, pagbayarin (Duterte kick him out, kick him out, make him pay).”
They then burned effigies of the head of President Rodrigo Duterte atop the body of a dog on a leash held by US President Donald Trump were torched at the Bacolod public plaza on Sunday afternoon.

The drug suspects known only as Abis and Jom-Jom, both believed to be around 30 to 35 years old, were small-time pushers that the QCPD had been monitoring for several days, Eleazar told the Inquirer.
Police were also looking into their possible involvement in other crimes as a tattoo on Jom-Jom’s back suggested he was a gang member. 
The drug bust happened at 3:10 a.m. on Sunday, when PO1 James Gumidam of the Batasan police station bought P1,000 worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) from the suspects.
According to Eleazar, the suspects noticed Gumidam’s signal to police operatives and started firing at the backup team. They hit Andres twice in the chest but he was saved by his bulletproof vest.
The suspects got on their motorcycle, leading to a chase which ended at 3:30 a.m. on Payatas Road when they were cornered. Instead of stopping, the suspects began shooting at the police, leading to a fire fight which left them dead.
Found in their possession were P90,000 worth of shabu, a sachet of dried marijuana leaves, a .38-caliber revolver, a 9-mm pistol, two cell phones, their motorcycle and the buy-bust money.

Fought back
Supt. Bernard Tayong, speaking for the North Cotabato police, said police were serving search warrants when five men ran out of one of the target houses and fired at the
policemen. 
Police fired back, hitting two suspects who were rushed to a hospital in Poblacion, another village, where they died. Three of the suspects surrendered.
Tayong identified the slain suspects as Andamen Sapalon, 40, and his brother, Pisko Kanda Sapalon, 30, both residents of Batulawan.
Tayong said Sapalon headed a local drug gang. Those arrested were Baina Taudin, Samer Samad and Johaina Labarios.
On Tuesday, two men identified as Sindatuk Baliwan and Jonathan Mangakoy were also killed in Kabacan town after they allegedly clashed with police during an antidrug operation.

But the suspects’ wives claimed that their husbands were victims of a rubout.
Amira, wife of Baliwan, insisted her husband was “killed in cold blood.”
In the town of Naawan, Misamis Oriental, police arrested three family members, including a village official, for drug pushing.
Senior Insp. Jaime Bastatas, team leader of the Provincial Drug Enforcement Unit, said arrested were Annie Seriño, a village councilor of Linangkayan in Naawan; her husband, Zaldy, and their son, identified only as Bimbo.
Bastatas said police found five sachets of “shabu” (crystal meth), a rifle grenade, M16 bullets and the marked money that police used for the buy-bust operation.
Planted evidence
Seriño said police planted the drugs and guns.
In the town of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao province, soldiers and antinarcotics agents arrested an alleged big-time drug peddler who had been operating near the headquarters of the Army’s 6th Infanty Division.
Datu Daffi Sinsuat was arrested after he fell for a buy-bust operation in the village of Lower Capiton, just 800 meters from the Army headquarters. —Reports from Edwin Fernandez and Divina Suson

(Photo by RICHARD A. REYES / Philippine Daily Inquirer)
Taxi driver Tomas Bagcal on Sunday confirmed that it was 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz who robbed him in Caloocan City last month, but belied the police story of a gunfight, calling Arnaiz’s killing “scripted.”
After more than a week in hiding, the 54-year-old cabbie finally surfaced, protected by Rise Up for Life and for Rights, a network of Church people and human rights advocates.

Speaking at a news briefing in Quezon City, Bagcal claimed he was able to catch the robber, whom he later identified as Arnaiz, with the help of bystanders who he said mauled the former University of the Philippines student.

“I took him to the police station, alive,” Bagcal stressed, adding that he wanted Arnaiz to undergo inquest proceedings.
“In an hour, the person who robbed me was killed,” he added. 
Bagcal said Arnaiz tried to shoot him in the cab, but the gun jammed.
He said Arnaiz whipped him in the head with the gun. He showed reporters an injury on his right arm, which he said he sustained in blocking Arnaiz’s blows.
Bagcal said Arnaiz got off the cab and fled. He said he gave chase and sought help from bystanders.
Bagcal stressed that the teenager who robbed him on the night of Aug. 18 and the slain boy identified as Arnaiz were one and the same person.
“When I grabbed him while he was being mauled, I was able to remove the hood of his jacket,” Bagcal said, explaining how he had identified Arnaiz.

At the police station on 9th Avenue, Bagcal said the police told him to follow them in his cab along C-3 Road, but he declined to give details.
“I saw someone walking ahead, then I heard several gunshots,” he said, adding that he took cover behind an electric post for fear of being hit.
“After that, I saw that the person who robbed me was already dead,” he said.
 
‘Scripted’
“But the manner by which they killed him seemed like a stage play, or was scripted,” he added.
The Caloocan police report told a completely different story: After the robbery, Arnaiz got off the cab and fled and Bagcal, while giving chase, “chanced upon” two policemen who were patrolling their beat and asked them for help.
The two officers, identified as PO1 Jeffrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquilita, traded shots with the robber, who was killed on the spot.
Bagcal also said he did not have any affidavit.
“That is not my real statement,” he said, referring to two conflicting statements that police claimed he had submitted to them.


The cabbie said when he took Arnaiz to the police station, the officers there only asked him for his name, age, and date of birth, as well as his cab’s original receipt and certificate of registration.
14-year-old implicated
“The police implicated a 14-year-old in my first affidavit, but only one person robbed me,” he said, referring to Reynaldo de Guzman, who was last seen with Arnaiz in their neighborhood in Cainta, Rizal province, on Aug. 17.
De Guzman’s body was fished out of a creek in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija province, on Sept. 5. His head was wrapped in packing tape and his body bore at least 26 stab wounds.
Bagcal did not explain how De Guzman was implicated, but said he would disclose everything he knew at the “proper venue.”
He said Arnaiz was not handcuffed in the police station.
Autopsy done by the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO), however, showed that Arnaiz had handcuff marks on his wrists.
The PAO crime scene investigation also led to the conclusion that the killing was staged, with no bullet tracks or slugs found on the grassy lot.
Death threats
Bagcal said there were threats to his life and his apartment was ransacked recently, prompting him to seek protection from  Rise Up.


The group said it would continue to give “sanctuary” to Bagcal, as he was a potential witness to the killing of Arnaiz.

Taxi driver Tomas Bagcal, 54, gave two different locations where Carl Angelo Arnaiz, 19-year-old former student of the University of the Philippines, allegedly robbed him on Aug. 18.

This was based on two statements that he gave the Caloocan police on Aug. 18, immediately after the robbery, and on Aug. 29, a day after Eva Arnaiz, the teenager’s mother, identified her son as the one killed by police officers.
In the first affidavit, Bagcal said his Carl, his passenger, declared a holdup as they reached the barangay hall of Barangay 28.FEATURED STORIES

In the second affidavit, he said the passenger declared a holdup along C-3 road.
 
Bagcal’s first affidavit is composed of two pages. The driver answered 18 questions asked by homicide investigator PO2 Rodolfo Bautista inside the Caloocan City Police Station.
In the first affidavit, there was no description of the robber. Bagcal simply answered “no” when asked if he knew who held him up.
Bautista: “Nakilala mo ba kung sino ang nanghold up sayo?”
Bagcal: “Hindi po.”
In the second affidavit, given 10 days after the crime, Bagcal provided specific descriptions of the robber who took his wallet.
Bautista: “Nakilala mo ba kung sino ang nangholdup sayo?”

Bagcal: “Hindi po, namukaan ko lang po siya, noong mga panahong iyon, naka itim na sweat shirt na may hood, itim na sombrero, blue na maong short pants, naka tsinelas at may dalang bag.”
According to Bagcal, he went to the police station on Aug. 29 because he was “invited again” to “shed light” on the case.
“Muli po kasi akong inimbitahan para magbigay ng aking nalalaman sa nangyari paghold-up sa akin at kalaunang pagkapatay ng holdupper at liwanagin ang ilang mga detalye,” Bagcal said.
The second affidavit is composed of three pages.
This time, Bagcal answered Bautista’s 24 questions.
Bagcal also clarified and emphasized the following information:
1. The number of suspects
In the first affidavit, Bagcal mentioned the words “mga suspect.” In the second affidavit, he emphasized that there was “only one suspect.”
2. The description of the robber
3. The location and time where he was robbed


4. Which part of his body was hit by the robber
In the first affidavit, Bagcal said he was hit in the arm. In the second affidavit, Bagcal said he was hit in the hand. To show proof, Bagcal stated that a certain PO1 Ellamil accompanied him to Caloocan Medical Center for a medical exam.
In the second affidavit, Bagcal also detailed how he joined the supposed chase and how sure he was that the cops got the right target.
Bautista asked: “Paano mo nalaman o narinig na hinabol at naabutan ng mga pulis yong suspect.”
Bagcal replied: “Pagkwento ko po ng nangyari, naghiwahiwalay na po sila para mahuli yung suspek pero sumunod parin po ako sa nag co-counter flow na motor, ginamit ko po yung taxi ko.”
Bautista: “Paano naka sigurado yung mga pulis na ang hinabol nila yung suspek na nangholdup sayo?”
Bagcal: “Habang naka sunod po ako sa kanila nakita po namin yung suspek tapos huminto po kami sa gater (sic) tapos dun ko na po sinabi na ‘sir yun yung nangholdap sa kin’.”
In both affidavits, Bagcal said he was 150 meters away from where the shootout took place.
But in the second affidavit, Bagcal specified his location during the shootout. He said he was hiding behind n electric post during the exchange of fire. When it was over , the cops called him to show him the body lying on the ground.
Bautista: “Nang matapos na yung barilan mga pulis at holduper may napansin ka ba sa mga pulis or hold-uper?”


Bagcal: “Nakita ko nalang na nakahiga na yung holdaper tapos lumapit yong dalawang pulis para tingnan kung buhay pa tapos sinipa nung isa yung baril ng holdaper.”

Malacañang believes “malignant elements” were behind the recent killings of young people to sabotage President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, but opposition lawmakers said the claim was intended to shift responsibility for the deaths away from the administration.
Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Saturday that Mr. Duterte’s campaign to wipe out the illegal narcotics trade affected “powerful narcopoliticians and deep pocketed drug lords who flourished prior to this administration.”
ADVERTISEMENT







These quarters were expected to discredit the government in the eyes of the people, he said.
“It should not come as a surprise that these malignant elements would conspire to sabotage the President’s campaign to rid the Philippines of illegal drugs and criminality, the centerpiece program of the administration, to succeed, which may include creating scenarios stoking public anger against the government,” Abella said.FEATURED STORIES

“The recent killings apparently targeting the youth should be viewed with suspicion and urgency,” he said.
The killings of Kian delos Santos, 17, Carl Arnaiz, 19, and Reynaldo de Guzman, 14, triggered public outrage. 
The President on Friday said that the killings were “deliberate” and meant to be blamed on the police. Police shoot in self-defense and do not bother wrapping the head of a slain suspect, he said, citing the case of De Guzman.
“Someone is sabotaging them,” he said.
There are no suspects yet in the killing of De Guzman, whose body was found floating in a creek in  Gapan, Nueva Ecija, with dozens of stab wounds days after he and Arnaiz went missing.
Official investigations, however, found that police officers were responsible for the intentional killing of Delos Santos.
The National Bureau of Investigation and the Public Attorney’s Office filed separate murder and evidence planting charges against four Caloocan City police officers in the killing of Delos Santos last month.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Officers admitted killing Delos Santos, an alleged drug runner, and Arnaiz, an alleged robber, but said they did so in self-defense.
Sen. Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of Mr. Duterte, rejected his claim of sabotage.
“Now that public opinion is against the killings of these minors, he reangles the murders he has sanctioned as sabotage,” De Lima, who is detained in Camp Crame on drug charges, said in a statement.
“Wrap your minds around [the President’s claim],” she said. “Discombobulate your brains until it makes sense. But it won’t because this is the logic of the sociopath, where empathy is not even an itch that the deranged President can feel.”
Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, another strident critic of the President, said Mr. Duterte was “backpedalling” because of the growing outcry over the deaths.
Another opposition lawmaker, Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin, a member of the independent bloc in the House of Representatives, said Mr. Duterte’s statements about the killings were “preposterous and absurd.”
He said that as President, Mr. Duterte had almost absolute control over the government, including the security sector, and so much intelligence funds that could be used to find the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings (EJKs).
“It’s the height of irony to blame others while his PNP (Philippine National Police) under General Ronald dela Rosa has done nothing to curb the EJKs nor has the DOJ (Department of Justice) prosecuted people responsible for thousands of murders,” Villarin said.
However, Sen. Richard Gordon, who led an investigation of alleged EJKs last year, said a sabotage “to destabilize” Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs was possible.
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chair Chito Gaston said his agency’s monitoring and evaluation of drug-related killings “has reached a point where we can say there may be a pattern.”


Gaston spoke with reporters this week at the House of Representatives where he sought an increase in the CHR’s budget amid talks that it would be given zero-peso allocation for 2018.
“These consecutive killings of boys that must be answered by law enforcement, which CHR has monitored, will probably support our argument as to why it is not the time to give the CHR zero budget, but instead to increase it, so we may adequately respond to new developments,” he said.
Liberal Party senators said they would block a proposed massive increase in the PNP budget for the antidrug campaign unless it presented alternatives to the killings that have claimed thousands of lives.
For 2018, the PNP has earmarked P900 million from P20 million this year for President Duterte’s war on drugs.
“Filipinos deserve better solutions to the drug menace. We should be capable of developing solutions that leverage on the strength of our families, our communities and our passionate young Filipinos instead of this over-reliance on violence,” Sen. Bam Aquino said.

“They [victims] died there in their home after the gunmen shot them in different parts of the body,” Zaldarriaga added.
He said that witnesses described the suspects as wearing face masks, black ball caps, black long sleeve shirts and black pants. 
Zaldarriaga said the shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday at the victims’ house at 74 Kasipagan St. in Barangay Batasan Hills.
The five men arrived in the area on two motorcycles without license plates, according to witnesses.
Zaldarriaga said Remedillo’s wife, Arseña, witnessed the incident. She said their adopted son, Dela Cruz, had been arrested before for illegal drugs although he was later released.
However, when the government launched its antidrug campaign, he did not voluntarily surrender to barangay officials.
Her husband, on the other hand, was never involved in drugs and “did not even smoke cigarettes,” Arseña told the police.

“We still can’t say if this is drug-related. The case is still under investigation by PO3 Marlon dela Vega,” Zaldarriaga said.

Ana lost her husband and 19-year-old son to President Duterte’s brutal war on drugs in September last year. She and her four children have been living in trauma and constant anxiety since.
They moved out of their small shanty in a slum colony in Metro Manila for fear that police would kill another member of the family. 
Ana’s eldest daughter, a psychology student, dropped out of school to look for a job.
Before tragedy struck, Ana juggled odd jobs, doing laundry and cleaning houses in her old neighborhood.
Her husband augmented her small earnings by working as a drug runner, bringing home P200 to P300.
Now in her new job doing mosaic art, Ana brings all her children—two daughters, aged 18 and 17 and two boys, 11 and 8—to work to make sure that they are all safe.
“We are still shaken by what happened. Whenever my smaller children see a policeman, they tremble and tell me we should all hide,” she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Like Ana, 25-year-old Maria lost two members of her family—her father and eldest brother, who was a single parent—in the first wave of the drug killings in July last year.
Although hard up, she took in her brother’s 8-year-old daughter. “Now, I have three daughters in all and I also have to send her to school,” she said.
But because her husband had been identified as a drug peddler, they moved out of their home, entrusting their children to their parents. Now, they see them only on weekends.
Fear has also shrunk their world. “We make sure that we’re home before it gets dark. We also put multiple locks on our door,” Maria said.
Ana and Maria represent the other face of the war on drugs: broken families living under constant fear and trauma, mothers and wives becoming sole breadwinners, and orphaned children.
According to Dr. Ma. Lourdes Carandang, a clinical psychologist and family therapist, the family is the unit of society most hurt by the war on drugs and many such families are either ignored, pitied or blamed rather than helped.
As the government has no intention of easing the campaign against narcotics, she said, it must establish a program that will help the families of those killed recover from trauma and fear, and help them become productive.
Private groups can also take part in this effort, she said.
Traumatized children should be given priority, she said. If neglected, these children could suffer psychological disorders, such as depression, and may even take drugs, she warned.
Dr. Tomas Bautista, a psychiatrist at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, said the benefits of the antidrug war to the community—safer streets and fewer criminals—would be just temporary if the government would not deal with the roots of drug abuse.


“Today, we might feel safer because there are fewer criminals on the loose. But even if we extinguish all adult drug users while poverty persists, the next generation will have the same problem,” Bautista said.
From a clinical perspective, Bautista said, drug addiction is an illness caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors.
Poverty, he said, generates citizens who have an unhealthy brain circuit for happiness because they don’t have the right nutrition to produce the building blocks for happy chemicals and also lacked education to balance this.
And poverty, he said, is the reason drug use is higher in poor communities.
Many poor people, in desperate need for gratification and happiness, turn to illegal drugs to turn on the switch responsible for releasing happy hormones in the brain, he said.
“People will just shift to another [addictive substance], like alcohol, or to behavioral addiction, like gambling, as long as poverty fuels [their] desperation for gratification and happiness,” he added.
The overly gratified also falls into drug abuse to satiate too many happiness receptors in the brain, he said.
“I really hope that the government and society [will] further broaden their view of the drug problem,” Bautista said.

Salazar allegedly drew a pistol and fired at Ruiz, who was hit but not harmed thanks to his bulletproof vest. The suspect was then shot dead by Ruiz after a brief chase.
Salazar’s death raised to 23 the number of drug suspects killed by the Pasig police  under the year-old Duterte administration.

President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent statements praising the police for killing 32 suspected drug offenders in one day encourage law enforcers to commit abuses and disregard rules in the bloody war on drugs, according to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).
CHR chair Chito Gascon said in a press conference on Friday that the “pace and scale” of the recent killings in Bulacan and Metro Manila that resulted in a double-digit death toll in just one day was “unprecedented” in the year-old antidrug campaign.

32 killed
In what seems to be an intensification of the campaign, police killed 32 people in Bulacan province in separate operations early in the week.FEATURED STORIES

Dozens of others were killed by the police in Manila and Caloocan City in similar operations a few days later.
Unknown assailants also killed several drug suspects in Quezon City and Marikina. 
Reacting to the Bulacan police report, Mr. Duterte said 32 kills in one night was a “good” thing, adding that if that were the daily toll, the country could be rid of the drug menace.
Impunity
Gascon said such statements “emboldened” security forces to commit abuses and “created conditions for impunity to prevail” where “no one is held into account.”
CHR Commissioner Gwen Pimentel-Gana said the CHR was investigating around 600 drug-related cases in which 800 people had been killed.
However, only 23 cases have been filed with state prosecutors and only one case — the killings of a father and son in Pasay in July 2016 — has been filed in court.

“A singular case — this is unacceptable,” Gascon said. “We need to make sure that our prosecutors do their job of investigating thoroughly all of these cases and filing appropriate charges.”
“Otherwise,” he said, “the climate of impunity … perpetuated and promoted by President Duterte will create the conditions of ratcheting up the body count.”

After he was shot by police, Palma was brought to a hospital where he died of gunshot wounds, according to Espela.
Espela said police recovered two .45 cal. pistols, bullets and drugs at the Palma house. 
In the town of Bato, Leyte province, a man tagged by police as the town’s No. 1 drug personality was killed in a gunfight when antinarcotics agents conducted a drug buy-bust operation also on Saturday.
Police said Crispin Adaron, 39, put up a fight during the buy-bust operation in the village of Daanglungsod in Bato past 11 a.m.
Two other suspects, allegedly associates of Adaron, were arrested during the operation conducted by agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in Eastern Visayas and the regional police office’s drug enforcement units.
The arrested suspects were identified as Edison Pide Tablo, 38, and Jeffrey Manuerca Alboro, 34.
Found in the possession of Adaron were four sachets of shabu, P500 in marked money and a .38 cal. revolver.

CITY OF MALOLOS — Eleven more suspects were killed as a 24-hour drug operation in Bulacan province ended on Tuesday night, bringing the number of fatalities to 32.
It was the most number of drug personalities slain in a day in what Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat Jr., provincial police director, described as “uncontrollable situations” in operations that have mostly turned into kill or be killed situations.

The police operations, however, have drawn support from lawyers in Bulacan.
“It’s better to see 20 drug addicts dead than see 20 innocent women or children raped and killed,” said lawyer Jose de la Rama, Central Luzon governor of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP).FEATURED STORIES

“The policemen are just doing their job. It means the drug problem is so wide in scope and so many dependents are still using [narcotics] despite the government initiative to curtail it. The police must be serious in their drug operation in the province and the officers must be commended for doing their job,” said De la Rama, also the IBP Bulacan chapter president.
Lawyer Juvic Degala said the result of the operation was unprecedented in the history of Bulacan. 
“Until proven otherwise, the police officers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly,” he said.
Bulacan Rep. Jonathan Sy-Alvarado said: “The deaths which occurred in a span of one day are alarming. I appeal to people still involved in illegal drugs to stop these activities and surrender peacefully.”
As of Wednesday, families of the slain suspects, most of them identified only by their aliases or first names, had not claimed their bodies, police said.
But a complaint arose about missing motorcycles, pieces of jewelry and cash when the police searched the house of Victoria de la Cruz and her live-in partner, Alvin Marquez, who were among those killed in a police operation in the City of Malolos.
The complaint, however, was aired over social media. “If that were true, the complaint should be filed formally [with the police] and not [posted] on Facebook,” said Danilo Clavio, village chief of Atlag in Malolos.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Clavio said De la Cruz and Marquez were on the Atlag drug watch list.
Caramat said the killing of 32 drug suspects and the arrest of 109 others were the results of 67 police operations in 21 towns and three cities of the province.
Police seized 359 plastic sachets of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) weighing 235.07 grams, and 765 grams of dried marijuana leaves.
Police recovered two grenades and 33 assorted guns from the suspects.
Records from the Bulacan police showed that 602 drug suspects had been killed from July 1, 2016, to May 31 this year.
Responding to concerns over the high number of deaths in antidrug operations, Caramat said the police were ready for any investigation.
“I believe in the legality of our operations and I believe our police operatives are strictly following … procedures and, of course, observing human rights of the victims.  On our part we know that we have done nothing wrong but, of course, there are some sectors that will not believe us.  We are open [to] any investigation,” he said in a press conference on Wednesday at the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame.
“All we can say is that we don’t have any control of the situation. As much as possible, we wanted to remove those elements that would lead us into bloody encounters … but, as I’ve said, we don’t have control of the situation.”
In conducting “one time, big time” operations, the PNP, he said, went for “shock and awe” through superiority in strength, numbers and arms as well as the element of surprise to eliminate factors that could lead to armed encounters with drug suspects.
Caramat later told the Inquirer that most drug suspects had developed the mentality of never surrendering.


“The effect of illegal drugs on them is that they would rather die than be caught or arrested. These are notorious [drug personalities]. When we say notorious, they will fight. They are stubborn and incorrigible already,” he said.

Robredo stressed the need for due process to hold a wrongdoer liable and not put the law in one’s own hands.
“Hindi na hinahayaang gumiling pa iyong mga proseso na nasa Konstitusyon natin para siguruhin na iyong hustisya nabibigay para sa lahat. (The processes under the Constitution is not being allowed to run its course to ensure justice is being given to all),” she said. 
Meanwhile, Akbayan Party-list Rep. Tomasito Villarin said Mr. Duterte’s remarks were “callous and insensitive,” especially in light of his recent admission that the drug problem cannot be easily solved contrary to his campaign promises that it ended in six months.
“President Duterte’s previous admission that illegal drugs can never be fully eradicated the way the US did it in the 70s should send a signal to the PNP to at least take a step back and stop the killings,” the opposition lawmaker said in a statement.
“Lauding this crime only reflects the rejection of a person’s right to life, and our very own humanity as Filipinos,” he added.
Mr. Duterte, in a Wednesday speech before the members of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, described as “maganda (good)” the recent deaths in a “one-time, big-time operation” in Bulacan on Tuesday.
“’Yung namatay daw kanina sa Bulacan, 32, in a massive raid, maganda ‘yun. Makapatay lang tayo ng mga another 32 everyday, then maybe we can reduce what ails this country (The ones who died in Bulacan, 32, in a massive raid, that is good.

Minority senators rallied behind a snowballing move to seek justice for Kian Lloyd de los Santos, the 17-year-old killed by the police last week, claiming he was a drug runner.
Sen. Risa Hontiveros said on Sunday that with the help of an institution, her office had taken custody of the family of De los Santos, as well as witnesses to the boy’s slaying in Caloocan City that had sparked national outrage and calls for an investigation in the Senate.

Hontiveros, in text messages and in a radio interview, said her office was securing the family and the witnesses as they prepared for the legal battle to find justice for the Grade 12 student. This would include their appearance at an upcoming Senate inquiry into the recent spate of killings of drug suspects by the police.
The senator, who attended the boy’s wake on Saturday and met with his parents, said the family was being threatened.FEATURED STORIES

“Our primary concern is the continued security and protection of the family and the witnesses who can help bring justice for Kian,” Hontiveros said. She said the family and the witnesses were ready “to tell the truth.”
On Sunday, the Philippine National Police chief, Director General Ronald dela Rosa, told a television program that De los Santos was a drug courier of his father and uncles. 
While Dela Rosa said he was “disappointed” that the boy was killed by the police he described the operation as “legitimate” because there was basis that De los Santos was “a source of drugs in the area.”
Dela Rosa said the boy was a “victim of his own father.”
The PNP chief said he had ordered his internal affairs service to investigate the killing, saying he did wish “an isolated case to diminish the PNP’s accomplishments.”
Hontiveros and Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV said they would support a Senate resolution to seek an inquiry into the killings of Kian and 80 drug suspects in the intensified campaign against the drug menace.
Trillanes and detained Sen. Leila de Lima scoffed at President Duterte’s order for an investigation of the boy’s killing.

“The chief investigator and mastermind of the daily carnage ordering a probe into the Kian killing? What a farcical joke!” De Lima said in a statement.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon urged Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II to remove Caloocan city prosecutor Darwin Cañete “for his manifest partiality and hostility” toward the victim.
Cañete said Kian might not be that innocent.
“The risk of prejudice is too great in the case of Cañete and this behooves the secretary of justice to intervene, if he is
intent on fulfilling his job of administering justice in this country,” Drilon said in a statement.
A witness to the killing has recounted to the Inquirer how three policemen opened fire at De los Santos, who was arrested outside a drug store. “He was pleading, ‘Wag po sir! Wag po sir! (Please don’t).’ But those men still fired at him,” the witness said, adding she was willing to testify on what she saw that night.
Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday joined calls for an inquiry into the boy’s killing.
“What we want is an independent investigation, because, you know, if the parents are not confident with the kind of investigation conducted, it’s as if the case is not given closure, and what happened to Kian is still happening,” she said after attending the teenager’s wake at Barangay 160 in Caloocan.
The Department of Education (DepEd) also denounced De los Santos’ killing.
“While we acknowledge that law enforcement is an important aspect in the government’s comprehensive efforts to battle illegal drugs, ensuring accuracy of information and upholding the rule of law should not be compromised,” the DepEd said in a statement.
The Ateneo de Manila University senior high school student council called for public condemnation of De los Santos’ killing.


“We most strongly express our frustration and deep indignation against extrajudicial killings. We believe that anyone who values life, rule of law and due process, would instinctively share our deep outrage. For too long, we have failed to collectively express our unfathomable anger [at] the injustice brought about by the war on drugs,” it said.
The Child Rights Network (CRN) said: “The state should be made accountable for such blatant act of inhumanity committed against Kian and many others. CRN reminds the government that any efforts to pursue peace and order should never be at the expense of human rights and rule of law, and should always uphold the best interests of Filipino children.” —With reports from Nikko Dizon, Jerome Anng, Vince F.

The boy’s death, one of the thousands since the administration launched its war on drugs last year, triggered an outcry even from some of the President’s allies after witnesses and video footage disputed police claims that Delos Santos was a drug runner who was killed after he shot at officers pursuing him.
Mr. Duterte earlier said that if the investigation pointed to the police’s liability and they were convicted, they would go to jail. 
He had promised to protect law enforcers who carried out his orders in the drug war, saying he would not allow them to be jailed or would pardon them. But he also said this did not mean he would tolerate wrongdoing.
The circumstances surrounding the killing of Delos Santos had stunned both opponents and supporters of the President, prompting senators on both sides to open an inquiry into the young man’s death at the hands of the police.
This has again put the Philippine National Police, its leadership and procedures under the spotlight.
An official of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) weighed in on the issue, reposting a meme from a pro-Duterte Facebook account that defended the PNP as an institution against attacks prompted by wrongdoings by some officers.
“If the acts of a few priests cannot be used to condemn the entire church, why do some insist on condemning the entire PNP because of three cops,” said the meme, which was posted by CHEd Commissioner Prospero de Vera on his Facebook page.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


“Good point,” De Vera remarked.
Some priests and bishops have been the most vocal critics of the President’s war on drugs, saying the bloody campaign was antipoor.
De Vera appeared to seek a more balanced view of both the Church and the PNP, citing the “consistency (or inconsistency) of the position taken by many people or by institutions” toward offenses committed by both the police and the clergy.
“It is possible that there are many more policemen involved in illegal activities, but the same goes for priests,” he said.
In defending his antinarcotics campaign, Mr. Duterte has often made scathing criticisms of priests and the Church, saying they were not helping rid the country of the drug menace.
He said early this year that the Church and the clergy were all talk and had no moral ascendancy, citing instances when priests had molested young students.
Later, he called the Catholic Church the “most hypocritical institution” in the country.

The 17-year-old, whose shooting by police on Aug. 16, drew public outrage and sparked a Senate inquiry, was buried Saturday afternoon in a small niche at La Loma Cemetery amid intermittent rains.

“The heavens wept,” Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David said in his homily during the funeral Mass, comparing the grief of Delos Santos’ parents to that of the Virgin Mary who had to bury her son. And like Jesus, the bishop said, Kian was beaten up and killed despite being innocent.
Leading the funeral march were members of the Church, ecumenical human rights group and several militant organizations who described the boy’s death as proof of the government’s failure to address the drug problem.FEATURED STORIES

The killing has electrified the country and galvanized what had previously been limited opposition to President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs. Thousands of people have been killed since the President took office 14 months ago.
Police said they shot Delos Santos in self-defense after he opened fire on them during the “One-Time, Big-Time” antidrugs operation conducted by Police Community Precinct 7 lawmen in Barangay 160, Caloocan City. 
But Erwin Lachica, 37, a welder who witnessed the shooting said that the Grade 12 student was standing outside the family’s store when the police, who were not in uniform, grabbed and started punching and slapping him before they put him in a headlock and dragged him away. No gunbattle took place, Lachica said.

Kneeling face down
CCTV footage from a neighborhood security camera shows two men marching someone, his head bowed, through a nearby basketball court, while a third man follows. The boy’s body was later found nearby, kneeling face down, and dumped near a pigsty.
The police officers, identified as PO3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda and PO1 Jerwin Cruz, told the Senate hearing on Thursday that they were bundling away a police informant, not Delos Santos. Multiple witnesses, however, said they recognized the youth.
Two autopsy reports, gunpowder tests, eyewitness testimonies and the CCTV footage also belied the police claims.

On Saturday, Delos Santos’ emotionally charged funeral march had mourners clad in white shirts and black ribbons chanting  “Justice for Kian, justice for all!”
Fr. George Alfonso, Sta. Quiteria, Caloocan, parish priest, prayed that the police would “salve the ailment of drug addiction in the country, not with guns, but with prayers and promise of reform.”

Comforting Saldy and Lorenza delos Santos, Bishop David pointed to the family members of some 20 other minors killed in the drug war who had come to offer their condolences.
“Only parents whose children’s lives were snuffed in the prime of their lives would be able to wholly comprehend your grief,” David said, singling out in his homily 19-year-old Raymart Siapo from Navotas, who was killed by vigilantes two months ago. He was told to run, but couldn’t because he was born with clubfeet.
“You know what Raymart’s mother’s name was? Luzviminda. Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao—the three island regions of the Philippines. Through her, the Philippines also lost a child [in Raymart],” David said.
‘Cruel war’
Personnel from the Department of Justice’s witness protection pogram flanked the Delos Santos family, who, apart from occasional emotional outbursts, were silent and refused to talk to the press.
Among the mourners were Public Attorney’s Office chief Persida Acosta, La Salle president Bro. Armin Luistro and Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes.
United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Agnes Callamard,  also tweeted: “My heartfelt condolences to Kian family and to all families victimized by this cruel war. #Makehisdeaththelast #Philippines.”
Callamard earlier described Delos Santos’ death as murder and said all unlawful deaths must be investigated.

The mourners were joined by members of militant groups Anakbayan, Bayan, ACT Teachers, Migrante International; ecumenical group Rise Up for Life and for Rights; and students from different schools and universities.
An emotional Saldy spoke fondly of his favorite son, describing him as the diligent shopkeeper of the family’s small school supplies store.
“Sometimes, I ask [Kian], ‘Why you, of all people? You know, we worked hard so that he could study and become a good citizen … But now he is no more,” he said through tears.
He said he hopes the officers involved in Kian’s death did not have children so they would not have to experience what they had gone through.
‘Beg forgiveness’
“I hope you’d go to Church as soon as possible. It’s not too late to beg for forgiveness,” he said, addressing the three policemen.
“I think those who stood on the streets for Kian were not just onlookers; they were genuinely sympathetic to him and what he stood for,” said running priest Fr. Robert Reyes, who had been at the forefront of protest actions for Delos Santos.
Reyes even likened the boy’s funeral procession to that of the late Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. in 1983, which drew a huge crowd. “ … The only difference was there was no social media in Ninoy’s time. Now, while the procession was taking place, people all over the world know exactly what was happening,” he said.
The boy’s killing has fueled longstanding public anxiety about the drug war’s brutal methods, and could generate wider opposition to a campaign whose critics have so far been largely limited to priests, activists, lawyers and a handful of prominent politicians.
Still, Duterte remains popular, said Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Manila-based Institute for Political and Electoral Reform.

Vulnerable
“It’s not really a tipping point,” he said of Delos Santos’ killing. “But Duterte is vulnerable. His popularity will take a hit.”
By the time the funeral march of about 2,000 people reached northbound Edsa, the mourners had occupied four of five lanes of the highway, with militant groups decrying the President’s “fascist” rule on a megaphone.  Delos Santos’ friends briefly took over to rap to a song they had composed for him: “Wala kang kasalanan, wala kang kasalanan, inosente ka,  Kian! (You are innocent, Kian)!”
“We no longer have our joker,” said one of Delos Santos’ friends, Sharmaine Joy Adante, 15. He liked joking around and didn’t do drugs, she said.  He had wanted to join the police so that his mother, who works in Saudi Arabia, could afford to live in her own country, the girl added.
Reyes said he hopes the people’s call to end the killings does not get buried alongside Delos Santos.
“We should ask everybody not to let this day pass without praying that the Lord (would) make us understand what Kian had done for us, and what He wants us to do for Kian and the other victims,” he said. “Kian is no longer just a 17-year-old boy. He means something more than just one life.” —With a report from Leila Salavaerria and the wires

A youth group on Thursday condemned the killing of three teenagers by police in the Duterte administration’s campaign against illegal drugs and crime.
Also on Thursday, an opposition lawmaker decried the killings as the “new normal” in the administration.

Members of Youth Resist gathered outside the main gate of the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, and staged a die-in to protest the police killings of 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos on Aug. 16 in Caloocan City and 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz on Aug. 18 also in Caloocan and the subsequent death of his 14-year-old friend Reynaldo de Guzman under unknown circumstances.

Police said Arnaiz robbed a taxi driver and they killed him in an exchange of gunfire.
It remains unclear when and where De Guzman was killed. 
His body was fished out of a creek in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija province, on Tuesday.
He had been stabbed 31 times.
The Youth Resist protesters carried signs that read “Du30 Stabwounds,” referring to the number of knife wounds found on De Guzman’s body.
In the House of Representatives, Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin issued a statement saying the PNP should account for De Guzman’s death. “It is now the norm to kill alleged criminals with latent and excessive force, gangland-style executions that minors are not even spared,” Villarin said.
“The barbaric cruelty of his death is unthinkable but under the Duterte administration, it becomes the new normal,” he said.

“We are moved by the family’s trust and confidence in Rise Up in assisting them in these trying and challenging times. We pray we can fully extend solace and strength to our distressed and fearful brethren,” the statement said.
Bagcal went missing shortly after Arnaiz’s body was found by his parents in a Caloocan City funeral home 10 days after the boy was reported missing. 
Police said Arnaiz, a former University of the Philippines student, was shot dead in an alleged shootout with police responding to Bagcal’s report of a holdup.
But both forensic examinations by the Northern Police District and the Public Attorney’s Office disputed police claims that Arnaiz had resisted arrest and had fired at the police.
Arnaiz was last seen on Aug. 17 with 14-year-old Reynaldo de Guzman, who was found dead on Sept. 7 in a creek in Gapan, Nueva Ecija.
De Guzman had at least 26 stab wounds, with his head wrapped in packaging tape.
National Bureau of Investigation agents had been looking for Bagcal amid fears that he might have been killed because he could provide important information on Arnaiz’s killing.

The decision was reached after an hourslong standoff on Saturday that began with an agreement to turn them over to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG).

The CIDG arrived at San Roque Cathedral in Caloocan City at around 2:30 p.m. on Saturday with the father of one of the minors, a cousin of the other minor. The police was eventually joined by Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption.

“With the help of [Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David], it was clarified who would continue to provide the witnesses with protection,” he added.

Before the killing of Kian delos Santos, 17, during a police operation in Caloocan City last week, youngsters in Pangasinan province had met violent deaths in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war that’s supposed to rescue them from the drug menace.
Those incidents that left victims as young as Danica Mae Garcia, 5, remain unsolved. She was felled by bullets meant for her grandfather, Maximo, at Barangay Mayombo in Dagupan City, exactly a year ago today. Along with her cousins, she was then preparing to attend her afternoon classes in a nearby public school.

The children were behind the curtain that separated the dining room that also served as a living room from their bathroom, where they were either brushing their teeth or taking a bath.

Danica Mae was hit in the head and died in her grandmother’s arms, one of the youngest victims in the drug war.
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) offered financial aid, but nothing has come of it, according to Danica Mae’s grandmother, Gemma. 
Based on police records, 1,269 of 1,364 villages in 43 towns and four cities in the province were drug-affected at the start of Mr. Duterte’s campaign last year.
As of June 15, 1,088 villages, five towns and a city had been declared drug-cleared soon.
The government’s antidrug campaign also resulted in the arrest of 1,577 drug users and pushers.
Thirty-three people were killed when they shot it out with the police. The deaths of 66 others were under investigation, including that of Danica Mae.
The unsolved cases include that of Roman Clifford Manaois, 20, and Rowena Tiamson, 22, who were classmates in a university until he transferred to another school. They both dreamed of building a house for their parents.

The two were killed on the night of July 19, 2016, when gunmen went on a rampage, attacking suspected drug users and pushers.
But Manaois and Tiamson were neither addicts nor drug traffickers, their parents, relatives and friends insist. They were at the wrong place at the wrong time, and perhaps, with the wrong company, when hit men killed them.
Manaois, nicknamed “Oman,” was fetching water when he was asked by John Mark Serrano de Vera, a neighbor, to accompany him to an eatery in Dagupan City to buy “kaleskes,” a kind of soup.
Manaois hopped on the back of the tricycle which De Vera owned. On their way to the eatery, they picked up one Zaldy Abalos.
At 2 a.m. the next day, De Vera’s father rushed to the Manaois’ house in Barangay Carael, crying out, “Go to barangay [Lucao] hall. Oman was shot,” said Dennis, father of Manaois.
“We thought Oman was only hit in the leg,” Dennis recalled, his eyes getting red. But when Dennis and his wife arrived at the barangay hall, they were told to proceed to a morgue where they found their son.
Abalos, the hit men’s apparent target, was also killed, but De Vera was able to run.
The parents of Manaois were at first angry with De Vera whom they blamed for his death until they learned that he, too, was hit, although not fatally.
After the hooded gunmen shot Abalos, they trained their guns on Manaois and De Vera. They started to run when a bullet struck the back of Manaois, piercing his heart. De Vera tried to help Manaois get up but the young man told him to run for his life.
“[Manaois] was a good son,” Dennis said. “He was a big help in the house. He cleaned the house, cooked food. He had no vices at all, let alone drugs.”


Graduation did not come for Rowena Tiamson, who was killed also on July 19, 2016. She would have finished her mass communication course at Colegio de Dagupan in October last year. A school choir member, she also sang at two restaurants in the city to earn money.
At 10 a.m., Tiamson headed for school, which was just a walking distance from her house on Arellano Street, according to her mother, Teresita, 57.
“But at 5 p.m., she was not back home yet so I texted her to ask where she was. She said she went with her friends, a girl from Barangay Mayombo and a boy from Manaoag. At 9:40 p.m., I was already worried and called her up. Her telephone rang three times, then there was silence. I could not contact her anymore,” Teresita said.
The next day, the Tiamson family learned of Rowena’s death from a TV newscast.
Teresita said, “The newscaster asked if anybody has a missing daughter who has a tattoo of a musical note on her wrist, as a body of a girl was found in Manaoag.”
The family went there and found Tiamson. Her head was wrapped with packaging tape. Her body bore bullet wounds. A cardboard was strung around her neck with the words: “Don’t emulate, she is a pusher.”
The families of Manaois and Tiamson have realized they would not be able to find justice for the murder of their children, at least, not under the present administration.
“We cannot fight them. Duterte backs the police and the killers, to whom would we turn to?” Teresita asked.

“They are Kian’s friends and they feel so bad that he’s being maligned in the media and social media as a drug courier, a runner. He’s not. He’s a good kid. A diligent student. He wanted to be a policeman,” Ambrosio said.
She said the witnesses had expressed concern about the possible “disruption of their lives and the safety of their families.” 
Senator’s custody
The witnesses — aged 13, 16 and 31 — are under the care of Sen. Risa Hontiveros.
Ambrosio said she had met the witnesses several times. She also assisted them on Wednesday when they met representatives from the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Bureau of Investigation at the Philippine General Hospital.
The lawyer said she was considering filing murder charges against the Caloocan policemen involved in the killing of Delos Santos.
Hontiveros’ camp would continue to provide sanctuary for the witnesses after they declined to be placed under the custody of the Public Attorney’s Office.

The senator also scoffed at criticisms that her decision to help Delos Santos was politically motivated.
Credibility
She said she had been very vocal against systematic killings under the Duterte administration.
Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II on Wednesday raised doubts about the credibility of the three witnesses, “considering the bias of their handler.”
Aguirre stressed that witnesses were welcome to the government’s witness protection program.

The Philippine National Police on Wednesday disputed the findings of an autopsy conducted by the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) on Kian delos Santos, claiming the 17-year-old had only  two gunshot wounds and not three.
The PNP Crime Laboratory (PNP-CL) said it was impossible for the teenager to have been killed execution-style simply because he was not shot at close range, although tests found no trace of gunpowder nitrates on Kian’s hands.

At a press briefing, Chief Supt. Aurelio Trampe said the autopsy on the teenager showed only two bullet wounds in the head, the entry wounds below the left ear and the other directly in the left ear.

Trampe, the crime laboratory director, pointed out that, contrary to the findings of PAO medicolegal officer Erwin Erfe, there was no gunshot wound in the back.
“Based on the report there was no soot or stippling, which means he was shot from a distance,” according to PNP-CL medicolegal office officer in charge, Jane Monzon. 
Soot is the black substance emitted by a fired gun while stippling or tattooing is an abrasion caused by hot powder from a fired pistol that sprays around the wound and burns the skin, Monzon explained.
Stippling only occurs when the barrel of a gun is less than 60 centimeters (approximately two feet) from the target.
“I assume that the barrel of the gun is more than 60 centimeters away from the victim,” Monzon said.
Already embalmed
She pointed out that while the PNP-CL got first dibs on the autopsy, ahead of the PAO, the teenager’s body was already embalmed.

Monzon clarified that it could not be immediately deduced from the result of the autopsy if the teenager was prone or supine when he was shot.
“If it  is embalmed, there are a lot of limitations and sometimes you cannot really recognize an entry or exit wound,” she said.
Monzon was referring to the finding of a third gunshot wound by the PAO, which the PNP-CL could not explain.
Asked if the PAO conclusion that Kian was executed was definitive, Monzon said: “It seems impossible based on our report … There was no soot and stippling that would suggest that he was shot at close-range.”
The PAO claimed the teenager was shot behind the ear while lying prone, with his killer standing over him.
It said Kian was shot three times—first in the back then twice in the head—and pointed out that there was no indication that Kian had fought back.
PAO chief Persida Acosta said that the wounds indicated that the teenager was intentionally killed.
The PNP paraffin test appeared to validate the PAO findings that Kian had not fought back.
The PNP-CL test on the teenager’s hands yielded negative for any trace of gunpowder nitrate.
But Trampe said the fact that parrafin testing was done more than 72 hours after the incident could have affected the outcome of the examination.


A report from the PNP-CL also found that the 9mm service pistols of the three Caloocan policemen — PO3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda and PO1 Jerwin Cruz — as well as a .45 cal. pistol found at the scene had been fired.

Public outrage over the murder of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos has prompted calls for justice for other youngsters killed in the Duterte administration’s war on drugs.
Investigations of these cases, perpetrated either by lawmen or vigilantes and hidden from media spotlight, have grounded to a halt for a host of reasons, like fear of reprisals, lack of witnesses and plain lack of interest by local authorities, according to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).

Like an altar with a crucifix and rosaries hanging on the picture frames, the table occupies a corner in the family’s 12-square-meter home occupied by the girl’s coffin during her wake six months ago.
A stray bullet hit Kristine in an attack that killed Allan Fernandez, a suspected drug dealer in their community. It happened in a church compound where the girl was attending a dawn Mass with her family, four days before Christmas. 
“I still remember her watching TV from morning till noon. She would sit around with her cousins, teasing her older brother. She was a cheerful girl,” said Sailog, 40, a seasonal construction worker.
Sailog said he had yet to hear from the police about their inquiry into his child’s death.
The war on drugs has claimed the lives of several thousands in police operations or vigilante violence.
Calabarzon deaths
In the Calabarzon region (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon), police records as of June showed 373 drug suspects were killed allegedly while resisting arrest and engaging policemen in a shootout.

Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa has commended the Calabarzon police for carrying out the most number of antidrug operations in the country that had resulted in the arrest of 15,580 suspects and the surrender of 144,726 others.
“We too were surprised by what was happening. We were not ready for that,” Dr. Rio Magpantay of the Department of Health said of the number who had surrendered in an area with little facility for drug treatment.
There was another youngster killed in Cebu province.
Stray bullet
Wilson Batucan recalled that his 7-year-old son Niño was watching television in their house in Barangay Cansaga, Consolacion town, last Dec. 3 when he was killed by a stray bullet fired by a group of bonnet-wearing men who were chasing a teenage boy accused of selling drugs.
The father cried for justice, claiming that his son’s killers were policemen.
Batucan himself was killed on March 8 in an attack by still unidentified gunmen while he was about to park his motorcycle outside his house.
He had confided to his wife before the incident that he had turned down an offer to settle his son’s case in exchange for money.
His wife, Marilou, 45, said she wanted justice for her husband and son but had decided to remain silent to protect her other children and relatives.
No complaints


Many families of those killed by unknown assailants and police officers in the war on drugs have chosen not to file any complaints for similar reasons, according to CHR’s Edgar Luis.
“All the investigations we are doing are motu proprio (by the agency’s own initiative) because no one is interested or willing to file a complaint or seek an investigation,” Luis said.
The CHR is investigating 21 cases of suspected extrajudicial killings in Western Visayas and 59 cases in Central Visayas involving either policemen or operatives of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. These cases have been elevated to the Office of the Ombudsman.
One of the cases involved the killing of Jerald Inesola, 22, who was picked up from his house in Cebu City and was later killed in what the police claimed was a shootout on July 23, 2016.
The CHR has filed a complaint in connection with the case against SPO2 Renante Nioda and PO2 Arnold Cabildo at the Office of the Ombudsman.
Snail-paced probe
Nicolasa Inesola, 72, a rice cake vendor, said the family was dismayed by the snail-paced investigation. She and her daughter had traveled to Manila to pursue the case.
“We spent for it, but we just could not travel to Manila regularly because the fare was expensive,” Inesola said.
“I want those two policemen to rot in jail. How could they kill my grandson? They don’t have any right to do so even granting that he committed a mistake,” she said as tears welled up in his eyes. —With reports from Nestor P. Burgos and Leo Udtohan

ILOILO CITY – Senator Franklin Drilon on Friday reiterated his call for the Ombudsman to conduct the investigation into the killing of Kian Loyd delos Santos instead of the Department of Justice (DOJ).
“It is obvious that (Secretary of Justice Vitaliano Aguirre) is biased. From the totality of his statements, he tends to protect the policemen rather than project impartiality,” Drilon told reporters here referring to Aguirre’s testimony on Thursday at a hearing of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs.

“After the hearing, we cannot expect the DOJ to remain impartial. That is why in the name of justice, Aguirre should let the Ombudsman conduct the preliminary investigation,” Drilon said later in a statement.
“For obvious reasons, Aguirre declined, and wants to control the preliminary investigation,” the senator said.FEATURED STORIES

Policemen under the Caloocan City police are being investigated for the killing of the 17-year-old boy which the police claimed to be a shootout during a drug raid.
The killing has been met with widespread anger and criticism after security camera footage and witnesses supposedly showed that Delos Santos was arrested, beaten and summary killed by policemen. 
Drilon criticized Aguirre for refusing to allow the Ombudsman to conduct the investigation.
“He said no because he was more concerned with the image with DOJ (rather) than the image that the rule of law is the primary consideration in this investigation,” the senator told reporters.
He cited the statements of Caloocan City prosecutor Darwin Cañete which he said showed partiality for the policemen.
“You cannot help but conclude that the scale of the justice system is tilted in favor of the policemen rather than being neutral and impartial and (to) seek the truth,” Drilon said.
Asked to comment on criticisms that the opposition Liberal Party which he belongs is capitalizing on the issue, Drilon said: “Let the public judge.”

Drilon pointed out that the condemnation on what had happened to Delos Santos has been “universal” which no single group could influence.
He said the condemnation was also because of the details coming out that Delos Santos was defenseless and he was killed on flimsy grounds.
He cited the testimony of the policemen in the Senate hearing that they only found a witness who alleged that Delos Santos was a drug courier a day after he was killed.
One of the policemen had said in the hearing they also got information against Delos Santos from social media.
“But even if (Delos Santos) was involved in illegal drugs activity, is it correct to just shoot him? Tama ba ‘yon (Is that right)?” Drilon said in the press conference.

If the confessional in Catholic churches could speak, they would reveal the horrors of the word “nanlaban (fought back).”
Bishop Pablo Virgilio David of Caloocan City said people afraid to go public had turned to the confessional to disclose how some suspects had been killed in cold blood during police operations.

“We have been hearing the reaction of people on those who fought back in police operations. There are witnesses in many instances in which the suspects did not fight back but were nevertheless killed,” David said.
“Unfortunately, they are afraid to testify. They could only say it in confession,” he said. “When we advise them to come out and testify, the most common response is ‘What about my family? We might be harmed.’”FEATURED STORIES

Confidentiality
The confidentiality guaranteed by the seal of confession prohibits David from further discussing what the witnesses had told the priests. 
This was why, David said, he was glad that witnesses had come to testify against the Caloocan policemen who killed 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in Barangay 160 last week.
According to David, the cities in his archdiocese—Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas — have been “turned into killing fields” in the war on drugs.
“For the first time, because of the outpouring of support, families have summoned the courage to file a case and for witnesses to testify. I am happy that government agencies are now helping to resolve the case,” he said.

Yebra’s report said Escuadro was on the drug watch list of the Pasig police.
In an interview on Saturday, Escuadro’s uncle Cesar admitted that his nephew had used drugs for about four years. 
Escuadro was briefly jailed in Cainta, Rizal, in February this year for a drug-related offense, Cesar recalled. To raise money for his bail, his family had to pawn their house.
Cesar believed that his nephew was targeted for a vigilante-style attack because of his history of drug use. But he maintained that Escuadro was already a changed man after spending time in jail and later going to Pangasinan province to “recover.”
He said Escuadro chose not to enter Pasig’s own recovery program for drug users because “the attendees were being marked.”
“After they attended the first and second sessions, I noticed that those who missed [the next sessions] were killed,” Cesar said.
“I was hoping that my nephew would not be killed because he was already changing,” he said. “I never realized that losing a family member this way would be this painful. He should have been given another chance. There was no need to kill him.”

He said Mariano, Escuadro’s partner, worked in a garments factory and was not known to take drugs. But she still ended up dead as collateral damage –  “nadamay lang.”
Also in Pasig, another man on the police watch list was shot and wounded by an unidentified assailant around 6:15 p.m. Friday.
Yebra said Rodel Odang, 40, was standing on Manga Extension in Barangay Kalawaan when he was shot in the neck.
Odang remained in critical condition at a Pasig hospital as of this posting. /atm

Photo by Vince F. Nonato.
The Integrated Bar of the Philippines has filed a criminal and administrative complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman against six Caloocan City policemen over the August 16 killing of 17-year-old student Kian Loyd delos Santos.
Caloocan City police superiors, led by relieved Northern Police District head Police Chief Supt. Roberto Fajardo, were blamed in the 13-page complaint filed Monday for failing to “inculcate a respect for basic human rights in their subordinates.”

Instead of taking corrective action, the IBP said PCSupt. Fajardo and other higher-ups even “tried to justify” the legal and procedural violations of law “by accusing Kian and members of his family of being involved in the drug trade.”
IBP National President Abdiel Dan Fajardo, who heads the country’s mandatory bar organization, sought administrative charges for grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty for “blatant violations” of Philippine National Police operational procedures.FEATURED STORIES

Besides PCSupt. Fajardo, the other respondents were Police Senior Supt. Chito Bersaluna, Police Chief Insp. Amor Cerillo, Police Officer 3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda, and PO1 Jerwin Cruz. Asset Nono Lubiras as well as unidentified John Does were also named as respondents.
The complaint was based on the IBP’s interviews with the three eyewitnesses who are under Senate custody and protection. Their names were redacted from the copy of the complaint furnished to reporters. 
Although the Office of the Ombudsman has commenced a motu proprio investigation without any complaint being filed yet, Atty. Fajardo said the IBP’s filing of the complaint should hasten the process of indicting the police officers and dismissing them from government service.
“The IBP hopes that with these affidavits of the witnesses, the Ombudsman can now proceed with the investigation and assume jurisdiction and file the information for murder, etc., against the respondents and remove from office the higher-ups for gross neglect of duty,” he told reporters in an interview.
Although the Department of Justice is also tackling separate complaints by the Public Attorney’s Office and the National Bureau of Investigation, Atty. Fajardo also said the IBP believed that “with respect to the accountability of public officers, the superior office is always the Office of the Ombudsman.”
“Anytime the Ombudsman can always assume jurisdiction if the respondent is a public official regardless of the offense, in relation to his functions,” Atty. Fajardo said.
Failure to enforce compliance
ADVERTISEMENT
 


 
Higher-ups PCSupt. Fajardo, Bersaluna and Cerillo were faulted for the alleged failure to enforce compliance with PNP procedures and instill respect for human rights, which the IBP president said constituted gross neglect of duty.
The complaint also cited the doctrine of command responsibility under Executive Order No. 226, s. 1995., which presumes a PNP commander has knowledge of irregularities and criminal offenses when they become widespread or regularly committed especially by immediate staff.
Yet, PCSupt. Fajardo and Bersaluna accused Delos Santos of being a drug seller in an Aug. 21 press conference. The complaint also cited Bersaluna’s admission in an Aug. 24 Senate hearing that their only basis for the claim was “social media.”
The IBP said even if Delos Santos’ family indeed dealt with illegal drugs, it did not justify his murder as well as the “utter failure” of the policemen to respect basic constitutional rights and comply with PNP operational procedures.
For their part, Oares, Pereda and Cruz, as well as an unidentified companion, failed to take Delos Santos to a police station for investigation and disposition, as well as apprise him of his constitutional rights, take photographs, conduct an inventory of evidence and present him for drug testing.
“Considering that the Respondents disguised the wanton killing of a minor as a legitimate police operation, it is submitted that this constitutes corruption as well as a clear intent to violate the law,” read the complaint filed by Atty. Fajardo on behalf of the IBP.
Criminal offenses
 
Besides the administrative offenses, Atty. Fajardo also sought criminal charges against Oares, Pereda, Cruz and Lubiras—who were more directly implicated in the killing—for murder, child abuse, violation of domicile and planting of evidence.


The policemen allegedly committed murder because Delos Santos was outnumbered and “had no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate against three (perhaps four) armed police officers.”
Bringing along their purported asset and fellow respondent Nono Lubiran also showed the policemen’s purpose of identifying a target and pursuing a “pre-determined and deliberate plan of action.”
A witness, whose name was redacted in the copy released to reporters, also saw the policemen force Delos Santos to hold the .45-caliber pistol eventually found in his body.
The same witness saw the policemen frisk the teenager and find nothing, which the IBP said “logically” meant the shabu (crystal meth) found in his body could only have been placed there by the officers.
This was in violation of Sections 3(cc) and 29 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act and Section 38 of the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act which penalize the planting of evidence.
Asked in the interview if the case could also involve even higher officials at the national headquarters, Atty. Fajardo said the IBP could only implicate local district policemen on the basis of the available testimonies.
“It all depends on the Ombudsman now, because the IBP does not have the awesome powers the Ombudsman has,” he said.

According to an autopsy, Carl Angelo Arnaiz, a 19 year-old student of the University of the Philippines was shot five times — three shots in the chest, one in his left side, and one in his right arm.
The Caloocan City police officers who shot him said Arnaiz had robbed a taxi driver and fought back as they were trying to arrest him

On Monday, Dr. Erwin Erfe, who led the forensic team from the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO), said two of the teenager’s wounds in the chest indicated he was kneeling when shot. He had a wound on his right arm probably because he tried to block the shot. The rest of the shots were made while the victim was already on the ground.
Erfe said the three shots to the chest were grouping shots that targeted the heart and its vessels.FEATURED STORIES

President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered police to let journalists join raids in his crackdown on illegal drugs to disprove growing allegations of extrajudicial killings, but he warned reporters they could get shot.

Duterte issued the order in a news conference late Tuesday after a televised Senate investigation into the allegations, during which Director General Ronald dela Rosa, chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), wept over what he said was his exasperation over unfair allegations against his men.
“Now, this is an order: Bring the media and let them go first so that they can get the story from the beginning to the end,” Duterte said, explaining that when journalists are called in when a gunbattle is over, they’ll say, “Ah, they just dumped the guns on the suspects.”FEATURED STORIES

“If you get shot, will you still believe that those [suspects] have no guns? Go ahead,” the president said, adding that journalists should take positions beside law enforcers during raids on suspected drug dealers’ hideouts.
Duterte’s crackdown, which has left thousands of suspects dead and horrified human rights groups, came under renewed scrutiny after police gunned down a 17-year-old student, Kian Loyd delos Santos, during a raid in a slum in Caloocan City last month. 
Police said Delos Santos was a drug dealer who fired at officers during the raid, but his family and witnesses testified in official investigations, including in the Senate, that he was shot in a dark alley as he pleaded for his life.
Witnesses pointed to evidence, including a village security video, which they said showed two police officers dragging away the teenager shortly before shots rang out and he was found fatally shot in the head, holding a pistol with his left hand although his parent said he was right-handed.
The police officers testified in the Senate that delos Santos was not the man seen being dragged in the video, although several witnesses doubted the police statement.
Murder and torture complaints have been filed against three police officers and their commander in the Aug. 16 shooting of Delos Santos.
Amid a growing outcry, Duterte has said the officers will end up in jail if they killed Delos Santos. He also met the student’s grieving parents to express his condolences.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Duterte has recently been clearer in warning officers they will face the law if they are found to have carried out extrajudicial killings. Before, he promised to defend police from lawsuits and grant them a presidential pardon if they are convicted of any crimes while fighting illegal drugs.
Delos Santos’s death was followed by another outcry over the killing of Carl Angelo Arnaiz, a 19-year-old who police said was killed when he shot it out with police after robbing a taxi driver last month.
Dr. Erwin Erfe, a forensic expert of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) said, however, that Arnaiz apparently was handcuffed, tortured and shot five times, causing his death.
Arnaiz’s parents say he went out with a friend to buy a snack late at night but never returned home. They found him in a morgue 10 days later, but his 14-year-old friend remains missing. Arnaiz was buried Tuesday.
Duterte has stressed his administration does not condone extrajudicial killings, although he has repeatedly threatened drug suspects with death in the past. He sounded astonished over the outcry over the deaths of delos Santos and Arnaiz.
“Two killings make it a policy of the Republic of the Philippines?” Duterte asked. “Why would we kill the innocent?” /atm

Gutierrez had just been released from jail on illegal gambling charges, Garcia added.
A witness who asked not to be identified described the gunmen as dressed in police uniforms. 
“They were wearing blue, those used by police. They were tall and had muscular bodies,” he said.
“I thought they would just scare them but one of them fired at [Gutierrez]. When the two others ran away, they were chased and also shot,” he added.
Scene of the Crime Operatives recovered at least 16 shells from a 9mm firearm.
The Makati police chief, Senior Supt. Jerry Umayao, however, denied that the gunmen were his men. He also said that there were no operations conducted by the police in La Paz that night except for “regular police patrolling.”
He added that the witness may have just been “riding on the bandwagon of public outrage” following reports that policemen were involved in the killings of teenagers Kian Loyd delos Santos and Carl Angelo Arnaiz in Caloocan City.

“It’s hard to believe that my men in uniform would just shoot three people. Makati streets are full of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras,” he added.
Barangay La Paz chair Ferdinand Concepcion, however, said the two CCTV cameras in the area stopped working before the shooting happened.
Two watchmen on duty “may have pressed the wrong button,” causing the CCTV cameras to stop recording, he explained. He said he would have both suspended.
According to Concepcion, the wife of Gutierrez told him that a Manila policeman had apprehended her husband last Sunday for being “maangas (cocky).”
The policeman reportedly warned Gutierrez, “Get yourself together if you don’t want to die.”

“He was not friendly. He only had a few close friends. After his classes, he always went straight home. He only left our house when there was something important he had to do,” she said.
After he was reported missing for days, Bagcal surfaced on Sunday and said that he had sought refuge from the human rights group Rise Up for Life and for Rights after sensing threats to his life. 
He was initially reluctant to identify Arnaiz as the person who held him up but the 54-year-old cabbie eventually confirmed that the teenager was indeed the one who pointed a gun at him and took his wallet.
Bagcal, however, stressed that Arnaiz was still alive when he took him to a police station on 9th Avenue in Caloocan City.
This contradicted two policemen’s claim that the teenager had fired at them during a chase, leading to a shootout which left him dead.
Eva expressed confidence that Bagcal’s testimony would be a big help in pursuing criminal cases against the two police officers.
Bagcal is expected to go to the Senate on Tuesday to attend a hearing on the killing of Arnaiz and two other minors, Kian Loyd delos Santos and Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman.

“He will appear, he will cooperate,” Rise Up convenor Nardy Sabino said in a phone interview.
“As he said before, Bagcal wants to help resolve Carl’s case. He wants to shed light and show the people what he (Bagcal) went through,” Sabino added.
Based on the two affidavits Bagcal submitted to the Caloocan police homicide section, Arnaiz was killed in a shootout with Police Officers 1 Jefrey Perez and Ricky Arquilito. The cab driver, however, said on Sunday that he had nothing to do with the affidavits.
He also pointed out that while Arnaiz had indeed robbed him, the police chase and shootout was “scripted” and “staged.”
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, the chair of the Senate committee which is conducting the hearing, said that a witness claimed he saw Arnaiz and a child inside a police car hours before the former was killed.
“The witness told my staff he could not sleep and that was why he went to my office because he kept on dreaming of the way he and Carl looked at each other,” Lacson said.

Arnaiz was with 14-year-old De Guzman when he left their house in Cainta, Rizal, on Aug. 17, shortly before he supposedly held up Bagcal.
Malacañang has welcomed Bagcal’s decision to come forward and reveal what he knows of Arnaiz’s killing.
Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Monday that Bagcal’s testimony should help bring justice to the boy.
“We look forward to Mr. Tomas Bagcal’s cooperation with authorities as he willingly expressed during his press conference,” Abella told reporters. —WITH AIE BALAGTAS SEE, PHILIP C. TUBEZA AND JHESSET O. ENANO

“Based on the results obtained the source of the DNA profile obtained from the male [corpse, it] cannot be the biological offspring of Eduardo Gabriel and Nina de Guzman,” PNP Deputy Director General for Operations Fernando Mendez told reporters.

Insp. Lorna Santos, chief of the PNP DNA Laboratory, said the result of the DNA test was “99.9 percent accurate.”
Mendez said the PNP tried to reach the De Guzmans but “apparently the numbers that they gave [had been] changed or could not be contacted.”FEATURED STORIES

For the PNP, he said, De Guzman is now technically a “missing” person.
He said the PNP would continue to investigate the boy’s case. 
De Guzman, 14, was the last known companion of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, who was killed by police in an supposed exchange of gunfire after a taxi robbery in Caloocan City last month.
The body supposedly of De Guzman was found with 26 stab wounds in a creek in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija province, last week.
Gabriel, who traveled to Gapan to bring home the body of his son, said on Monday he could not believe the PNP announcement about the DNA test.
He demanded another test.
Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) chief Persida Rueda-Acosta said the positive identification of the body by the parents outweighed the PNP findings.

Acosta said somebody was trying to mar the investigation of the boy’s killing.
Mendez said the PNP had no idea whose body was found in the Gapan creek.
Quoting the Nueva Ecija police, he said there was no missing person on record in the province.
Contrary to that claim, three people were reported missing in Nueva Ecija before the boy’s body was found: Jayson Flores, 25, of Santa Rita, Cabiao town; Joyland Lucero, 38, of San Antonio town, and Shibani Paul Garcia, a Grade 11 student from Cabanatuan City.
Flores has been missing since Sept. 5. Both Lucero and Garcia have been missing since Sept. 4.
Santos said the PNP crime laboratory in Nueva Ecija requested the DNA test.
She said the boy’s parents gave a sample through a cheek swab.
The police also took a sample from the corpse, she said.
Santos described the sample taken from the body as “good.”
She said the PNP leadership directed the crime laboratory to expedite the test. She added that the PNP had state-of-the-art technology in DNA testing.


Santos said she was aware that the public was skeptical about the result of the DNA test, but that she stood by its integrity.
To dispel any doubts, she suggested tests by other parties.
Supt. Peter Madria, Gapan police chief, confirmed that it was he who requested the DNA test.
“Yes, I made the request because that was the standard operating procedure. But if I am not entitled to the results of the test, that would be OK,” Madria said.
He said he requested the test on Sept. 6, when the boy’s parents claimed the body.
Chief Supt. Amador Corpus, Central Luzon Police director, said the crime laboratory took samples from the body to help in the investigation and because the surnames of the parents were different from the boy’s.
The boy took the surname of his grandmother.
The forensic expert of the PAO said on Monday his office would conduct physical profiling on the body that was fished out of a creek in Nueva Ecija.
Dr. Erwin Erfe, PAO forensic laboratory director, said he stood by the parents’ claim that the boy was their son.
In a phone interview with Inquirer, Erfe said the DNA test result may not be “conclusive,” as several factors could affect tests.


“Factors include sample collection from the subject and the transport, as well as the processing in the laboratory itself,” he said. “You also have to consider the interpretation [of their experts].”

(Updated, this story was first published at 10:23 a.m.) Threats to the security of the family of Reynaldo “Kulot” De Guzman marred the boy’s funeral as police authorities continued to question the identity of the body buried in Pasig City on Wednesday.

De Guzman, whose identity was put into question after the Philippine National Police (PNP) released its test claiming the body’s DNA sample did not match those of his parents, was buried in a hasty funeral ceremony in Pasig City because of threats to his family’s security.
“Ang gusto namin secure talaga, mahirap na, baka masingitan kami (We want to make sure that they are secure and not leave anything to chance),” Witness Protection Program’s Intelligence Service Operations Group (Isog) Chief Ernie Talabucon told the media after De Guzman’s burial.FEATURED STORIES

“Kasi kahapon nagkatensyon, diba, sa CIDG? (There was tension with the CIDG yesterday, right?)”
READ: Kulot’s family under tight security 
Talabucon, however, did not say whether the threat to the security of the boy’s family came from the CIDG.
The contention on the body’s identity led to the CIDG’s attempt to take the body from its wake on Tuesday. The parents refused to give the body, which then led to a commotion.
De Guzman’s parents, Eduardo Gabriel and Lina De Guzman, however, insisted it was their son because of his wart on his left knee and the scar on his neck.
“Anak namin ‘yan, dugo’t laman namin ‘yan. Kami gumawa niyan, sa amin ‘yan (That’s our son, our own flesh and blood. We made him, he’s ours),” Lina told the press.

The whole funeral ceremony lasted for about an hour and a half: the convoy began at De Guzman’s neighborhood in Anak Pawis 2, Cainta, Rizal at around 8:30 a.m. and ended at around 10 a.m. at the Pasig City Public Cemetery where he was buried in an apartment-style crypt.
A brief eulogy was held at the San Antonio Abad Parish in Maybunga, Pasig City.
The family no longer observed burial customs at the cemetery, such as the placing of flowers at the crypt and the “tawid (cross),” where children are crossed over the casket.
The kin immediately left in a van and proceeded to the Department of Justice to be formally admitted to the WPP.
Justice
In his homily, parish priest Fr. Jun Sanchez called for justice for the slain teen as he urged the country’s leaders to stop politicking and instead focus on the pressing issues the country face.
“Sa ating mga lider, sana po iwasan na ang pamumulitika, tapos na ang kampanya, tapos na ang eleksyon, marami po tayong problemang dapat harapin,” Sanchez said.
(To our leaders, please refrain from politicking; the campaign and election were over. We have more problems to face.)
The Church is also open to all those who need help, the priest said.
De Guzman was found Sept. 5 floating in Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in the village of San Roque in Gapan City. His body was riddled with 30 stab wounds and his head was wrapped in a plastic and packing tape.


A Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) autopsy report indicated De Guzman was killed within 24 hours before he was dumped into the creek.
He was last seen on Aug. 18 with another slain teen, 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, when they went out for midnight snacks.
Arnaiz was found dead 10 days later in a morgue in Caloocan City, killed in an alleged shootout with the police after mugging taxi driver Tomas Bagcal.
The boys’ deaths, including that of another teen, Kian delos Santos, have sparked public outrage and have incited more criticisms into Duterte’s violent crackdown against drugs, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of suspected drug personalities. /idl

The body of a boy fished out of a creek in Nueva Ecija province last week was buried on Wednesday amid doubts that he was Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman, who may have witnessed the killing of an alleged  robber by police in Caloocan City last month.
“He is really our son. He looks like his father,” said Lina de Guzman, wife of Eduardo Gabriel, who identified the body in a funeral parlor in Gapan City on Sept. 5 as that of his 14-year-old son, Reynaldo.

For identification
A report spread on Tuesday that officers from the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) went to the wake for the boy in Cainta, Rizal province, to get the body. 
But Chief Supt. Dionardo Carlos explained on Wednesday that the CIDG team went to the wake only to examine the body for identification, not to get it.
When the parents refused, the team withdrew, Carlos said.
He said the PNP respected the family’s decision to bury the body, but added: “At the end of the day, we have the mandate to investigate the case, particularly who he is. He also has a family.”
Carlos said the PNP would look at the place where the body was buried and make sure it was really there—in case it would be “needed in the ongoing investigation.”
‘Missing person’

On the request of Gapan police, the PNP Crime Laboratory conducted a DNA test on the boy’s body and returned a report on Monday that the body was not that of the Gabriel couple’s son Reynaldo.
The PNP then declared Reynaldo de Guzman a “missing person.”
The parents rejected the PNP finding and refused a second test.
Persida Rueda-Acosta, chief of the Public Attorney’s Office, said the National Bureau of Investigation had done a DNA test on the body and found that it was the couple’s son.
The boy was the last known companion of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, whom police said they killed in an exchange of gunfire after the former University of the Philippines student robbed a taxi driver in Caloocan on Aug. 18.
But the taxi driver, Tomas Bagcal, told a news conference on Sunday that he caught Arnaiz with the help of bystanders and took him to the police station on 9th Avenue alive.
Justice for victims
Bagcal did not mention De Guzman.
The body found in the Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in Gapan bore 26 stab wounds, and Gabriel said he recognized it as his son’s because of familiar marks.
De Guzman, Arnaiz and 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos, whom Caloocan police shot dead in a drug raid on Aug. 16, were the latest victims in President Duterte’s fierce campaign again drugs and crime.


During the Mass held at San Antonio Abad Parish Church before De Guzman’s burial in Pasig Public Cemetery on Wednesday morning, Fr. Loreto Sanchez Jr. demanded justice for the boy and other victims of the crackdown.
Sanchez also excoriated the country’s leaders for playing politics for personal gain.
“To our leaders, I hope you avoid politicking. The campaign and the elections are over. There are now many issues we need to face,” Sanchez said in his homily.
He also urged those present to pray for innocent victims of Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, saying one death in a family is a loss for all families.
“The Church will continue to advocate for the value of each life,” Sanchez said, adding that keeping quiet is cowardice.
He said he hoped the killers of De Guzman would feel remorse and turn themselves in for a “chance to renew themselves.”

The parents of a 16-year-old boy who has been missing for nearly three weeks are certain that a decomposing body found in a stream in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, is that of their son, Michael Angelo Remecio.
Remecio’s mother, Genevie, 39, said he left their house in Barangay 176, Caloocan City, at 9 p.m. on Aug. 25, hoping to make some money by driving a tricycle. When he failed to come home, she filed a missing persons report with barangay officials on Sept. 1.

At 3:20 p.m. Wednesday, a male body was found in a stream at Evergreen Subdivision, Barangay Gaya-Gaya in SJDM by scavengers who noticed a foul smell.
The body was in such a bad state, making it impossible to make out any identifying marks or features, SPO1 Edcel Israel, commander of SJDM’s Police Community Precinct 2, told the Inquirer on Thursday.FEATURED STORIES

The only thing they were certain of was that the victim was male. He was wearing a black shirt and basketball shorts and his hands had been tied together with a nylon cord.
When Genevie and her husband, Dionisio, learned about the discovery, they went to Bulacan that same afternoon and through the clothes on the body, positively identified him as their missing son. 
Israel said it was possible that the body was dumped elsewhere and carried downstream by the current, only to surface after floods caused by Tropical Depression “Maring” subsided. He confirmed that the stream where the victim was found passes through Caloocan City.
Should the body be proven to be Remicio’s, he would be the third teenager killed under mysterious circumstances in Caloocan City last month after 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos and 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz.
For now, the body remains at a funeral home in SJDM pending the results of an autopsy and a DNA test.
Remecio’s parents said they could not think of a possible motive for their son’s killing as Genevie described him as a selfless, helpful teenager who enjoyed making friends.
“He became a tricycle driver because he wanted to help us,” she told the Inquirer.

Remecio, whose decomposing body was recovered by scavengers in a stream in San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan, on Sept. 13, was buried on Sunday after his body was autopsied by members of the PAO forensic team.
Acosta said the forensics experts helped the boy’s mother, Genevie, and his father, Dionisio, identify their son as the state of the body made it hard to make out identifying marks or features. 
“Based on our forensics report, the parents positively identified the cadaver as that of their son because he had a previous appendectomy and an injury on the left elbow,” she added.
Remecio was last seen alive when he left their house in Barangay 176, Caloocan City on the night of Aug. 25. He told his mother he would drive a tricycle to earn some money.
The police had said the teenager’s death might be linked to the illegal drug trade or a possible “love triangle.”
Earlier, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) relieved the entire Caloocan police force following the deaths of Delos Santos, Arnaiz, De Guzman and the conduct of an illegal house raid on Sept. 7.
Just last month, the NCRPO named the city police force the best in Metro Manila.

Cruz said the Philippine National Police did not spend a single centavo for the cameras since these were donated by his friends from Metro Manila.
“These body cameras will be used during our antidrug operations and other [anticrime operations]. This will dispel allegations that the police are committing abuses, planting of evidence and even [resorting to] EJK (extrajudicial killings),” Cruz said during an interview. 
“We want to be transparent in our operations. We want to provide protection both to our policemen and the suspects,” he said.
Offices that did not receive any camera were required to record their operations using their mobile phone cameras, he said.
Cruz also encouraged members of the media to join their operations so they could witness “the risks and sacrifices being made by policemen.”
Cruz said he expected that another set of 30 cameras would be distributed to other police stations in the region, which has 121 police stations.

Fifteen Liberal Party (LP) lawmakers from a pro-Duterte coalition of parties in the House of Representatives met with Vice President Leni Robredo on Wednesday, agreeing to block all attempts to impeach her, one of the LP members said yesterday.
Deputy Speaker Miro Quimbo, a ranking LP leader, said the consensus was reached when the LP members met with Robredo at her office in Quezon City.

He said the LP members also had pledged their “strongest commitment of support” to Robredo, currently LP chair.
Robredo had drawn the ire of supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte after she sent a video message to a United Nations event raising alarm over extrajudicial killings linked to Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

Quimbo said the threat of impeachment hanging over Robredo and Mr. Duterte was among the topics of the meeting at Robredo’s office.
In a statement, Quimbo said devoting the House’s time to “any impeachment complaint today will only be divisive.” 
“It will only serve to distract us from the many important matters that Congress should be giving priority to,” Quimbo said.
He said the LP members “categorically took a position that we will not support any of the impeachment complaints filed against the leaders of the land.” Quimbo did not mention Mr. Duterte’s name in the statement, though.
At least 32 House members still belong to LP, the party in power during the Aquino administration. Five of them had formed an independent opposition bloc.
In March, an impeachment complaint was filed against Mr. Duterte by Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano, accusing the President of the mass murder of thousands of drug suspects, amassing P2.2 billion in unexplained wealth and absconding on his duty to defend Philippine territory against China.
Robredo’s video message to the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotics Drugs became public on the same day Alejano’s complaint was filed.

Marcos loyalists, led by lawyer Oliver Lozano, filed an impeachment complaint against Robredo at the Speaker’s office for endorsement. Another group is building a case against her.
Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, a bosom buddy of Mr. Duterte, expressed support for the impeachment complaint against Robredo.
Robredo confirmed the meeting with the 15 LP members.
“They said they agreed among themselves that they will protect me,” she said in a transcript of an interview sent by her staffers.
Robredo said she would discuss the matter with more LP members soon but said there is no plan, yet, for LP members to bolt the pro-Duterte coalition in the House.

Abella’s statement came after the United States expressed concern over the rising cases of alleged extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.
US Assistant Secretary of State for Southeast Asia Patrick Murphy has told a press briefing in Washington that the US government supports the Philippines’ war on drugs but was troubled at the growing cases of killings in the country. 
“We, however, do have a very sustained and deep concern when elements of the drug war are operating outside the rule of law,” Murphy said. “The growing number of extrajudicial killings is troubling.”
Abella responded by saying local authorities were following “operational protocols” in carrying out the government’s war on drugs.
“We share the concern of US Assistant Secretary of State for Southeast Asia Patrick Murphy, who has been quoted in the media saying that ‘there are elements of the drug war that are operating outside the rule of law’,” he said.
“Local authorities follow operational protocols and the proper enforcement of our laws requires the use of reasonable force merited by the attendant circumstances,” he added.
The Palace official assured that law enforcers who abuse their authority would be dealt with properly.

“Those who breach procedures are made to answer before the law.  The Philippine National Police has an Internal Affairs Service (IAS) tasked to probe police accused of such violations,” he said.
The IAS, he said, could suspend or dismiss PNP personnel based on violations incurred and could recommend the filing of criminal charges.  
Abella sought for fairness amid widespread criticism of government’s deadly war on drugs.
“We expect fairness and not a rush to judgment. Right now the people appreciate the changes and the way these are carried out,” he said.

TAGUM CITY, Davao del Norte – The military denied on Tuesday allegations it was behind the killing of three farmers in Laak, Compostela Valley, even as it dared its accusers to file charges.
Maj. Ezra Balagtey, spokesperson of the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom), said government troops could not have been behind the murder of farmers Cora Lina (not Molina as earlier reported), and couple Arman and Arlyn Almonicar, as “it is the mandate of the military to protect innocent civilians.”

The victims, all members of the militant Nagkahiusang Mag-uuma sa Laak (United Farmers of Laak or Namulak) were gunned down by suspected agents of the Philippine Army’s 60th Infantry Battalion late on Monday, said Jay Apiag, spokesperson of Karapatan Southern Mindanao.
The 45-year-old Lina was shot dead by an unknown assailant at her house in Kibaguio village around 3 p.m., Apiag said.FEATURED STORIES

Some four hours later, the Almonicars were shot dead by unidentified attackers near their home in Purok (Community) 2, Bollukan village, he added.
He said Lina had been receiving threats from the military and had been summoned many times to the 60IB camp. 
“She had also been vilified as a sympathizer of the (New People’s Army),” the rights group spokesperson said.
Balagtey lamented that Karapatan conveniently accused the military of the murders “without even providing proof or evidence.”
“It is our duty to protect the people and that killing innocent civilians is a criminal act,” the regional army spokesperson said.
Maj. Michael Candole, 60IB executive officer, said they had no knowledge of the killings.
He said the military could not have done that “because our job is to protect lives and property.”

“We even gave medical attention to wounded NPA rebels captured during encounters. Killing civilians is for terrorists and traitors. It could be the handiwork of the rebels themselves,” Candole said.
Apiag said they have documented 16 cases of political killings in Southern Mindanao under the nine-month old Duterte administration.
“And none of these cases was acted upon or investigated,” he said.  SFM/rga

(First of two parts)
When Rodrigo Duterte came to power last year, he launched a brutal war on illegal drugs. But more than 8,000 deaths later, the stories of children caught in the web of daily violence stand out as a sobering reminder that the menace cannot be stopped by bullets alone.

Matthew learned it the hard way. At 13, he is a veteran of Manila’s mean streets, having quit school four years earlier to peddle crystal meth, or “shabu,” with his friends.
He earned a third for every sale he made—as much as P200 in commission, or about half of the average daily wage in Manila—cautiously ignoring a public threat by President Duterte that he would kill drug pushers and addicts, and dump their bodies in Manila Bay for the fish to eat.FEATURED STORIES

Last August, a month after Mr. Duterte took office, Matthew was picked up by police officers, beaten and shot. But he survived to tell his story.
“They would have killed him,” said a social worker at a city social welfare and development center who took him in. “Had he not been that strong, he would have died. That pains us.” 
The Inquirer is withholding the center’s name and Matthew’s real identity to protect them from reprisal. The facility prepares children in conflict with the law for reintegration into society.
Describing his terrible ordeal in the hands of police, Matthew said he was kept in jail for days.
“They arrested me. The police officer told me to run, so I ran very fast. I thought he was letting me go. But he shot me. I was knocked out,” he said.
When he came to, he said, he was in the police vehicle and saw his mother trying to come near him. “The cop pinned my head with his foot and threatened to shoot my mother if I would not tell her to leave,” he said.
Matthew said he was being filmed as he writhed in pain.

He was turned over to the police station’s narcotics unit, where he was held for several days. “I know what I did was wrong. But I still don’t understand why he shot me,” he said.
Matthew was healing fast at the city social welfare center.
The boy said he peddled drugs to survive, using his earnings to buy clothes and food for his family. He lives with his 73-year-old grandfather, a delivery man, and an uncle who is mentally ill.
His father, a drug user, is in hiding, social workers said.
Matthew said he had been selling drugs for three months, but refused to divulge his source. “The members of my group are also my friends, and they give me food. We are happy together,” he said.
“Two of my friends were killed by policemen. I was frightened, too,” he said.
A companion, who was arrested with him, was also shot and wounded. He is being held in a jail in another city.
The police investigator in Matthew’s case said the boy was arrested with an adult man.
Contradicting Matthew’s statement, the investigator said the boy was accidentally shot when his companion tried to escape and grabbed an officer’s gun. The man was subdued and detained.
Matthew was detained for five days as he recuperated, while the older suspect was detained for more than 10 days with a bullet in his buttocks.


The Manila police station said four other minors had been killed since Matthew was taken in, mostly by unidentified gunmen.
A 17-year-old suspected drug pusher was also shot dead in a gunfight with police.

Six other children, including a toddler, were wounded when suspected vigilantes targeted a victim.
As Matthew is a minor, no case was filed against him.
“The place outside is not safe for children like him,” his shelter parent said.
Sixteen-year-old Michael Jayson Diaz was not as lucky as Matthew.
On a Saturday morning last June, village security volunteer Lourdes Luna was alerted to a sack dumped near her home at Barangay Commonwealth in suburban Quezon City.
“I gave it a kick and blood oozed out of it,” said Luna, 58, who arrived at the scene with another volunteer. “I immediately thought it was a dead pig.”
The two decided to slash the sack open and were shocked to find the body of a boy inside.
Ironically, a blue baller on the boy’s ankle bore the name of Mr. Duterte, who campaigned on an anticrime platform.


The boy was hogtied and his slender body was bent all the way back so that his head almost touched his feet. His body bore multiple stab wounds.
Crime scene investigators arrived and asked the usual questions.
No one claimed the body.
While President Duterte was still weeks away from officially assuming power, the boy’s death was a clear indication he was intent on keeping his campaign pledge.
Nida Curitana, of the barangay council’s women and children desk, later recognized the body as that of Jayson, who was frequently caught for theft and for breaking the 10 p.m. curfew in the area.
Under the Child and Youth Welfare Code, the Barangay Council for the Protection of Children (BCPC) is tasked with caring for the children.
Jayson was an out-of-school youth from Batasan Hills, said Mercy Aloro, a spokesperson for BCPC-Commonwealth.
As he was not a resident of Commonwealth, the village had no jurisdiction over him and the council let him go whenever he was caught.
The social workers said Jayson was often seen with three other minors who worked as scavengers at night but were known also as runners for drug sellers in a nearby area.
Sadly, stories of poor children in the drug trade have become common. Pushers and traffickers use children because they know that under current laws, minors cannot be prosecuted.


Aloro said a recent case she handled involved an 11-year-old shabu user, who was used as a runner by local drug pushers.
The boy was arrested and detained for several days, like Matthew, but the court later ordered the police to free him.
“The court asked us, ‘What are you going to do with the child?’” Aloro said. “We had only one answer—you cannot send him back to his community. Why? First, it’s dangerous for the kid, he’s already at risk. He could get killed. Pull out the child, that was our recommendation. So his parents sent him to Bicol.”
According to studies, the high drug affectation rate in densely populated areas of Quezon City has contributed to the spread of illegal drugs. This is the same problem in poor communities in Manila, including the slums of Pasay and Tondo districts.
The Quezon City police listed 160 children among those who surrendered for drug offenses from June 2016 last year to Feb. 5.
Nationwide, the Philippine National Police recorded 26,415 children among those who surrendered for drug offenses from July 2016 to January 2017. More than 800,000 turned themselves in during that period.
The majority of those who surrendered were drug users; 131 were arrested for delivering and 299 for selling drugs.
Community leaders say the drug problem has become rampant, but perennial lack of funds and trained personnel are weighing down antidrug programs.
Current laws require local government units to set aside just one percent of their internal revenue allotment (IRA) for local councils for the protection of children. And community social workers need more training on “restorative justice,” according to the Humanitarian Legal Assistance Foundation.
While village social workers were already good in counseling, they have yet to learn other procedures, such as determining children’s level of addiction, the foundation said.


Barangay Commonwealth, for instance, is set to launch this year a pioneering drug rehabilitation program for children, with 100 kids as the first participants.
It was, however, too late for Jayson. The single-page spot report on his death has been shelved in a stockroom in the community hall.
No one has been prosecuted for his murder, a cold case that serves as a cautionary tale for parents and their children in highly vulnerable, impoverished communities.

REYES
In just under three hours, unidentified gunmen killed seven people in four shooting incidents in Quezon City, including two men and two women who were attacked inside their house from late Wednesday night to early Thursday morning.
The cases were recorded by the Quezon City Police District as “deaths under investigation” but raised questions whether they were the continuation of the bloody war on drugs that had so far claimed over 7,000 lives under the seven-month-old Duterte administration.

QCPD director, Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, QCPD director, acknowledged that seven killings in just one night were “unusual” but said there had been similar incidents of such scale in the past.
Eleazar said the homicide division of the QCPD was still investigating whether the deaths were drug-related. “Based on initial information, these are drug users but we still have to verify our information,” he told the Inquirer.FEATURED STORIES

A report to Eleazar said two men on separate motorbikes approached a village outpost in Barangay Commonwealth around 11 p.m. on Wednesday, where Jeffrey Villanueva, 28, and three other barangay public safety officers were on duty.
The gunmen, who both wore helmets and jackets, shot Villanueva several times as his fellow security officers fled in fear. 
SPO2 Terixon Galano of the QCPD-Batasan station said a .38-cal revolver with four live rounds were recovered from the victim’s bag.
An hour later, inside a house at Area 5, Barangay Old Balara, three persons were killed on the spot while a fourth victim died at East Avenue Medical Center.
The QCPD identified two of the victims as Donnie Rey Valenzuela, 28; and Julius Asuncion, 28. The other two fatalities recorded only as “Ate” and “Mirachua” at press time.
Supt. Lito Patay, station commander of QCPD-Batasan, said his men could not immediately confirm whether the victims were on the drug watch list, saying the station’s computer was “corrupted.”
“Until now we have not yet fixed our computer,” he said in a text message. “But our investigation is ongoing.”

In Novaliches, two gunmen in a white vehicle shot a man as he was walking along David Street in Barangay San Bartolome around 12:45 a.m. Thursday.
The victim remained unidentified and was described to be around 30 to 35 years old, of medium build, and had several tattoos on his shoulders, chest and back.
Around 2 a.m., also in Novaliches, a driver identified as Marvin Pio, 35, was found dead with bullet wounds in his neck and face along General Luis Street in Barangay Nagkaisang Nayon.
The Inquirer has yet to receive confirmation from the Novaliches police station commander whether Pio’s death was linked to illegal drugs.
Eleazar said the QCPD would double its efforts to  solve the killings as soon as possible.

TAGBILARAN CITY—What would have been a routine drive home for lawyer Mia Manuelita Mascariñas-Green on Wednesday afternoon ended in a brutal murder witnessed by her three young children in this city in Bohol province.
The four gunmen did not just leave after shooting Mascariñas-Green, 49, who was driving her Toyota Innova. They also taunted  her 10-year-old daughter and 2-year-old twins and the children’s nanny, pointing their guns at them before fleeing on board two motorcycles, police said.

“They even bullied the kids and the yaya,” said Supt. Nicomedes Olaivar, Tagbilaran City police chief. “They made faces and then laughed at them,” he added.

He admitted, though, that while the police had established the identities of the suspects, investigators had yet to determine the motive of the killing, which he described as “well-planned.”
Olaivar said police were not discounting the possibility that the attack was related to Mascariñas-Green’s job as a lawyer. 
“We all knew Attorney Mascariñas (Green), palaban unya (she fights) for the poor,” he said.
Mascariñas-Green was known as an environmental lawyer and was part of the Environmental Legal Assistance Center. She also handled civil and criminal cases.
Olaivar said the suspects were familiar with the lawyer’s daily routine.
Mascariñas-Green left her law office in Dampas District with her children and nanny at 4:27 p.m. on Wednesday.
“It was the usual route she was taking when going home (to Loon town) to escape traffic jams in  the city,” Olaivar said.

When her Toyota Innova reached the corner of H. Zamora and J.A. Clarin Streets in Dao District, two motorcycles blocked her path and fired at her.
Her children were unharmed as they were seated at the back passenger seat.
Mascariñas-Green had  three bullet wounds in the head and four bullet wounds in the body. She died at  Holy Name Hospital Medical Center here.
Investigators recovered at least 27 spent shells from .45 cal. and 9mm pistols from the crime scene, Olaivar said.
Mascariñas-Green’s husband, Stuart, a British, was in Bangkok for a conference and was expected to arrive in Bohol on Thursday. The family had yet to issue an official statement.
Mascariñas-Green  was a student leader  at  Divine Word College of Tagbilaran (DWCT), now Holy Name University.
“She had excellent leadership skills and was articulate. She fought for the rights of students,” said Rosalinda Paredes,  former director for student affairs at DWCT.

(INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE)
DAVAO CITY – In 2009, then Commission on Human Rights chair Leila de Lima led the probe on the Davao Death Squad, which was blamed for the killings of suspected drugs pushers and criminals here.
During the investigation, the CHR team dug up human bones from a “mass grave” inside the firing range, also known as the Laud quarry, in Barangay Ma-a here.

The commission first showed a lone skull from what the agency termed as “set of human bones.” The skull was found from a cave where a thigh bone was also found.
De Lima, in an email to the Philippine Daily Inquirer in 2009, enumerated the following as the ones they exhumed: forearm bone, bone fragment, another bone fragment of a skull from site 1; bone fragment of a skull, incomplete lone bone, part of an arm bone from site 2; forearm bone, a thigh bone, skull with parts missing (the one with a gunshot mark) from site 3; arm bone, three leg bones, a thigh bone, and a long bone fragment from site 4; 107 pieces of bones and bone fragments, six vertebral backbones, two collar bones, 19 rib fragments, two arm bones, one forearm bone (ulna), one forearm bone (radius), two thigh bones, and two pelvic bone fragments.FEATURED STORIES

In a statement released July 14, 2009, the CHR said that more human bones were recovered from the three sites after a witness, whom De Lima said was a former member of the DDS, pointed at the spot. The witness, De Lima said, told them that he buried the victim about five to six years ago.
But the commission has not presented a complete set of human skeletal remains, just fragments. There were also no clothes, personal belongings like shoes or wallets that are usually found in mass graves. 
A CHR press release dated July 7, 2009, stated that diggings were done based on the search warrant issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 34 of Manila. It added: “The site is believed to be the dumping ground of bodies of victims of summary killings, according to informants of the CHR.”
“Diggings immediately undertaken resulted in the findings of several fragments identified by the SOCO (Scene of the Crime Office) as human remains…with positive results so far achieved, the team is very optimistic that more remnants of summary executions are about to be unearthed,” the CHR statement said.
“The multi-agency task force, particularly the CHR and the PNP, assured the public that this no nonsense effort will continue without leaving any stone unturned to carry out its mandate within the legally established procedure allowed under existing laws,” the CHR added.
After the CHR probe, and even with the recovered bones, no charges have been filed against anyone.
De Lima was appointed justice secretary after 2010 by the new President then, Benigno Aquino III.  She is now a senator but has been detained for her alleged connection to the purported illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison.  SFM/rga

In her testimony during the homily, Maria Isabelita “Gretchen” Espinosa, a vegetable vendor, recalled the pain of having to welcome the new year with the death of her son Sonny, one of seven people shot by unidentified masked men in Bagong Silang, Caloocan last Dec. 28.
A weeping Espinosa recalled that Sonny would often skip classes to help her pick and sell vegetables, just so his brother would have “baon” (a daily allowance) in school. 
“Ang pinakamasakit: Hindi nila binigyan ng pagkakataon ang mga batang magkaroong ng sariling buhay na maayos,” Espinosa said. “At ang pinakamasakit nito: Bakit ang mga walang kasalanan, sila pa ang nadadamay? Dahil ba sa wala silang alam kaya hindi sila makatakbo para makatakas?”
(“What’s really painful is that they didn’t give the children a chance to have a proper life of their own. And what’s even more painful: Why are the innocent the ones who get caught up in the incidents? Is it because they know nothing so that they can’t run away and escape?”)
“Napakahirap isipin na, sa isang iglap lang, mawawala ang isa sa mga anak mo,” she went on. “Bagong taon ang kayakap ko ay isang kabaong na ang laman ay anak ko, dahil lang sa nadadamay. Masama po sa loob ko, pero wala akong magawa. Kaya nga po ngayon, ang hinihiling ko na lang kay Ama, kung sino man po ang may mga kagagawan nito ay siya na po ang bahalang magparusa.”
(“It’s so hard to accept that, in just an instant, your child would be gone. On New Year’s Day what I was embracing was a coffin with my son in it, just because he was caught up in the line of fire. I feel bad about it, but I could do nothing. That’s why all I’m asking for now from the Father is that he be the judge of whoever was responsible for this.”)
She found some comfort from the Church and people who had been helping her. But she said the pain of her loss still weighed heavily.

“Masaya dahil may tumutulong at mabigyan ng kalinawan. Malungkot dahil hindi ko na makakasama ang anak ko. Ang tanging maiiwan na lamang ay alaala at itong picture niya. Malungkot dahil kailan ay hindi ko na siya mayakap,” she said.
(“I’m happy because there are those who are helping and trying to clear up things. I’m said because I can no longer be with my son. All I have left is his memory and his picture. I’m sad because I can never ever embrace him again.”)
“Sino ngayon ang kasama ko? Maisasama ko pa ba to? Hindi na, nang dahil lang sa mga walang puso at iniisip lang ang mga sarili nila. Hindi nila inisip na may buhay at pangarap ang mga pinaslang nila, kundi mga pansarili lang nila,” she said. “Hindi ko alam kung pangkaligtasan ba nila ang mga ginawa nila o para matakpan ang mga kasalanan nila.”
(“Who’s going to be with me now? Can I still be with him? No more, just because of these heartless people who were only thinking of themselves. They didn’t think that the people they killed had lives and dreams of their own. They only thought about themselves. I don’t know if what they did was to ensure their own safety or to cover up for their wrongdoings.”)

Fr. Joselito Bong Sarabia, HEMA founder, called on the government, church leaders, and ordinary citizens to pause, reexamine their conscience, and empathize with the sufferings of the victims of extrajudicial killigns.
Illegal drugs, he said, were being used to justify the spate of summary killings in the country.
“I hope this Lenten season we will be able to pause really and examine why are these things happening,” Sarabia told the Inquirer. “Why do they do this to the poor? And why do we permit this as sambayanang Pilipino (a Filipino nation) – not only as a church but a fellow human being?”
Aside from spiritual help, Sarabia said HEMA, with the help of its partner organizations, have been sheltering EJK victims and witnesses who fear for their lives in their own neighborhoods.
“We have certain witnesses already that we are sheltering in other areas with certain partners and religious orders,” he said. “Pope Francis himself said: Open the doors of the church for refugees. The same also for our beleaguered faithful now. Blood and flesh sanitized. The only option really is to transfer to another place.”
“We need support,” he added. “That’s why some parishes have engaged in livelihood and income-generating programs to sustain their needs.”


There had been no second collection for the victims, he said. But he was thanful that some churches, like Baclaran Church, spend for the burial of the victims.
More than 7,000 Filipinos have been killed in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, which has been denounced by international rights groups as plagued with abuses.
Duterte himself suspended the antinarcotics campaign in January at the height of controversy surrounding the murder of a South Korean businessman Jee Ick Joo inside Camp Crame, the headquarters of the Philippine National Police (PNP). But barely a month after its suspension, the government is mulling a return of the drug war – supposedly because “the situation is getting worse.”
In its latest report, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said Duterte could be held criminally liable for the spate of “systematic” killings in the country. HRW claimed the police were involved in the killings and awere re planting evidence at crime scenes.
Espinosa, speaking for his son and other families who had lost their loved ones, called on Duterte to rethink his war on drugs, which she said was only targeting poor families and communities.
She had this message for Duterte: “Nawa po naman na ang isipin muna niya na ang mga nadadamay ngayon sa mga pinalulunsad ay mga walang kamalay-malay, mga walang kinalaman, at mga mahihirap lamang na katulad ko na nagsusunog ng talbos at kangkong para mabuhay lang ang pamilya. Sana naman po ay maisip na kaming mga mahihirap ay wala kaming kalaban-laban.”
{“I hope he considers first that those who get caught up in these incidents are unaware, had nothing to do with drugs, and are just poor people like me that would eat vegetable sprouts and river spinach to keep the family alive. I hope he will consider that we, the poor people, are completely defenseless“).
Edwin, a father of a victim from Caloocan, also had this plea to the President: “Sana itigil na, wakasan na, tapusin na ang ganitong klaseng pamamaslang sapagkat marami ang nadadamay na inosente.”
(“I hope he will put an end to this kind of killings because so many innocent people have been affected.“) /atm

“Look at what they did to my child. How could they kill him while he was sleeping?” said Teresita Lumawag, showing a photo of her 26-year-old son Ronaldo as he lay bleeding.

The younger Lumawag was one of the thousands who had surrendered to the police to be documented as a drug user under “Oplan Tokhang” campaign. Teresita said he was about to be admitted to a rehabilitation facility when he was killed by unidentified gunmen in their house in Camarin, Caloocan City on Nov. 28 last year.
Sought out and counseled by the clergy, Teresita and about 70 others with similar tales of loss gathered for a 3 p.m. Mass on Thursday at Baclaran Church or the National Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Parañaque City.FEATURED STORIES

“Heaven is weeping with us,” one of them said, carrying a picture of a slain family member.
Celebrated by Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez and several priests from different parishes in Metro Manila, the Mass was the second to be organized by the Holy Eucharist Mass Action (Hema) for the EJK victims.

First Mass
Hema, a group mainly composed of Catholic priests, held the first Mass on Feb. 2 at Our Lady of Victory Chapel in Malabon City. The service gathered more than 250 grieving families.
Dennis Febre, an apostolate program coordinator at Baclaran Church, noted that over the last month, “the number of families we are assisting has more than doubled. From the initial 30, we now have 70 families.”
“People are starting to voice out that they have been victims of violence, after we educated them about their rights,” Febre told the Inquirer.
But Hema founder, Fr. Joselito  Sarabia, noted that compared to the first Mass in Malabon, the Baclaran service saw fewer families in attendance.

“We know they are still scared since they were still being threatened by the police and other people. It took a lot of courage for them to come here,” said Sarabia, who is also the director of St. Vincent Seminary in Quezon City.
Like Lumawag, more mothers, siblings and orphaned children shared their stories during the Mass, unable to hold back tears.
Gretchen Espinosa of Bagong Silang, Caloocan, raged against the killers of her 16-year-old son, Sonny, who was shot dead also on Nov. 28 along with six other people who were listed posthumously by the police as drug suspects.
“Imagine my sadness when New Year came and I was embracing the cold casket of my son!” she said, recounting the wake that lasted for more than a month.
In a message to the killers, Espinosa said: “If you have escaped the law of men, I am sure that you will not escape God’s punishment. It’s one of His commandments: You should not kill.”

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/877348/tokhang-survivor-sues-cops,‘Tokhang’ survivor sues cops,"12:36 AM March 04, 2017","A 29-year-old fruit vendor who survived a bloody drug raid in Quezon City’s Payatas district last year has filed a criminal complaint against four policemen and their informants, in yet another legal challenge against the government’s antinarcotics campaign, his lawyers said on Friday.
Efren Morillo filed a complaint for murder, frustrated murder, robbery and planting of drugs and firearms in the Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday. The suit comes a month after an appeals court ruled on a petition filed by Morillo and the families of the four other victims to issue a protection order keeping the police away from them.

The court also ordered the police involved be transferred to another station and to disclose any evidence against the suspects that led to the drug raid.
Morillo is the first known survivor of the police’s “Oplan Tokhang” to win a court protection under the writ of amparo.FEATURED STORIES

Morillo’s complaint also comes in the wake of the government’s pronouncements that Oplan Tokhang, which has been criticized for violating the right to due process, will soon be revived after it was halted in January. Tokhang is a combination of two Filipino words to mean “knock and plead,” in which police officers would call on homes of suspected drug users to persuade them to surrender.
Named as respondents in Morillo’s complaint were Police Senior Insp. Emil Garcia, Police Officer 3 Allan Formilleza, PO1 James Aggarao and PO1 Melchor Navisaga, who were formerly detailed with the Quezon City Police District Station 6. Also sued were their purported informants Lea Barcelona, Mary Joy Ralo, Lorie Barcelona and Richard Andan alias “Manok.” 
“If I may call on our beloved President, do not continue Oplan Tokhang. The police only use it and abuse it,” Morillo said.
Morillo was visiting a friend’s place in Payatas in August last year when the police raid occurred. He said the policemen shot four of his companions “execution style.” He survived by playing dead, and later escaped despite his injury.
Autopsies indicated that the victims were shot at close range. The informant also allegedly stole jewelry and other items from the ramshackle house of Morillo’s friend, Marcelo “Nonoy” Daa Jr., who was one of those killed.
Lawyer Cristina Antonio of the Center for International Law, a human rights group assisting Morillo in the case, said the relatives of the other victims “would also file criminal and administrative cases against the QC police officers involved and their agents in the weeks to come.”
More charges

“The filing was but a natural step, amparo being also a curative remedy that lays the foundation for criminal and administrative charges,” Antonio said, adding that the relatives were preparing to file charges.
Morillo claimed that he and his friends were playing pool when armed men carried out a raid and shot them when they refused to admit to owning the silver foil and toy gun found at the scene.
“From what I have narrated, it is clear that we were not using “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) but merely playing pool, but we were arrested and forced to admit that we own the plastic sachet with white substance inside that they were holding,” he said in his sworn statement.
Morillo named Formilleza as the policeman who shot him and his friend when they protested their innocence. He said he was hit in the chest but did not lose consciousness right away.
“I saw him fire two shots at Nonoy, who fell to the ground beside me and started running out of breath,” he continued. “Then he fired another shot at Nonoy. Thoroughly frightened that I might be shot again, I closed my eyes and played dead.”
Morillo said he recognized Formilleza but only found out his name later on, when the police filed a complaint against him in the city prosecutor’s office for direct assault against an agent of a person in authority by resisting arrest during the tokhang operation.
The policemen had even claimed in media interviews that Morillo and his companions were caught smoking meth, and even dubbed them notorious drug suspects and robbers.
“Nevertheless, the policemen themselves admit to shooting me and my companions. They are claiming that the shooting was in fulfillment of their duties in relation to an antidrug operation,” he said. “They claim that we resisted and fought back. However, these allegations are baseless and are mere fabrications.”

Less than five hours later, Christina Padual and a man identified only as Alvin were also gunned down by unidentified suspects who fled on three motorcycles.
The victims were shot dead in front of a beerhouse on Commonwealth Avenue. The police recovered two rolled-up aluminum foils with suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride or “shabu” from the woman. 
Around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, two men in black jackets and wearing face masks reportedly entered a house at St. Peter Street in Barangay Holy Spirit.
Police reports said the suspects shot dead the sleeping Lorna Adalid, 56, and Mark Astrologo, 22. A woman, who was with her two sons in an adjacent room, told the police that the suspects looked for Adalid’s son, Francis, but he had already escaped by destroying the roof of the house.
The gunmen then fled in  a white van.
With the rising number of the so-called deaths under investigation in the city, Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, QCPD director, said his team would enhance efforts to lessen the killings.
“It is the responsibility of every police station to prevent the deaths by placing several checkpoints and encouraging curfews in their area,” Eleazar said, noting that Oplan Sita would be strengthened, as most killers use motorbikes as their getaway vehicles.

“We will also work harder to investigate the cases that have already happened,” he said.
With the anticipated revival of the government’s campaign against drugs, Eleazar said the QCPD would reactivate its antidrug units to lead the operations.
The District Drug Enforcement Unit will now be directly under QCPD’s intelligence division. Station Drug Enforcement Teams will be under the supervision of the intelligence division of each police station.
Eleazar said the QCPD would employ the same operatives under the disbanded District Anti-Illegal Drug (DAID) units and their station-level counterparts.
He said these officers were already vetted, as he had removed all previous antidrug operatives in QCPD when he took office in July.
“But we will still continue evaluating them,” he said, noting that the QCPD had been doing its “internal cleansing” alongside the drug war.
The ranking officer said Oplan Tokhang was dropped due to its “tainted” image.
“This time, the police will work directly on drug enforcement. There will be no more pleas for surrender,” Eleazar said. “Only the local government will continue efforts to encourage surrenderers and rehabilitation.”

He said his fellow legal counsels reported that “just the other day, two dead bodies were disposed (of)” near Daa’s house–something he said was “like a veiled threat against our clients.” 
Still, Bagares said the families of the slain suspects have not lost their resolve. “They are here to seek justice for their loved ones,” he told Ombudsman reporters.

In a previous Philippine Daily Inquirer article, Lascañas said he left the country because he had been receiving threats that a lawsuit would be filed against him, and people were looking for him as well.
Lascañas said the moment he received these pieces of information, he
realized it was better to leave the country “for the time being.” 
In February, Lascañas made a stunning turnaround from his statements last year at a Senate investigation where he denied involvement in the DDS, as well as allegations made by another self-confessed DDS member, Edgar Matobato.
Lascañas admitted to lying when he first appeared at the Senate, saying he did so out of fear for his family’s safety.
In his press conference on Feb. 20, Lascañas accused President Duterte of organizing the DDS to kill petty criminals and his enemies in Davao City. Lascañas was then assisted by his lawyers from the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) led by its national chairman Jose Manuel Diokno, and supported by opposition Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV.
From then on, Lascañas has been provided safe haven by a number of supporters, some of whom helped him in his flight out of the country.
Malacañang had denied the allegations Lascañas made, saying these were part of the plan to “destroy the President and topple his administration.”  SFM

Beleaguered NBI Director Dante Gierran on Thursday let the ax fall on Ricardo Diaz, the bureau’s head in Metro Manila, after he was implicated in the kidnap-slaying of Korean executive Jee Ick-joo.

Three other senior officials of the NBI, the primary law enforcement unit of the Department of Justice, were also sacked by Gierran in the wake of President Rodrigo Duterte’s outrage over Jee’s killing.

He said the drug problem was now regarded as a “national security threat,” which would allow him to deploy soldiers in antidrug operations.
No trust in NBI 
“The bureau is suspended from enforcing drug laws. You’re included. I have lost trust in you,” the President said.
He said only the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, headed by his longtime security aide Isidro Lapeña, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines were authorized to carry out drug raids.
“I still have to (issue) a proclamation (or) executive order, but I have taken in the AFP and raise the issue of drugs as a national security threat,” he said. “They can call all the Armed Forces to assist… in the meantime that there will be a cleansing, a purge inside Camp Crame and the NBI,” he continued.
Diaz, a longtime NBI agent, has been accused by Supt. Rafael Dumlao III, one of the primary suspects in Jee’s  murder, of having a hand in the incident, which reflected the susceptibility of the President’s merciless drug war to abuses.
Also sacked were Roel Bolivar, the erstwhile head of the NBI Task Force Against Illegal Drugs, who was replaced by his deputy, Jonathan Galicia; NBI-Metro Manila head agent Darwin Lising; and the NBI deputy director for investigative services, Jose Yap.

The NBI deputy director for intelligence, Vicente de Guzman III, took over Yap’s position, while lawyer Sixto Burgos replaced De Guzman.
Joint investigation
According to Gierran, he and PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa met on Wednesday with Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who had presided over the Senate inquiry into Jee’s murder and other similar cases of “tokhang for ransom.”
He said the PNP and the NBI agreed to create a joint investigation team and cooperate closely in resolving Jee’s case.
Gierran said Medardo Delemos has been tasked to head the NBI team while Senior Supt. Glenn Dumlao, chief of the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG), was assigned to lead the police investigators.
Glenn Dumlao was previously indicted in the celebrated kidnapping and murder of publicist Salvador “Bubby” Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito.
Lacson, then the superior of Glenn Dumlao in the now-defunct Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, was also charged in the Dacer-Corbito double murder case.

A piece of paper placed next to the victim’s body had a handwritten message in Filipino that read: “I am a drug pusher. Don’t be like me or you will end up dead, too. My fellow pushers, leave this place if you still value your lives!”
But according to Barangay chair Felicito Valmocina, Sanchez was not involved in illegal drugs and that fellow local officials can vouch for his being “clean.” 
“Perhaps his only involvement is when he relayed information to me about suspected drug users, when he was the head of our barangay public safety office three years ago,” said Valmocina, who had worked with the victim for more than two decades.
Valmocina surmised that the killers may have left the “pusher” sign to mislead the investigation.
Aside from being deputy administrator, Sanchez also headed the barangay’s urban settlers affairs department and usually served as mediator between private lot owners and informal settlers, the village chair added.
Calling Sanchez his “strong asset,” Valmocina said his work in the department resulted in more than 30 private lots being cleared of squatters.
He also recalled that Sanchez tested negative when random drug tests were conducted in their barangay.

It was one of those conversations with her husband that Mylene Son would never forget.
On the night of Sept. 15 this year, Police Chief Insp. Jesus “Jim” Son told his wife: “Baka hanggang ngayon o bukas na lang ang buhay ko  (My life might end today or tomorrow).”

Her husband was no stranger to death threats, Mylene said. Known as a tough police officer in Leyte, Son was not the type who would be shaken by any threat. But that night, Mylene said, he talked about being killed like he was so sure it would happen and that he knew who would do it.
“He told me who threatened him and that he also told his closest friend about it,” Mylene recounted.FEATURED STORIES

On Monday, Dec. 5, Mylene will face the Senate inquiry on invitation by the committee headed by Sen. Panfilo Lacson. “Sasabihin ko ang lahat ng katotohanang nalalaman ko  (I will tell all that I know),” she said.
Son told Mylene about a direct threat from Supt. Marvin Marcos, Region 8’s chief of Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG). 
“Mainit daw sa kanya si Supt. Marcos kasi hindi niya ginawa ang inuutos sa kanya na  ‘project.’ Gusto daw tignan kung hanggang saan talaga ang tapang ng asawa ko  (He said Marcos was mad because he did not do the project assigned to him.  My husband said Marcos wanted to see how far he’d go in defying him),” Mylene said.
Son and Marcos were not on speaking terms because in a previous local election, Marcos’ wife, Marites, had run against Edgar Empillo Sr., Son’s father-in-law, for the vice mayoral post in Pastrana town, Leyte. Son’s father-in-law won, while Marcos’ wife placed third in the race.
Making amends
Then sometime in August, Marcos started talking to Son again, Mylene said, adding that her husband thought it was because the CIDG head wanted to make amends for his previous hostility.
Son did not realize that Marcos was trying to lure him into doing a very sensitive “project,” Mylene said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


The “project” targeted someone who had identified key personalities involved in the proliferation of illegal drugs in Eastern Visayas, as well as government and police officials who had received protection money for the illegal drugs trade of Kerwin Espinosa.
Mylene said her husband told her the “project” was a hit on Albuera, Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa. “Marcos asked my husband if he has an asset who could kill Espinosa for a P500,000 fee. Son said he’d look for one; he felt pressured to do it. Then a close relative and friend advised my husband not to do it because Mayor Espinosa was under the witness protection program. He just might become a fall guy,” Mylene recalled her husband telling her.
On the night of Sept. 15, Son on his joint Facebook account with his wife, posted this message, “Pulis sa pulis … putangina mo!!! offer ka nga, naka witness protection program naman …. tapos double cross mo kami … ala ka bayag … subukin mo ako hamunin nang harapan … I’m sure may mamamatay sa atin!!! Wag mo ako traidurin!!! Di kita uurungan! (Cop versus cop … son of a whore!  You made an offer on [a guy under] the witness protection program then you dare double cross us. You have no balls. Why don’t you fight me face to face? I’m sure one of us will die. Don’t double cross me! I will not back down).”
Ambushed
The message was addressed to Marcos, according to Mylene. At that time, Mayor Espinosa was still in the custody of Albuera Police Chief Inspector Jovie Espenido.
The following day, Son was ambushed by unidentified assailants along the national highway of Barangay Piilit, Sta. Fe in Leyte province. Initial investigation reports said the ambush was work-related because Son was a former intelligence officer of Leyte’s Anti-Drugs Group and had received recognition and commendations for several antidrug operations.
“That morning, he was so happy.  He woke me and said, it’s Friday, I’ll be attending the flag-raising ceremony,” Mylene recalled. Her husband also promised to go home after the flag-raising ceremony to help a neighbor who had been robbed.
“He left past 6 and I texted him saying I’ll wait for him at the Snack Haus so we could go home together,” Mylene said. But until 9 that morning, there was no response to her message. At past 9, Son texted back. “Pauwi na ako (on my way home)” and she had responded, “OK. Love u.” It was the last communication between husband and wife.
By 10, Mylene got suspicious when some friends checked on her. Was she at the Snack Haus? Was she with her husband? they wanted to know. “My friends knew that no matter how difficult it was for me, I would always go with my husband wherever he might be assigned.  I want someone to converse with,” Mylene said, not knowing that her friends already knew about her husband’s ambush when they called her.
On Nov. 5, Mayor Espinosa was killed by a CIDG team led by Marcos inside a subprovincial jail in Leyte.


Powerful backers?
Weeks after that, Mylene sought the Inquirer for help, fearing that Marcos would go after her and her children next.  She wanted to talk as early as three weeks ago but became hesitant when she saw Marcos’ demeanor during the Senate inquiry led by Lacson.
“Ang lakas ng loob niya, parang may ipinagmamalaki. Paano ka magsasalita laban sa taong ganun kalakas ang loob na parang nakasandal sa pader?  (He sounded so sure, so confident like he has powerful backers. How can you talk against someone who has such strong connections?)”
Recently, Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa revealed that someone higher than him had asked that Marcos be reinstated as CIDG Region 8 Director.
Soon after, as speculation grew about Dela Rosa’s compadre who had interceded for Marcos, President Duterte himself admitted that it was him, through Secretary Bong Go, who had ordered Marcos’ reinstatement.
He needed the CIDG head back in his post, the President said, because he was still conducting an investigation on Marcos and was trying to piece together his  connections in the illegal drugs trade.

But Ancyl Tulalian said she would now rather cover her ears than hear the loud explosions, which served to remind her of the shots that felled her husband on Wednesday night.

Tricycle driver Jerry Tulalian, 37, was driving on Roxas Boulevard at 10:15 p.m. near the police traffic enforcement unit and Cuneta Astrodome when two black-shirted men on a motorcycle appeared.

Crime scene investigators recovered one fired cartridge from a .45-cal. pistol and a heat-sealed sachet of suspected “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride). A placard was also found inside Tulalian’s green tricycle, calling him a “drug pusher” who should not be anyone’s role model.
Ancyl claimed Tulalian never peddled drugs, but said there was talk “in the neighborhood that he uses [shabu] but I do not believe them.” 
“I always check him every time he sleeps, and I only find a pack of cigarettes, nothing more,” she said.
Waiting for Calixto
Tulalian’s wife expressed disappointment at Mayor Antonino Calixto’s silence on the string of drug-related deaths in the city. “I know he will talk during the Pasay Day celebration, but he doesn’t say anything about the killings that happen left and right here in Pasay, unlike other mayors I saw on TV who ordered their police to do something.”
Reached for comment, Calixto said his office had been receiving reports of deaths under inquiry, a police euphemism for extrajudicial killings. But he said his hands were tied because there were no formal complaints filed.
“There are only two complaints filed in the police. The other families are not filing cases with proper authorities,” the mayor said.

He was referring to Hara Kazuo, the widow of Jaypee Bertes, who was killed by policemen along with his father inside a Pasay police precinct in July,  and Rachel Bermoy, whose live-in partner, Eric Sison, was shot dead by Pasay police in Barangay 43.
Calixto said he already ordered police to solve the cases as soon as possible, and frankly asked them if they were involved in the deaths.
“They denied this, saying others fought with operatives and most were killed by motorcycle-riding suspects,” he said. “Many were killed but Pasay has been more peaceful compared with the previous years,” the mayor claimed, saying there were fewer people loitering in the streets at night.
The mayor brought flowers at Tulalian’s wake at Veronica Memorial Homes, but Sammy, the victim’s younger  brother, said what they needed was justice.
Brother’s story
Tulalian’s fellow tricycle drivers at Gumban said someone may have planned his death. According to Sammy, two women were seen waiting at the tricycle terminal past 9 p.m. on Wednesday.
The two, however, refused to ride other tricycles other than Tulalian’s. They asked to be dropped off at Cuneta Astrodome.
Ancyl, however, said she could not think of anyone who could plot her husband’s death. “He used to be a barangay tanod and people here even urged him to run as barangay councilor. He had no crime record,” the wife added. “He was a good man.”
Ancyl, who is eight months pregnant, said her husband was also a good father to their two children aged 11 and one./rga

According to Donna, Halcon was a single man who enjoyed the company of his three friends and his dog Blackie.
The dog, also one of the witnesses to the killings, has not moved since from the bottom of the stairs leading to the second floor where his owner was killed. 
“Maybe he is waiting for Uncle Bernie to come home. We don’t know how to tell him he’s gone,” Donna said.
According to Halcon’s neighbors who refused to be identified for fear of their lives, six men on three motorcycles went inside their compound, two of them remaining at the entrance to serve as lookouts.
At that time, Halcon was watching television with his 18-year-old niece and her friend, in addition to his friends: Roland Santos of Barangay Rosario, alias Onay of Barangay Caniogan and alias Jayson of Cubao, Quezon City.
All of them were herded upstairs to the second floor of the house where Halcon’s niece and friend were ordered to go inside one of the rooms. They were not harmed.
Halcon and his friends, however, were shot dead. Crime scene operatives later recovered 29 slugs and casings from an unknown firearm, as well as a sachet of what was believed to be “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).
ADVERTISEMENT
 


A police investigation showed that Halcon was a drug pusher whose name was on the barangay’s drug watchlist.
Barangay officials, however, said that Halcon had earlier surrendered under “Oplan Tokhang” as a drug user, not as a pusher. But one official said he did not know that the victim was involved in illegal drugs, adding that he thought Halcon was a professional “tambay” (bum).
Santos, on the hand, was a “self-confessed” drug user and pusher who had also surrendered to authorities.
The police report, meanwhile, mistakenly identified Jayson as a resident of Maybunga and a drug pusher in the barangay. Local officials, however, said that he was there to have his business permit processed because he wanted to store vegetables in Halcon’s house.
Donna said she was hurt when people, especially the police, were quick to brand her uncle a drug pusher.
“He used to be a pusher but he cleaned up his act. Why was he not given a chance to change for the better?” Donna asked. She lamented that the police used the same “script” when her other uncle was killed.
“We already know that we cannot get justice because no one identified the killers. We just want my uncle’s name to be cleared,” she told the Inquirer.

CONTRIBUTED PHOTO
CALAPAN CITY—Anticrime crusader Zenaida Luz not only defended the poor and the weak in her community, but first and foremost, also protected her family.
When they were young, Luz’s parents often fought and ended up hurting each other. Being the eldest in a brood of 13, Luz grew up sheltering her siblings from her family’s woes.

“To protect us against the fighting at home, Ate would take us all to the farm and make us hide behind coconut trees,” recalled Perlita Alvarez, 48, Luz’s sister. “She would always tell us: don’t worry, I’ll find us a way out of poverty.”
Their parents, both fishermen in Oriental Mindoro province, could not afford to send the children to school, but Luz, who dreamt of becoming a lawyer, was persistent.FEATURED STORIES

In high school, she worked as a store helper and made sure “she came home even late at night or else we would not have anything to eat,” Alvarez said.
Luz then moved to Marinduque province and worked as a house helper for relatives, who supported her through college. 
“She was the smart one. She did not become a lawyer but she knew a lot from reading books about the law,” Alvarez said.
Instead, Luz became a teacher and taught high school for a while in Marinduque. She moved back to Oriental Mindoro, where she joined the Citizens Crime Watch (CCW), an anticrime civic organization, and headed its Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan (Mimaropa) chapter.
Luz, 51, was gunned down on Oct. 9 in front of her rented apartment that also served as CCW’s office in Barangay Maligaya in Gloria town, Oriental Mindoro. Her attackers were two pairs of motorcycle-riding gunmen, according to witnesses.
As the attack happened, policemen in Gloria were on their way to respond to a road accident nearby.
Alerted by the shooting incident, they instead ran after the fleeing gunmen. The first pair managed to escape but the second was cornered in Barangay Quinabigan in the next town of Pinamalayan.

A shootout ensued and just as the police approached the wounded gunmen, one of them screamed, “Tropa! Tropa (Troops)!”
Extrajudicial killing
They turned out to be Senior Insp. Magdaleno Pimentel Jr., then with the police’s Provincial Public Safety Company, and Insp. Markson Almeranez, then police chief of Socorro town. Police reports said Pimentel wore a ski mask, while Almeranez wore a woman’s wig.
CCW founder and lawyer Jose Malvar Villegas Jr. said the case of Luz was the “first concrete incident of extrajudicial killing” under President Duterte’s watch.
That the gunmen turned out to be ranking police officers also caught the attention of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
Luz, a widow, left three adult children, the youngest of whom is 20 years old.
Alvarez said her sister would side with her, no matter what. “I lost my own defender,” she said.
Soft inside
“[Luz] was very vocal, especially when she believed she was right about something. I think she must have learned to become strong early in life,” Alvarez said.
But to Luz’s live-in-partner of five years and fellow CCW member, Richard Albert, Luz “was strong outside but very soft inside.”


On the night of the murder, Albert said Luz had been receiving text messages from someone claiming to be a drug pusher. The person said he needed CCW’s help to protect his wife and child.
Despite Albert’s warning not to trust the person, Luz stepped out of their house to meet him.
Death, instead, waited for her.
Insp. Ruel Lito Fronda, Gloria police chief, confirmed the exchange of messages from Luz’s phone, which was recovered from the scene. He agreed the text messages were only a ploy.
“Like you, we also meddled into other people’s business,” Albert told the Inquirer.
He said Luz helped build up several cases against local government officials and her recent work involved paralegal services to victims of land disputes, drug abuse, rape and even members of indigenous communities.
She was also putting together a livelihood project for former drug users in Socorro, a reason she had met Almeranez sometime in August.
Albert said they did not personally know Almeranez or Pimentel.
Blow to PNP
The involvement of the two police officials was a blow to the Philippine National Police.


Pimentel and Almeranez were both graduates of the Philippine National Police Academy.
In September, Almeranez was awarded as outstanding police officer by PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa in a ceremony held here.
“[They were] among the best operators [in Mimaropa],” said Senior Supt. Christopher Birung, Oriental Mindoro police chief, citing successful police operations led by the two officers.
But records from the police Regional Internal Affairs Office showed that Pimentel was charged with “grave misconduct and serious irregularity in the performance of duty” in relation to a 2015 antidrug operation here. There were allegations of “excessive force” during a drug bust that left two suspects and one policeman dead.
A police source, who requested anonymity, believed Luz was a “contract kill” and Pimentel took the job “because he needed the money to settle the [2015] case.”
And whoever ordered the hit may have been someone that Almeranez could not refuse, the source said.
Ready to die
Alvarez said Luz seemed to be ready to face death anytime.
“Ate always said: If it is your time, it’s your time,” she said.
In 2013, gunmen fired at Luz’s previous house in Bansud town. This happened again last year in Luz’s house in Gloria.


Alvarez said they did not know if the attacks were related.
The family, represented by Juan Tria of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, and Villegas of the CCW, filed a case of murder against Pimentel and Almeranez at the Regional Trial Court Branch 42 in Pinamalayan on Oct. 28.
A separate case of direct assault and frustrated homicide was filed at the Municipal Trial Court by Gloria policemen wounded in the shoot out.
Pimentel and Almeranez stayed under hospital arrest in the Medical Mission Group Hospital here for two months. It was only on Wednesday night when they were sent, under heavy security, to the Gloria police station where they were detained. On Thursday, they were transferred to detention facilities in the towns of Pinamalayan and Bansud, respectively.
Fronda said it took them awhile because Pimentel and Almeranez could not settle their hospital bills immediately and the court had not issued a warrant or a commitment order until Thursday.
“We may be up against big people here but we trust the police,” Alvarez said.
Fronda believed they have a strong case against Pimentel and Almeranez, and were also close to filing charges against the two other gunmen who had escaped./rga

ILOILO CITY—At least 11,100 protesters on Panay, Negros and Cebu Islands joined activities commemorating Human Rights Day on Saturday, decrying the burial of the late President Ferdinand Marcos at the heroes’ cemetery and the continued extrajudicial killings (EJKs) of suspected drug personalities.
At least 5,000 marched on the streets of Capiz, 3,000 in Iloilo, 1,500 in Bacolod, 1,500 Aklan, and 100 in Cebu.

Protesters led by the Bagong Alyasang Makabayan and Capiz Environmental Protection Alliance converged at the Roxas City bandstand where a program was held. In the morning, a 40-vehicle protest caravan against mining activities passed around towns in the province.
About 1,000 protesters in Estancia town, Iloilo marched along the main streets and later burned a mock figure of Marcos. The protesters, many of whom were survivors of the Nov. 8, 2013, Supertyphoon “Yolanda,” also demanded the release of assistance for those affected by a massive oil spill during the supertyphoon.FEATURED STORIES

In Iloilo City, about 2,000 protesters attended Mass and a program organized by the Marcos No Hero Movement-Panay and the human rights group Karapatan at the Freedom Grandstand.
The activity was joined by martial law survivors, students, religious groups and professionals. 
They later marched to the grounds of the provincial capitol where the activity ended.
In Bacolod City, about 1,500 protesters joined a Human Rights Day rally at the Bacolod public plaza, calling for peace and justice for the victims of the Marcos dictatorship.
The Concerned Citizens of Negros (CCN) also held a torch parade and rally organized by the groups Block Marcos and IDefend in the evening.
Lawyer Andrea Si of CCN said the burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani was not just the burial of his remains but an attempt to bury the truth about the gruesome atrocities during his regime.
“The Marcos’ administration imprisoned 70,000 of his critics, killed 3,000 Filipinos and tortured 35,000 others, all to perpetuate his hold on power,” a CCN statement said.

“The attempt to blur the evils of martial law occurs at a time of rampant extrajudicial killings, threats to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, exclusion from the Cabinet of known oppositionists, sinister Congressional initiative to amend the 1987 People Power Constitution, and subservience of the Supreme Court and the legislature, coequal branches that are supposed to check and balance the power of the president,” according to the statement.
In the capital town of Kalibo in Aklan, about 1,500 protesters assembled at the Kalibo-Numancia bridge before marching to the Pastrana Park where a program was held.
Among those that joined the protest of Rise Up Aklan and Bayan was the group Dekada 80, composed of those who were part of the resistance against the Marcos dictatorship.
“Marcos’ burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani is a grave crime against the historical and victorious struggle of the people against martial law,” said Franklin Quimpo of Dekada 80.
In Cebu, two protesters wearing masks of Marcos and his wife Imelda led about 100 militants in marching to Fuente Osmeña rotunda on Saturday afternoon.
“Imelda” was carrying a baby who wore a face mask of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Teody Navea, secretary general of Sanlakas Cebu, said Duterte was shaping out to be like a dictator.
“We would like to challenge Duterte to eliminate drugs in the country but there should be no human rights being violated,” Navea said.

In Pasig City, separate attacks carried out from late Friday till the wee hours of Saturday killed three residents and critically wounded another, with the police saying that all the victims were on their watch list as drug peddlers and users.

Two hours earlier, 45-year-old manicurist Evelyn Coloma was shot and critically wounded in Purok 2 in Barangay Pineda.
Coloma’s daughter was in the toilet when gunshots were heard. She rushed outside and saw her bloodied mother slumped on the ground and the gunmen fleeing on a motorbike. 
Coloma remained under observation at the hospital as of Saturday. Like in Pangcoga’s case, the Pasig police said Coloma was also on the local list of users and pushers.
Around 11:30 p.m. Friday, 26-year-old Gerard John Amandi, was shot dead along Esguerra Street, Barangay Pinagbuhatan, also in Pasig.
Around 9:40 p.m., 32-year-old Jhonace Ryan Dotaro was shot dead on Villa Tupaz Street in Barangay San Joaquin while eating dinner with his partner. Four assailants barged into the house and shot him in the head and body, before escaping.
Hot spots
Barangays Pinagbuhatan, Sagad, Pineda and San Joaquin are considered hot spots of illegal drug activity in Pasig, where 112 cases of vigilante-style killings—which the police euphemistically call “deaths under investigation”—have been recorded since July.

Elsewhere in the metropolis, the families of three more men tagged by the police as drug suspects would be spending Christmas in mourning.
Medel Maglonat, 40, a notorious drug pusher in Parañaque City’s Marcelo Green barangay was gunned down around 8:45 a.m. on Friday by men on a motorbike.
In Pateros, two residents included on the watch list were also killed on Friday. The victims were identified as John Lester Certeza, 41, of P. Rosales Street,  Barangay Sta. Ana; and a man known only as “Baton,” who was shot on M. Almeda Street, Barangay Sto. Rosario-Silangan.
Pateros police chief, Supt. Joel Villanueva, noted that the three attacks had something in common: They involved four motorcycle-riding hit men wearing helmets and bonnets.
As hundreds marched to mark Human Rights Day on Saturday, President Duterte’s office said it wanted the police to investigate the thousands of deaths blamed on vigilantes.
More than 5,000 people have been killed in the antidrug campaign, either by unknown vigilantes in drive-by shootings or by policemen who supposedly shot them for putting up a fight during arrests. Some have been found abandoned on the streets, their bodies mutilated.
The activists urged the government to put an end to the killings, warning that growing public discontent could lead to a fate similar to that of deposed dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
They said Mr. Duterte should concentrate on solving grinding poverty, which they claimed was the root cause of the drug menace.
“The vigilante groups are being prodded by his pronouncements that encourage impunity. If you say [to the police] that ‘I have your back, just do your job,’ that is an open encouragement for these violations to continue and for gross violations of the law [to be committed],” Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay told the Inquirer.
Palabay noted that it would be wise for Mr. Duterte to “rethink” now his government policies, particularly toward human rights, or else he would soon “face challenges in his presidency.”


“Historical experience showed us that even if open fascist rule exists, the citizens still fight back,” she said, pointing to the Filipinos’ triumphant struggle against the Marcos dictatorship three decades ago.
Under Marcos’ dictatorship, 3,257 were killed, 30,000 were tortured and 70,000 were arrested for opposing his mailed-fist rule. He and his family went into exile in Hawaii in February 1986 following a bloodless revolt.
In Defense of Human Rights and Dignity Movement (iDefend) stressed it was important for the public to speak up and become the “critical opposition,” which would urge the President to do what is right and proper.
“The number of those killed in ‘Oplan Tokhang’ has increased,” added Irma Balaba of the National Council of Churches of the Philippines. She said that while the poor were grieving, the police were “having a party shooting and killing.”
“It’s said that a regime that said it espouses change is showing signs of being a fascist state,” she said.
Reject
Assistant Communications Secretary Marie Banaag stressed the government rejects extrajudicial killings, which she claimed were all being investigated by police.
Mr. Duterte, who has lashed out at critics of his antidrug campaign, had said that the vigilante-style deaths were not state-sponsored and were due to in-fighting among rival drug gangs. He has bristled at international calls for him to observe human rights, cursing US President Barack Obama, the United Nations and the European Union.
He has since softened his tone after a phone conversation with US President-elect Donald Trump, whom he said supported his unrelenting and bloody campaign.
The President recently vented his ire on human rights defenders who he said blamed him for ordering the deaths.  —WITH REPORTS FROM JOVIC YEE, LEILA SALAVERRIA AND KRISTINE FELISSE MANGUNAY

As the bodies kept piling up, “Maria,” who grieves for one of the latest victims, sighed in anguish: “I voted for someone who is now killing our own children. That’s what people are telling me nowadays.”
Afraid to give her real name in this report, Maria is a relative of Nick Villegas, a 37-year-old tricycle driver who became the 10th resident of Barangay Mangahan, Pasig, to be killed by unidentified assailants since July, according to the police. 
Earlier complaints
Villegas, a father of six, had been the subject of complaints in the barangay over his drug use and was on the local watch list of known pushers of “shabu,” said Edgardo Casili of the village security force.
He earlier surrendered to the police under the Oplan Tokhang antidrug campaign but continued using drugs, Casili said of the victim in an Inquirer interview Tuesday.
According to a report reaching Senior Supt. Orlando Yebra, Jr., the city police chief, Villegas and his live-in partner Josa Marana were knocking on the house of his father Gaudencio on Quezon Street when they were shot by one of two men on a motorbike around 1 a.m. Tuesday.
Villegas died on the spot while Marana took a hit in the stomach. She was brought to a hospital where she was set to undergo an operation.

Witnesses recalled spotting at least four motorcycle riders who were waiting in the area moments before the shooting. One rider was seen texting while another sped off apparently when he noticed he was being observed.
Barangay Manggahan desk officer Domingo Becinal said that about four hours before Villegas was shot, he was accosted by village watchmen for creating a disturbance in the neighborhood and was released around 12:50 a.m.
 
Two more Pasig kills
An hour earlier, also in Pasig, construction worker Jessie Pagaduan Jr., 34, was shot dead along Eastbank Road, Barangay Sta Lucia.
Barangay security force members told the investigator, SPO1 Hermel Vergara, that Pagaduan was included on the local drug watch list and had also  surrendered under Tokhang.
Around 7:40 p.m. Monday, Rolando Nebril, 30, was also shot dead while taking a rest inside his house that stood along a creek in Lu   pang Pari,  Barangay San Miguel, also in Pasig.
Like the other two victims in Pasig, Nebril was also a known user and pusher in the barangay, Yebra said.
In Mandaluyong, Milton Castillo, 27, was shot dead by four men on two motorcycles around 1:30 pm on Tuesday along Neptali Gonzales Street in Barangay Harapin ang Bukas, according to the local police report.
Makati attack


In Makati, Randolf Arevalo Greyon, 21, and Ace Funollera Bacorro, 18, were having a drink with friends on Rockefeller corner Binay Streets in Barangay San Isidro, when four gunmen on motorbikes appeared out of nowhere around 2 a.m.
The two back riders then pulled out pistols and fired several shots at Greyon while Bacorro and his others friends ran away. The attack was captured on a closed-circuit television camera in the area.
The shooters chased Bacorro and shot him in the chest, before fleeing toward Batangas Street.
Both victims were pronounced dead on arrival at San Juan de Dios Hospital in Pasay.
Makati police chief Senior Supt. Milo Pagtalunan, quoting barangay officials, said both suspects were suspected drug users or pushers in the area.
No record?
But the Inquirer checked the records of the Makati Police Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) and did not found the name of the victims.
A SAID officer, however, said there were two persons on its database whose information matched those of the victims, but under different first names: Steven Bacorro Arevalo, 21; and Joel Funollera Bacorro, 18; both residents of Rockefeller Street.
These two men and another Rockefeller resident surrendered under Tokhang on Aug. 24 and were listed as “occasional users”. They were not included on the drug watch list.
Different names


The SAID officer explained it was not unusual for drug personalities to alter their personal information, especially their names, when surrendering to authorities.
In Quezon City, three women and a man were gunned down in separate incidents from Monday night to early Tuesday morning, according to the police
According to a report to Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Quezon City Police District director, Gloria Melgar, 42, and Anthony Parilla, 24, were killed by mask-wearing men around 7 p.m. Monday on Kasayahan Street, Barangay Batasan Hills.
A witness, who turned out to be Melgar’s sister, was reportedly walking along the road with the two victims when one of the gunmen yelled at her: “Go away! Don’t come closer! Run!”
Drug tests
She followed the order and immediately ran, before hearing successive gunshots and later finding the victims bloodied on the pavement.
QCPD reports said Melgar and Parilla were invited to the barangay hall earlier in the day for a drug test.
In the same barangay, around Tuesday midnight, Herminia Laros, 45, was at the wake of her neighbor on Congressional Road when shot in the face also by gunmen on motorbikes. Laros died on the spot.
Two hours later, in Barangay Payatas, Analyn Baquilar-Tolentino, 41, and her companions were playing cards also at a wake on Mayon Street, when six assailants on three motorcycles opened fire on the group.
Tolentino later succumbed to multiple gunshot wounds at Far Eastern University Hospital. Four other people at the wake were also wounded.


Dumped in toilet
In Pasay, the body of a drug suspect who was also branded as a “fixer”—or someone who offers to expedite government transactions or work around regulations, usually through bribery—was found inside a toilet of a house on Electrical Road, Barangay 191, around 2 p.m.
A police report identified the victim as 44-year-old Darwin Nazareno of Barangay Halang, Naic, Cavite. A placard found next to the body carried the message: “I am a fixer, a liar, a drug user. Do not emulate.”
The owner of the house where the body was found was not immediately known.

Espinosa, 54, was arrested on Oct. 5 for illegal possession of drugs and firearms. He pleaded not to be taken to the Leyte subprovincial jail in Baybay City, saying he feared for his life there but his plea was ignored.

Under the command of Supt. Marvin Marcos, a CIDG-Region 8 team conducted a predawn operation to serve a search warrant on Espinosa, whom they suspected to be keeping a gun and “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) inside his Baybay cell.
Espinosa and another inmate, Raul Yap, were killed in the raid. The two allegedly fought it out with the CIDG team.FEATURED STORIES

On Oct. 26, prior to Espinosa’s killing, Marcos was relieved, according to Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa, after he was named by the mayor’s son Kerwin, an alleged big time drug lord, among officers receiving drug protection money. At that time, Kerwin was under arrest in Abu Dhabi, where he had fled.
Dela Rosa said he had received instructions from President Duterte to reinstate Marcos, immediately after he issued the relief order. Dela Rosa said Marcos was facing an internal affairs service inquiry anyway. 
Marcos during the Senate hearing on Dec. 5 was asked to explain the swiftness of the President’s intervention and whether he had high-level connections.
He said that the relief directive had come much earlier on a case filed against him in June and that the President probably referred to that case, not about Kerwin’s alleged revelations in Abu Dhabi.
On Nov. 7, two days after the killing of Espinosa, Marcos was relieved again on orders from CIDG headquarters in connection with the Baybay jail incident. Three days later, Dela Rosa ordered the administrative relief of all policemen involved in the death of the mayor.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson in a Senate inquiry on the case said the mayor’s killing appeared premeditated.
On Nov. 23, the younger Espinosa, in a testimony before the Senate, said that Marcos was on his payroll, receiving a total of P3 million to fund the election campaign of his wife who was running for vice mayor in May. Marcos denied this.

3 neighbors slain
One operation ended in the killing of a man known only as “Buhay” and his unidentified companion.   Another drug-bust  cornered their neighbor, 30-year-old scavenger Constantino de Juan. 
The QCPD said two .38-caliber revolvers, a .45-caliber pistol and five sachets of suspected “shabu” were recovered from the three slain suspects.
Around 7:30 p.m. in Barangay San Bartolome, a police team was scouring the area along Ivory Riverside when Alvin David, 25, suddenly pulled out a handgun and engaged the officers in a gunfight.
David was brought to Quezon City General Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.
Tokhang surrenderer
Investigation showed that David surrendered in July under Oplan Tokhang but continued using drugs. He was also being linked to robberies and motorcycle thefts in Novaliches.

The police found a sachet of shabu in David’s pocket.
Three hours later, in Barangay Bagong Silangan, garbage collectors Jerry Baldoza and Ronaldo Morales were killed also in a buy-bust operation, the QCPD said.
A “shootout” erupted between the suspects and the officers, killing Morales on the spot.
Baldoza managed to run to his house but was also shot dead by pursuing officers.
On Wednesday, Jessie Malamug was killed after allegedly firing at QCPD men in a drug sting in Barangay Greater Fairview around 2:45 a.m.

At 9:25 p.m., Jonathan Penasbo and a dozen of his friends were celebrating a birthday near his house on Block 34, Welfareville Compound, drinking the night away as they sang the Eraserheads song “Ligaya,” when four masked men approached.

Cornered inside toilet
As the strangers ordered the group to lie face down on the pavement, Penasbo and some of his friends ran away. One of the gunmen chased Penasbo up to his house, cornering him in the toilet, where the 22-year-old was shot twice in the face. 
 ‘Very wrong’
In an interview the following day, Penasbo’s mother Janet said her son did use drugs but that he did not deserve to be killed. “Maling-mali ang ginagawa ni Duterte (What Duterte is doing is very wrong),” she said, referring to the bloody war on narcotics being waged by President Duterte, whose pronouncements since the election campaign season practically endorsed vigilante-style attacks on suspected users and pushers.
As she broke down, Janet held a laminated photo of the youngest son she had just lost, taken when Jonathan  went to Quiapo church in January. She said Penasbo left behind a 4-year-old daughter.
According to a report reaching Senior Supt. Joaquin Alva, Mandaluyong police chief,  Penasbo was on the drug watch list of Barangay Addition Hills and allegedly served as a “runner” or drug courier for Eleazar Sarvida.
Sarvida, 61, was killed that same night, about five minutes after the shooting of Penasbo.

He had just arrived home in Addition Hills, after a meeting with fellow Jehovah’s Witnesses church members, when he was shot in the face by one of two men who waited for him at his front gate. He died on the spot.
One of Sarvida’s colleagues in the church maintained that the victim didn’t drink, smoke or take illegal drugs for “that’s in our rules.”
Watched by intel unit
But according to PO3 Donald Banes, the case investigator,  Sarvida was on the watch list of the city police intelligence unit, which had also received information from the barangay saying Sarvida’s wife was also into drugs.
Sarvida’s previous spouse was charged with drug pushing and died in jail, Banes said, and his son faces an arrest warrant for three counts of rape.
Around 9:45 p.m., motorcycle-riding gunmen also shot and killed Michael Desvarro, 39, near a convenience store on A. Bonifacio Street, Barangay Hagdang Bato. Desvarro, who police said peddled drugs along with cigarettes, lived a block away from Penasbo at Welfareville.
But Desvarro’s cousin, Airylyn, belied this, saying he had been eking out a living selling cigarettes, his daily struggle made harder by the fire that destroyed his house in November. Desvarro and his family had since been staying in a crowded evacuation center, Airylyn added.
An eyewitness to Desvarro’s killing said the shooter was holding a photo when he approached his target.
4th victim of the night
Around  11:30 p.m,  40-year-old Anabelle dela Cruz, a resident of Sto. Rosario Street and a drug surrenderer in Barangay Plainview, suffered the same fate.


The attack on Dela Cruz, however, also wounded 15-year-old Tenica Perez, who was walking on the same street when hit in the right leg by a stray bullet.
Dela Cruz was later pronounced dead at Sta. Ana Hospital, while Perez remained confined in another hospital for her gunshot wound.
Dela Cruz was on the barangay watch list of drug users, according to Banes.

On Monday, QCPD operations also ended in the death of four more suspects.
A man known only as Jomer was killed round 2:30 a.m. in Barangay Greater Fairview by members of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) unit of QCPD-Fairview. Jomer was described to be 25 to 30 years old and had tattoos on his arms. 
Around 7:40 p.m. that same day, a QCPD-Batasan operation on Nawasa Road, Barangay Holy Spirit, killed Joel Parian, 35, and Leo Pacula, 55. Both men were reported to be on the police watch list, with Pacula’s house on Nawasa Road allegedly being used as a drug den.
In Barangay Sauyo in Novaliches, the police conducted an entrapment operation against Henler Baduya and his brother, Lito.
But only Baduya was home when the officers entered his house at Sitio Cabuyao, where he allegedly initiated a shoot-out after a drug transaction.
The QCPD said eight sachets of shabu and a .38-caliber revolver were recovered from slain Baduya.
The incidents raised the number of drug suspects killed in police operations at 237 since July, according to Eleazar.

QCPD’s tally of “deaths under investigation” or killings carried out by unidentified assailants stands at 208. Of this number, Eleazar said, only 36 have been confirmed by investigators to be drug-related while 21 were found to have nothing to do with the war on drugs.
The remaining 151 cases are merely suspected of having links to illegal drugs, the official explained.

These are just some of the images included in the compelling photo slide show “Tokhang,” which has been making rounds on social media.
The chilling images, paired with short videos of relatives mourning and haunting background music, are from several photojournalists covering the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. 
The photographers, who are affiliated with different news organizations, work at night to document the bodies recovered from police shootouts and vigilante killings. They also cover funerals and mass surrender of drug users.
A brief background on the issue is included in the video. It states President Rodrigo Duterte’s campaign promise to rid the country of the drug trade by killing up to 1000,000 people involved in illegal drugs within six months.
“For decades, the Philippines has been plagued by poverty, rampant corruption, and stark inequality. Experts believe that the drug problem is just the symptom to more fundamental problems,” the video says.
It enumerates the results of the drug war—more than 5,000 people killed and 700,000 surrendering to authorities because they fear that they will be assassinated next. However, some of those who surrendered ended up dead as well.
“Almost all of [those killed] were small-time drug peddlers and users, and mostly citizens who live below the poverty line,” the video states.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


“Tokhang” is a term that comes from the Visayan phrase “Tok-tok Hangyo,” which has been used to refer to police knocking on doors of illegal drug suspects and asking them to surrender.
Photographers who contributed to the video are Alyx Arumpac, Dante Dionisia, Ezra Acayan, Linus Escandor, Carlo Gabuco, Jay Ganzon, Vincent Go, Czar Dancel, Raffy Lerma, Alecs Ongcal, Hannah Reyes, Dondi Tawatao. It was edited by Jes Aznar who is also a local photojournalist.
Total silence
Aznar told INQUIRER.net over the phone that he presented the video at the Angkor Photo Festival in Cambodia earlier this month.
The venue was full and many of the participants looked forward to seeing the images of Tokhang from the Philippines, he said.
Asked how the audience reacted to the video, he said there was “total silence.”
Aznar said he wanted to share with his fellow photographers images from “the most important issue in the Philippines” right now.
“We were all bothered by what’s happening and on our part we are not able to have all our pictures published. The people need to see this, the public needs to see this,” he said.
Aznar said that while photojournalists should not be political, it is their job to show the people what is really happening.
“Of course this is also a matter of life. It’s a simple ethical question… As a human being you should have a stand on that—that it is wrong if there is no due process,” he said.


“There are still a lot of people who are cynical, skeptic (and will say), ‘That is not true. That is staged,’” he said, referring to images of people killed in police shootouts and by unidentified gunmen.
So it came to a point when his fellow nightshift photojournalists wanted to bring members of the public with them.
“They need to take this seriously. We wanted to invite people with us so they can see the police operations every night. They can stay as long as they want until they are satisfied,” Aznar said.
“So we’re just doing our job. And as a human being, we’re doing our part para at least mapa-realize yung mga tao na parang may mali (to make people realize that there might be something wrong here),” he said. RAM

The Volunteers against Crime and Corruption (VACC) founding chair, Dante Jimenez, urged President Duterte to create a special task force to investigate the deaths from stray bullets, mistaken identity or accidental shooting in drug-related shootings carried out by the police and criminal syndicates.
ADVERTISEMENT







In his Jan. 3 letter to Malacañang, Jimenez said the special task force should be composed of prosecutors or commissioned lawyers who would complete the probe of the cases involving innocent victims within 30 days from the start of the investigation.
“The above recommendation will ensure that the people who have been affected by the ‘collateral’ damage will remain faithful to the government’s thrust of a peaceful and drug-free community,” Jimenez said.FEATURED STORIES

Special courts
As a complementary move, Jimenez also wrote Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to designate special courts to handle the cases involving innocent victims and monitor the cases closely to ensure that they were resolved within the prescribed period. 
Jimenez told Sereno that “an increased number of innocent people are expected to fall victims as ‘collateral damage’ in the war against illegal drugs considering the magnitude of illegal drugs in the country.”
According to the Philippine National Police, from July to December 2016, there were 2,928 deaths under investigations or murder cases not automatically connected with the war on drugs or immediately attributed as extrajudicial killings.
Mr. Duterte has apologized for the deaths of innocent victims who were caught in the crossfire.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson has urged the President to consider giving justice and  granting compensation to the innocent victims of his drug war. Lacson has suggested that Malacañang at least give burial assistance or scholarship grants to the families of the innocent victims.

Hours after Santiago was shot, an anonymous caller informed the police that he was involved in the Dec. 11 shooting of drug suspect Domingo Mañosca, 44, which also killed his son, 5-year-old Francis.
Police called in a balut vendor who testified that just before father and son were shot dead, he saw two riders on a motorcycle near Mañosca’s house. 
The vendor said the back rider got off and walked toward Mahogany Street where Mañosca lived.
The witness said he later heard gunshots and saw the suspect emerge from the alley and escape with his cohort.
SPO1 Dennis Desalisa, investigator on the Mañosca case, said the witness positively identified Santiago as the motorcycle back rider.
Investigators are still awaiting the results of the ballistics and cross-matching tests on the Norinco .45-cal. recovered from Santiago to confirm the connection.
Mañosca, a pedicab driver, had earlier surrendered to the Pasay police under the government’s “Oplan Tokhang.”

He was fixing a DVD player inside his house on Dec. 11 when someone knocked on the plywood window of their house, his wife said.
When Mañosca asked who it was, the gunman fired through the plywood panel. The bullet struck in the forehead Francis who was asleep on the floor beside his mother and two siblings.
A second bullet hit Mañosca in the nape, exiting through his cheek and killing him. His wife said he was not a pusher although he used “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to stay awake and work longer hours.

Initial police investigation showed that the victims were heading home to Barangay Pakna-an after Loberanes posted bail for possession of illegal drugs and firearms at the Mandaue City Palace of Justice in the reclamation area.
Four men on board two motorcycles blocked the path of the van, about a kilometer away from the Palace of Justice. 
Loberanes was the city’s first drug suspect who surrendered in June 2016 shortly after Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, ordered the implementation of Oplan Tokhang, a campaign in which policemen go from door to door, persuading known drug users in communities to surrender and submit to rehabilitation.
He went to the Mandaue City Police Office (MCPO) in the evening of June 8, 2016 and turned over to the Investigation and Detective Management Branch (IDMB) packs containing shabu and a pistol with ammunition.
Loberanes then told police that he wanted to start a new life.
He was later released from detention because there was no case filed against him.
But he was arrested for possession of illegal drugs and firearms on Jan. 2 after he figured in a vehicular accident along M.C. Briones Street in Barangay Basak.

When Heart’s 61-year-old mother Elena found him minutes after the killing, she lifted his head and embraced her only son.
“I tried to carry my son. I’m not sure if he’s still alive but his body was soft and warm. There were no words coming out of his mouth,” Elena de Chavez told the Philippine Daily Inquirer. 
“Then I told him ‘di ka kasi nakikinig sa amin (you did not listen to us),'” she added.
Barangay San Jose Kagawad (village councilman) Boyet de Guia said Heart was on the barangay’s drug watch list. Heart was encouraged to surrender but De Guia was not sure if he turned himself in.
De Guia said he wanted Heart’s case investigated to help identify the gunmen.
Elena said Heart started selling drugs in November 2016. He got into the business, which helped him earn P500 a day, to help feed his family.
“We already told him not to sell drugs but he said ‘ma, pangkain lang (ma, this is just to buy food),'” Elena said.

Elena and her eldest daughter Analyn de Chavez said Heart was arrested by Manila policemen in Pritil, Tondo, last Sunday. He did not have drugs at that time but they confiscated his cell phone, which contained messages of drug transactions.
Analyn said the police used that as evidence against Heart. They were not able to get the policeman’s name.
Elena added that cops in Pritil did not file a formal case against Heart “because the police asked us to pay 50,000” for his release. Elena said they could only come up with P10,000. The cops accepted the money and set Heart free.
Three days later, armed men wearing face masks and black jackets barged inside their shanty in Navotas about 11:30 p.m. They collared Heart and grabbed him outside.
Then, one of them took Heart in front of a shanty with a tiny pink door about 30 meters away. The rest stayed in front of the chapel, the only place in the alley that was well lighted.
Four shots rang.
“We saw them walk away. They were laughing,” Elena said.
Elena and Heart’s other sister Arriane called his death “brutal.”
“They shot him in the face and chest. That’s too much. That’s too brutal,” Arriane said.
The bullets pierced his brain, lungs, liver, and parts of his heart. “Just the shot in the head is enough to kill him but they still shot him several times,” Arriane said.


The De Chavezes and Sigue said the gunmen were tall and burly, and were all wearing face masks and black jackets.
While Elena talked about her son, Analyn pulled a turquoise picture frame that had two photographs and the word love. Analyn gave it to Elena who said: “look at him Mam.” Elena pointed at pictures where Heart looked and dressed like a woman. “He’s so pretty. What a waste,” Elena Saud.  SFM

After what happened on the night of Nov. 8, 11-year-old John Ryan and his nine siblings are spending their first Christmas as orphans.
They were all asleep when armed men barged into their shanty at the Market 3 area of the Navotas Fish Port Complex and grabbed Joaquin Garbo. The siblings saw how their father was dragged out of the house while still in his underwear.

John Ryan’s mother and eldest sister, aged 17, immediately went to the Station Anti-illegal Drugs (SAID) unit of the Navotas police, but the officer who faced them said Garbo wasn’t there.
Yet according to Garbo’s sister Melody, “my niece and her mother heard (Joaquin’s) voice at the station, pleading with the police not to hurt him.”FEATURED STORIES

Hours later, around 4 a.m., Joaquin was found dead on Kanduli Street in Barangay North Bay Boulevard South, his hands tied behind his back.
An official report by PO3 Allan Joey Ogatia III said the victim died of multiple gunshots. Chief Insp. Shirleen Ballete, chief of the Northern Police District crime laboratory, said three sachets of suspected “shabu” were found in Joaquin’s possession. 
‘Igaganti ko si Papa’
Melody, who was in Palawan province when she learned of Garbo’s death, admitted that her slain brother served as a drug pusher’s “runner” or courier while employed at the port as a stevedore. But more than a month after the family tragedy, she said she’s most worried about John Ryan, who had become detached, brooding, and given to tears.
The boy, she said, would often say: “Igaganti ko si Papa. Pinatay nila, kinuha nila; natutulog lang (I will avenge Papa. They killed him. They took him while he was asleep.”
“He has said that four times already,” the aunt said in an interview last week. “He’s just a boy and maybe he says things he doesn’t really mean.”
She recently saw John Ryan playing with a toy gun and aiming it at some imaginary target. She took it off his hand, telling him to stop: “That’s bad!”

“But it’s just a toy,” the boy replied. “It’s not even mine. It’s just plastic—
not like what they used to kill Papa.” The toy gun, which the boy got from a neighbor, ended up in the trash heap.
‘Beyond expectations’
While the police and the media keep count of the suspects killed in the Duterte administration’s 6-month-old war on drugs, the number of children who have lost parents as a result remains a matter of extrapolation.
Hope Hervilla, assistant secretary for protective services at the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), could only make a “conservative estimate”:
About 18,000, the DSWD official said in an Inquirer interview. “This is beyond our expectations. We did not expect it to be this big.”
Eighteen thousand children can fill up around 450 standard-size classrooms, 300 buses, or 900 jeepneys. If they are to be gathered inside Araneta Coliseum, the place would be jam-packed and about 1,500 additional seats would be required.
Grim computation
Hervilla said she arrived at the figure by multiplying 6,000—the number of people reported killed in the drug war from July to December, assuming they are all parents—by three, which she cited as the average number of children per Filipino couple.
The latest tally released by the Philippine National Police showed that its nationwide operations have killed 2,138 “drug personalities” from July 1 to Dec. 23. Going by the DSWD official’s formula, this results in 6,414 children left without a parent because of police operations.


The number of “deaths under investigation (DUIs)”—as what the PNP calls cases like Garbo’s—stands at 3,993 as of Dec. 12.
State’s responsibility
Hervilla said the DSWD would start collating data about the drug war orphans this January. An interagency meeting is set to discuss the children’s needs, the official said, as she acknowledged that there is still no government program specifically designed for such orphans.
“The children, they are the state’s responsibility,” Hervilla stressed.
Dr. Danilo Tuazon, a forensic neuro-psychologist and psychology professor, said such minors need immediate care and psychological intervention, especially if they saw how their parents were killed.
“Immediate means treatment should start right after the killing, habang nakaratay pa magulang nila (while the parent’s wake is ongoing). The children need to immediately understand what happened.”
It should include “anger management and stress debriefing” so the child may eventually cope, Tuazon said. Without it, “the damage will last a lifetime.”
“How do you tell a child that his or her parents were killed because of drug pushing but at the same time tell the kid that killing is wrong?”
Children in the prepubescent stage are most fragile, he stressed. “It is during this time that their brains are being wired on what they should become or how they should view society.”
They will never be OK


 
“At first they would seem OK, of course, because they are kids—but they are not OK. They will never be OK. Chances are they would nurse deep anger inside their hearts and it would affect them as they grow up.”
Told of John Ryan’s story, Tuazon sees “a big possibility of retaliation,” but explained that it’s “the normal reaction when you are in deep pain and angry. When you’re suffering, you want others to feel your pain, too.”
Orphans like them may need a new environment to fully recover, he said.
Which is what Melody, John Ryan’s aunt, had in mind for her 10 nieces and nephews. She wanted all of them out of their neighborhood, blaming it for their father’s involvement in drugs and his violent death.
Time to leave town
With the family’s main breadwinner gone, John Ryan was forced to find work as a harvester of mussels (tahong) in Navotas. But on Dec. 22, Melody finally decided he should no longer remain there after the boy was caught “stealing fish” from one of the trucks at the port.
When scolded, the boy explained that he just wanted to help feed his siblings.
With a friend’s help, Melody was able to secure a space for the boy on a ship going to Palawan. “He was crying when we left. He kept asking me: Who will feed my brothers and sisters?”
Thanks to another relative, three of the Garbo siblings are spending Christmas in Masbate province, while two had been adopted by one of the Garbos’ neighbors in Navotas.


Melody said she hopes to return this January for John Ryan’s three younger sisters—aged 12, 7 and 4—and move them to Palawan as well.
As to their widowed mother, Melody said she too urgently needs counseling. “I can’t even talk to her properly anymore.”
Still at the Navotas fish port community, the Inquirer also encountered Sam, a 12-year-old boy who last saw his mother on the day she was arrested along with several other residents for alleged drug peddling. The woman died of sickness while in jail.
‘Can we watch Tokhang?’
Sam wants to be a policeman someday so he can “discipline” the force.
As the interview ended and this reporter was about to leave, Sam suddenly started singing a Christmas carol, swaying his head to his own tune. This was the same boy who had just confided that “I don’t cry anymore,” that he had shed his last tears at his mother’s funeral.
Beside Sam was a 9-year-old playmate who had watched the interview. This other boy noticed this reporter’s smartphone and asked: “Ate, can we watch Tokhang on your phone?’”
Oplan Tokhang refers to the PNP campaign that has compelled thousands of suspected drug users and pushers to “surrender” and be registered so they can be referred for rehabilitation and other government interventions.
Many surrenderers, however, would later die—either at the hands of the police or unidentified gunmen. The 9-year-old apparently had this in mind, where “Tokhang” had taken a different meaning: “It’s fun watching people get shot and fall dead.”

We turn our camera lights on and we see the blood immediately—puddles of dark red beside dried yellow leaves.
Two men were killed here earlier in the evening after an “encounter” with policemen who had just finished conducting antidrug visits in the neighborhood. 
It has been more than an hour since we began our graveyard shift and left the busy streets of Makati City, where shoppers and office workers bask under the bright lights and glitter of Christmas decorations, seemingly oblivious to the spate of killings that has hit poor neighborhoods in the metropolis.
It’s the winter solstice and this night is the longest of the year, just a few days before Christmas.
Since President Duterte assumed office on June 30, more than 6,000 people have been killed—more than 2,000 shot dead in police operations and the rest murdered by unknown assailants.
Critics of the drug war believe these assailants either work for the police or are policemen themselves, taking the law into their own hands to help Mr. Duterte deliver on his campaign promise of stamping out illegal drugs in six months, which he has since extended by another six.
A number of those killed are innocent, some as young as 5 years old. Many come from poor communities.

11 p.m. Barangay Addition Hills, Mandaluyong City
Unlike the avenues of Makati, the streets in the inner city are quiet and devoid of Christmas cheer.
Aboard our vehicle, we wait for new reports of shootings, hoping to arrive before crime scene investigators process the spot and the undertaker takes the body away.
Jong Manlapaz, veteran reporter of Radyo Inquirer, receives word that there are two  bodies in Mandaluyong City.
Tope, his driver and cameraman, revs the engine and speeds through the late-night traffic to bring us to Block 34, Barangay Addition Hills.
We are the first reporters on the scene. The neighborhood is awake. People stand outside their houses, observing the police.
Bobot Sarvida was killed inside his house by unidentified gunmen. His body is wedged between the jamb and the door, which opens out to an alley.
Bobot Sarvida is shot dead by unidentified men inside his house in Block 34, Brgy. Addition Hills, Mandaluyong on December 21.
We cannot see his head, but we see his white, long-sleeve shirt stained with blood.
Neighbors say Sarvida was a Jehovah’s Witness minister and had just come home from service.
A small, black, long-haired dog stands beside Sarvida’s body, barking at us. It stays with its owner even as we leave.


Another man, Jepoy Pinasbo, was killed in the area around the same time by four unknown gunmen, but his body had already been taken to the hospital.
We ask how the two victims are related, but no one can say for sure.
According to a radio report, Sarvida was shot by the same men who killed Pinasbo after the minister witnessed the murder.
Newspaper reports the next day said Pinasbo was on the local drug watch list as a  courier for Sarvida.
Midnight, Barangay Hagdan Bato Libis, Mandaluyong City
With no time to lose, we head for a neighboring village where another man was shot dead.
Barangay Hagdan Bato Libis is a three-minute ride away and we immediately see a crowd gather around the body lying in the middle of the road, just several steps away from a 7-Eleven store.
Michael Desvarro, a 39-year-old cigarette vendor, was killed on A. Bonifacio Avenue.
Michael Desvarro, a cigarette vendor, is also killed by four men on motorcycles along A. Bonifacio Ave., Brgy. Hagdan Bato Libis, Mandaluyong.
His head is covered by newspaper. From there, my eyes move to the small pool of blood beside him and the stream of red that has flowed down the road past the police line.
Like Sarvida’s body, Desvarro’s has yet to be taken away more than an hour after he was shot dead.


Witnesses say Desvarro was gunned down at 9:45 p.m. by four motorcycle-riding men.
Another report said the gunman was holding a picture when he approached Desvarro, who police claimed had been selling drugs besides cigarettes.
Desvarro’s wife, May Anne, insists that he was not a drug addict and was instead the target of harassment by his stepfather, a Mandaluyong policeman who has gone Awol (absent without leave).
May Ann Desvarro says her husband Michael was being threatened by his stepfather who is a policeman
1:30 a.m. Barangay Plainview, Mandaluyong City
There is no rest for the weary and soon we are alerted to another shooting in a place just 10 minutes away from our third crime scene.
Press vehicles choke narrow Santo Rosario Street, where a certain Annabelle de la Cruz was shot dead by a group of assassins.
Witnesses said 10 motorcycle-riding men who wore balaclavas and black jackets came after De la Cruz.
Two of the men fired at her. A stray bullet hit a 15-year-old girl walking along the same alley.
De la Cruz, who earlier surrendered to police in response to the government’s antidrug campaign, died in hospital.
The teenager suffered a gunshot wound in the leg and was treated in hospital.


On the drive back to Addition Hills, fellow reporter Julliane de Jesus points out that multiple killings in a city in one night would have merited the setting up of checkpoints.
But there are no checkpoints tonight, only several bodies and a wounded innocent girl.
There are also no answers to our questions on whether the gunmen in the three shootings in Mandaluyong are from the same group.
2 a.m. Barangay Addition Hills, Mandaluyong City
Back at Block 34, our video reporter Cathy Miranda searches for the house where Pinasbo was killed.
A couple lets her and Tope inside the rented house where the young man had staggered into in his haste to shake off the assassins.
Video footage brought back by Cathy show blood splattered on a colorful children’s mat and a spent bullet casing inside one of the homeowner’s shoes.
The bathroom where Pinasbo was gunned down is spattered with blood. In the middle of the floor is a small candle lit by the owners of the house.
President Duterte, in a recent speech, said fewer people were being killed. “There are only a few left,” he said, referring to drug suspects.
But the killings go on.


Residents fear becoming collateral damage in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, and even for those who have surrendered, there seems to be no salvation.
In the inner cities of Metro Manila, there is no Christmas this year.
And for the families and friends of the victims, the longest night of the year has just gotten longer.

At 9 p.m. Wednesday, the masked men who were on motorcycles did not know where to find him so they fired into the two adjacent shanties in Phase 8, Barangay 176 owned by Santor’s parents.
The teenagers, along with their friends, Kenneth Lim, 20; and Edward Villanueva, 18; were in one of the shanties where a dance party was in full blast. Lim was also killed while Villanueva was wounded and taken to a hospital for treatment. 
In the other shanty, three of Santor’s relatives—his mother Cristina, 45; brother Ednel, 22; and sister Analyn, 28, who was pregnant—died. Santor, meanwhile, reportedly escaped by diving into the creek behind their house.
“My son just turned 16 and they killed him like a chicken, as if he were an animal,” said Espinosa’s mother, Maria Isabelita.
When interviewed by the Inquirer, she, along with relatives of the other victims, were standing outside Crystal Funeral Parlor where they were begging authorities to release their kin’s bodies so that they could go to another establishment with cheaper rates.
According to the teenagers’ mothers, none of their children were drug users or had criminal records. Their only fault was being friends with Santor, they added, angry at claims that the boys were involved in the drug trade.
Segovia’s father, coconut vendor Jimmy, leaned on a car for balance as he gasped for air. “My son is innocent,” he said.

Espinosa turned 16 last month while Soriano turned 16 in September. Segovia, on the other hand, just turned 15.
Just minutes before their death, they were in their respective houses. Then, Villanueva invited them to a party at the Santors’.
Abby, Soriano’s sister, said Santor’s uncle had put up a gang called Scout Royal Brotherhood and recruited the boys. It was normal for them to hang out at the Santors’ house every now and then, she added.
“But my brother does not use drugs. He does not even smoke cigarettes because one time, we caught him smoking cigarettes and we beat him up. So he stopped. Now they telling us he’s using drugs?” Abby said.
One thing the boys had in common was poverty, the reason why they were killed, according to Maria Isabelita, Espinosa’s mother.
“If the suspect is rich, they’re set free. If they’re poor, they end up sprawled on the street,” she said.
She added: “The killers who did this will never have peace. “They may escape from the law of man, but they will pay. They will pay! There is a God.”
Maria Isabelita and the other relatives had another complaint as well.  “Why do they want us to pay P40,000 when we can pay just P7,500 at another funeral home? We are poor, we don’t have money. Our children already died and they still want to rob us,” she said.
Hours after the massacre, she and the other kin of the victims were pleading with the police and employees of North Star Funeral Homes—the police-accredited funeral home which earlier picked up the dead—to turn over the bodies to them.
Since they were not given the right over their lives, maybe the families could have, at least, the right to handle their death?


When the funeral home refused, the families blocked the vehicles bearing their dead. “You cannot take them and make us pay a fortune. We have no money to pay you. Give us our dead,” said Segovia’s sister,  Jenny.
A policeman later assured the relatives that the bodies would be brought from North Star to the one they had chosen: Alexander Funeral Homes.
However, the remains were taken to Crystal Funeral Homes instead. But before the bodies could be unloaded, the victims’  families arrived and blocked the process.
Another standoff started, this one lasting from midnight to 1:45 a.m. until the police and funeral home management relented, finally releasing the victims’ bodies.

Edgar Matobato, a confessed killer and member of the so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS), said he witnessed President Duterte kill eight times, seven at the infamous Ma-a quarry in Davao City, when Mr. Duterte was mayor there.

“Sa Ma-a, siguro pitong beses (In Ma-a perhaps seven times),” Matobato told an Inquirer.net team on Monday in an interview in a safe house, referring to a district in Davao City.
He said the killings happened between 1998 and 2000. But he could neither give details of the seven nighttime incidents in the gravel quarry on the outskirts of the city nor the identities of the victims. He suggested some of the victims were criminals.FEATURED STORIES

He could only remember details of the killing of Mr. Duterte’s alleged eighth victim, a National Bureau of Investigation agent he identified only as “Amisola.”
(NBI agent Vicente Amisola was killed on Feb. 11, 1994.–Ed.) 
Matobato said the DDS was going after kidnappers when the group came upon Amisola’s vehicle blocking a narrow street. He said one of Mr. Duterte’s men got into an altercation and then a gunfight with Amisola.
He said Amisola, who rolled under his pickup truck as he was being shot, was killed by Mr. Duterte, who emptied two Uzi magazines on the NBI agent.
The Inquirer could not independently confirm Matobato’s allegations.
Matobato, 57, who has been shuttled to different safe houses in the past months because he fears for his life after publicly testifying against the President in a Senate hearing in September, sat on a green monobloc chair at the edge of a small shed where his wife cooked his meals.
Behind him is a piece of land that slopes downward, into a narrow stream—the only background the team was allowed to shoot on video.

Asked if he had firsthand knowledge of Mr. Duterte killing people, he said, “Marami na (There’s been a lot.)”
“Minsan gabi yun pumupunta basta pinakaimportante ang binabaril (Sometimes, he went to the quarry at night if the person to be shot was someone important),” he said.
“Hindi namin alam ang pangalan (We did not know the names),” he said of the victims, who were all male.
“Pumupunta yan. Sya ang bumabaril. Nakaupo ang tao (He would go there. He would fire while the person was seated).”
During the Senate justice committee inquiry on extrajudicial killings, senators made fun of Matobato as he narrated how Mr. Duterte killed the man using an Uzi submachine gun.
DIVINE GUIDANCE? Edgar Matobato holds an image of the Virgin Mary while being interviewed at his safe house by an Inquirer.net team about his killing missions. —KRISTINE ANGELI SABILLO
Last week, Matobato was interviewed by CNN for an exclusive report where he basically recounted his testimony in the Senate, implicating Mr. Duterte in the alleged activities of the DDS.
Matobato said he never saw Paolo Duterte, the President’s eldest son and now Davao City vice mayor, shoot a man. But he said Paolo asked the DDS to kill some of his enemies, including a man he argued with at a gas station.
Asked if Mr. Duterte’s other children were involved with the DDS, he said no.
Matobato said Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the President’s daughter, had criticized Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa when he was still Davao police chief because of a large number of unsolved killings in the city.
Matobato said his first kill, shortly after the DDS was formed by then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, involved shooting a suspected robber at a billiard hall called Lucky 13.


He said he simply walked up to the man and shot him at close range as bystanders ran in fear.
He said he did not wear a mask. He said in Davao City, he had nothing to fear because he was with the police.
Matobato said the people could choose to believe him or not but he said the increasing number of people being killed nationwide was proof of the existence of groups like the DDS.
Since Mr. Duterte became the President, more than 6,000 people have been killed in the war on drugs. A large number of the deaths are attributed to vigilante groups or unidentified gunmen.
Matobato pointed out that “Oplan Tokhang”—the police campaign against illegal drugs—started in Davao City.
He said the problem was that those killed were small-time drug pushers. He said the DDS did not kill any drug lord in Davao City.

CALBAYOG CITY — A barangay chief and his companion were shot dead on Thursday morning while on their way to meet Mayor Ronald Aquino of Calbayog in Samar.
Chief Insp. Angelo Pueblo, Samar provincial intelligence chief, identified the victims as Roberto Habilles Jr., 38-year-old chairman of Barangay Dinagan, and Novilito Ygbuhay, a 41-year-old farmer from the same barangay.

Pueblo said the killers left a note on the body of Habilles that read: “Oplan Tuklaw! Huwag tularan Kap adik at tulak ng druga! UGDS-EV-8.”

Pueblo said investigators were still trying to figure out what UGDS-EV-8 stood for, as it was the first time they had encountered the initials, apparently the name of a group.
According to the intelligence chief, Habilles and Ygbuhay were on their way to the Calbayog City Hall for an appointment with the mayor to discuss the possibility of Ybguhay taking over the post of his brother, a barangay kagawad, who died last month. 
Barangay Dinagan is about 15 kilometers away from the city proper.
Habilles and Ygbuhay were on a motorcycle traversing a muddy road at around 8 a.m. when unidentified men came out under cover of thick grasses and fired at them.
As the two men fell on the ground, the gunmen approached them and shot them in their faces and heads until they were almost beyond recognition.
Scene of the Crime Operatives recovered empty shells from three types of firearms – an M-16 rifle (5.56 mm), a 9-mm pistol, and a .45-caliber pistol.
Pueblos said investigators were still verifying if indeed Habilles had been using and selling illegal drugs. /ATM

The shooting incidents happened within a 35-minute period and in three areas that were quite near each other, leading the police to suspect that these were carried out by just one group. Another angle they were looking into was the three surrenderers’ possible involvement in a gang selling diluted “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).FEATURED STORIES

A report to Senior Supt. Lorenzo Holanday, Marikina police chief, said that Alvin Alcanar, 29, was standing on Narra Street in Libis Bulelak at 6:25 p.m. on Wednesday when around 11 bonnet-wearing men on six motorcycles without license plates shot him. He died on the spot.
The police recovered from the scene eight cartridges from a gun of an unknown caliber, two slugs and a sachet of suspected shabu. 
Around 20 minutes later, Renald Pangan, 33, was seated in front of a warehouse on Camia Street in Minahan Libis when he was shot by motorcycle-riding men, according to a report sent to Holanday.
Basiloy was standing nearby and was also hit. Both she and Pangan were rushed to ARMMC where the latter was declared dead on arrival.
At 7 p.m., corn vendor Nelson Ramos, 50, was cooking in the kitchen of his house on Daisy Street, Minahan Libis when unidentified men barged inside and shot him.
Ramos was brought by his relatives to Amang Rodriguez where he remains confined.
Holanday told the Inquirer that Pangan, Ramos, Alcanar had earlier surrendered to Barangay Malanday officials as drug users. The police, however, had information that they were also involved in drug pushing.

At the same time, Holanday said they were also verifying reports the three were members of a drug group which were allegedly fighting over shabu that was being diluted by adding “tawas” (alum).

Then came a sobering discovery: The bloodied body of 34-year-old Marbon Mamucod, a drug user who had earlier surrendered to barangay officials under “Oplan Tokhang.” He had been shot at least 23 times, the police said.

Mamucod was walking on the street when he was gunned down by two men on motorcycles, according to a report submitted to Eastern Police District director Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula.

Witnesses said they heard what seemed to be fireworks before they discovered Mamucod’s body sprawled on the street. “We thought we heard 13 gunshots but the police recovered 23 spent shells,” one of his relatives told the Inquirer.
Although some family members admitted that the victim was a drug user, they objected to the way he was killed. 
“It was overkill. Two shots were enough to kill him but 23? That’s too much. They could have left my brother the moment he fell but they kept on shooting. He was on the watchlist. He used drugs but that was not a license to kill him. He was slaughtered on the road like a pig,” an angry relative who refused to be identified told the Inquirer.
According to the police report, Mamucod was on the drug watchlist of Barangay Kalawaan as a drug user and pusher.
The family said they do not have an idea who would want the victim dead. He left behind three children, the youngest just 8 years old.
The family said they would not pursue a case against Mamucod’s killers for their own safety. “We will leave it to God,” a relative added.
Meanwhile, a 69-year-old drug suspect and former member of the Public Order and Safety department of the Mandaluyong City government was killed by authorities after he lobbed a grenade at them on Monday afternoon.

A report submitted to Senior Supt. Joaquin Alva, Mandaluyong police chief, identified the suspect as Johnny Montecalvo, a resident of Block 37, Barangay Welfareville Compound. He was shot dead in a buy-bust operation inside his house.
Chief Insp. Ricardo Cristobal, chief of the Mandaluyong police’s Anti-Illegal Drugs-Special Operations Task Group, said that Montecalvo was about to sell P200 worth of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to PO2 Mark Banawan when he became suspicious.
The policeman claimed that the suspect took out a grenade and threw it at him, forcing him to shoot. Fortunately, the explosive did not go off as the pin was still there, Cristobal said.
The operation was conducted in coordination with Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency agents based on a tip from residents that Montecalvo’s place was being used as a drug hub by both users and pushers.
Recovered from the scene were two sachets of shabu and illegal drug paraphernalia.

‘War on the poor’
Dechavez spoke to the Inquirer a day after London-based Amnesty International released its report on its investigation of the extrajudicial killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, accusing the Philippine National Police of paying officers and assassins to kill alleged drug offenders, planting evidence and setting up a racket with funeral homes in a “murderous war on the poor.” 
More than 7,000 suspects have been killed by police and unknown assailants since Mr. Duterte launched the crackdown seven months ago.
Amnesty warned that the killings could constitute crimes against humanity and urged the Duterte administration to investigate the murders and punish the policemen involved.
The PNP denied the allegations and Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II brushed aside Amnesty’s findings, saying criminals were not human.
She lost 2 sons
Another mother from Navotas, Maria Mesa de Parine, told the Inquirer that she lost two sons—Aljun and Danilo—four days apart—in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Rolando Paredes of Caloocan City told the Inquirer that his son, Rolando Jr., a scavenger who had no means or reason to use drugs, was killed two weeks ago by still unidentified gunmen in Tondo, Manila, in a case of “mistaken identity.”
The gunmen’s real target, he said, was a certain Reynaldo Gutierrez, the name given by police to the funeral parlor where the body of his son was taken.
The three parents joined more than 200 relatives of 70 victims of extrajudicial killings from Malabon, Navotas, Payatas and Bagong Silangan in Quezon City, and Bagong Silang in Caloocan, at the gathering, which began with a Mass concelebrated by Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez and 15 priests.
Church initiative
The Mass marks the first time the Catholic Church has gathered a big number of families of victims to publicly condemn the extrajudicial killings in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.
“There was a previous initiative by Father Nonong (Fajardo) in Adamson University,” said Fr. Joselito Sarabia, director of St. Vincent Seminary in Tandang Sora, Quezon City, and one of the organizers of Thursday’s event in Malabon.
“We are continuing that initiative, with the help of friends, benefactors and other lay people here and in other countries like France, the US, and Papua New Guinea,” he said.
Fajardo, director of the extension program of Adamson University, said the initiative began in July last year, “when the number of deaths was about 1,000. We had Mass for the victims.”
Reaffirmation of support
He said the Church continued condoling with the families of the victims, and then schools started issuing statements condemning the killings, followed by more Masses and photos of the killings exhibited on the premises of the Redemptorist Church in Baclaran, Parañaque City.


The gathering in Malabon on Thursday was for reaffirmation of support for the families of the victims, Fajardo said.
“When these families meet here, they talk to each other and their fears are somehow alleviated. They also feel that the community cares for them and their situation,” he said.
Those who had been killed left behind children, “like this 5-year-old kid,” Fajardo said, pointing to a child at the gathering. “Who will send him to school and look after his needs? So if, say, five men with their own families are killed, at least five or more children will suffer.”
The gatherings move the community to pitch in to raise money to support the children, he said.
Fajardo reiterated the need for the Church and the community to unite and help each other, and allow the families to narrate their experiences and voice out their fears during the gatherings.
Families threatened
He said the perpetrators, after killing the victims, warned the families not to say a word or they, too, would be killed.
“There were times when these perpetrators, despite wearing [balaclavas], were recognized by the victims’ families,” Fajardo said.
“I’m glad that the families are now finally coming out to speak,” he added.
Many of the families are under the care of the Vincentian congregation.


“It had to take the murder of a Korean for this drug war to stop,” Fajardo said, referring to the kidnapping for ransom and murder of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo by policemen inside PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, on Oct. 18 last year.
“But the 7,000 Filipinos killed seemed to be ignored because they were all poor. Now the [military] is being asked to police the police. If they clash, what would happen next?” he said.

William’s younger brother, 35-year-old Edicer, was killed by bonnet-wearing men on Wednesday in Pateros.

William told the Inquirer that two men barged into their house looking for Edicer while four others served as lookouts. “They told me they would just ask my brother some questions, so we were horrified to hear four gunshots.”
According to a neighbor who witnessed the killing, the victim was shot four times—twice in the face and once in the chest and nape—as he was kneeling and pleading for his life. 
“How could he be a drug pusher when he did not even have money for food?” William Sorima asked. The family, however, admitted that Edicer was an occasional drug user.
Sorima said his brother had suffered from a psychiatric disorder for nine years and that Edicer just came from a checkup at the National Center for Mental Health in Mandaluyong City.
In Barangay Manggahan, Pasig City, Joven Boñaga, 27, was on his way to buy beer at a sari-sari store on Katimugan Street, Karangalan Village, when he was shot by four men on two motorcycles around 11 p.m. on Tuesday.
Maryln Sabares, the victim’s stepsister, told investigators  that Boñaga had surrendered as a drug user under Tokhang.
A report to Eastern Police District director Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, however, said investigators were verifying if the victim was behind several theft incidents in the area.

Around the same time Boñaga was killed, another Manggahan resident was fatally shot by three men on two motorcycles.
Case investigator SPO1 Al Alvarez said 25-year-old Aldrin De Guzman was on a bicycle going to Tawiran Avenue when the assailants shot him at close range.
Like Boñaga, De Guzman, a resident of Guyabano Extension, Napico, was also in the police’s drug watch list as a user. Investigators, however, were looking into reports that he was a burglar, although his mother maintained that her slain son was just a scavenger.

There were four more drug suspects killed in police operations since the Philippine National Police (PNP) halted its war against illegal drugs on Monday, latest data from the PNP showed.
PNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa on Monday announced that all antinarcotics operations will be temporarily suspended while the PNP is focusing on weeding out bad eggs in the organization following the kidnapping-murder of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo committed by a group of rogue policemen.

But the latest tally of “Project Double Barrel Alpha” from the PNP’s national operations center (NOC) showed that since Monday, four more persons died in anti-drug operations.
Since July 1, 2016 until January 30, the PNP recorded that 2,551 drug suspects were killed in a total of 43,497 “tokhang” operations. On January 31, Tuesday, the number of suspects killed went up to 2,555 in a total of 43,593 operations.FEATURED STORIES

The PNP, however, is unsure whether the four additional deaths happened overnight or these came from belated reports that reached the NOC.
“We will see the reason why there were still individuals killed in the campaign against drugs. The chief’s order was given (on Monday) morning so baka ongoing na ‘yong police operation when the announcement was made, hindi na nila mabawi (perhaps the police operation was ongoing when the announcement was made and they cannot abort the operation),” PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos told reporters at Camp Crame on Tuesday. 
Night shift reporters, however, covering the killings since President Duterte’s drug war started in July observed that fewer persons, if not zero, were killed overnight. In the past months, reports of drug suspects being killed in the country sometimes went as high as 15 in one night.
Sought for comment, PNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, in an ambush interview, maintained that the police were not behind the killings.
Asked to explain the decline in the death toll, he said: “Ibig sabihin, nag-stop na mga vigilantes sa kanilang gawain dahil kapag ngayon tuloy tuloy sila sa ginagawa nila, pumapatay sila wherein nag-declare na ako na stop our anti-drugs operations, mayroon pa ring namamatay na gano’n, eh ‘di madali na silang habulin at ma-identify kasi sino pang gumagawa niyan.”
(This means vigilante groups have backed off because if they continue they might get caught and exposed.)
Also on Tuesday, the PNP officially deactivated the Anti-Illegal Drugs Group and all anti-illegal drug units and task groups in different police districts and stations nationwide.

In August 2016, her husband and four other men were killed in an alleged shootout with plainclothes policemen from the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) during a drug raid. The operation was part of “Oplan Tokhang,” a component of the Duterte administration’s widely criticized war on drugs.

One of the targets, Efren Morillo, miraculously survived despite a chest gunshot wound. His version of the events that night is different from that of the police: The unarmed victims were shot execution-style.
His testimony became the basis for a landmark petition filed by families of the slain men in the Supreme Court. The first legal challenge against Tokhang, the high tribunal ruled in favor of the petitioners which had sought protection from the police and the suspension of antidrug operations in their area.FEATURED STORIES

But for Maribeth, the significant victory seems hollow. “All I can think about now is getting a better job for our three children,” she told the Inquirer. “But we fear the police, those not on our side.”
Her eldest daughter is 14 years old, followed by two sons aged 12 and 4. All three were in the area when the police barged into their house, cuffed their father and his friends and led them away to a place where they would later be shot. 
While the two older children have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding their father’s death, the reasons behind it are unclear.
Maribeth, however, has other concerns. The weeks after Daa’s death on Aug. 21 saw her frantically raising P47,000 to pay for his funeral.
Now, she relies on her earnings from a small “sari-sari” (retail) store for her family’s basic needs.
To supplement her income, she moonlights as a fruit vendor from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m.
“I earn only P200 a day,” she said. Before his death, Daa was the sole breadwinner, working as a garbage collector and at times, as a construction helper.

But Ella, Jimmy and Sonny may soon lose their mother, too. Maribeth is strongly considering finding employment abroad to provide for her children.
“I don’t know what awaits me in another country. Maybe I will be a domestic helper,” she said, adding: “But at least, I will earn more.”
Despite having a solid case for filing murder charges against the police officers who killed her husband and his four friends, Maribeth seems hesitant, mainly because she is afraid.
But the Center for International Law which provided legal assistance to the petitioners expressed hope the families would continue to fight for justice.
For Maribeth, the bigger fight lies in the everyday struggle to put food on the table. In the many sleepless nights filled with dread, she holds on to one dream where her husband visited her.
“In my dream, I asked him: What do we do now? It’s so difficult,” she said in between tears. “But he told me: You can do this. You can do this.”

The mere sight of her former house where her live-in partner was shot and killed by policemen almost a month ago still makes Ruth Jane Sombrio cry.
After all, the one-room shanty on San Miguel Road in Binondo, Manila, was the reason Rogie Sebastian, a 30-year-old pedicab driver accused of being a drug pusher, ended up being one of the casualties in the government’s war on drugs.

The 40-year-old Sombrio who is seven months pregnant described her partner as a good man. He used to take drugs
but he stopped when President Duterte came into office,
she told the Inquirer in a recent interview.
“I’ve had three husbands. Rogie was the third and the kindest. The other two would beat me up but he was kind to me,” she said.FEATURED STORIES

As Sombrio recounted that fateful night, she could not help but weep. Every time she laid eyes on her old house—just meters away from where she now lives with her mother—a pained expression would cross her face.
“I can never forget how they killed him. He and I pleaded for the policemen to spare his life but they didn’t,” she said. 
The couple and their children aged 1 and 2 years old were fast asleep when uniformed and plainclothes policemen barged into their house at 3:30 a.m. on Sept. 19.
They were looking for Fernan, the shanty owner, Sombrio recalled. A friend of Sebastian’s, Fernan was also rumored to be a runner of shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride).
In their official report submitted to the Manila Police District (MPD), Binondo policemen said Sebastian died in a buy-bust operation led by Chief Inspectors Leandro Gutierrez and Fernando Reyes, and Senior Insp. Edwin Samonte.
Gutierrez is the head of the Meisic police station’s anti-illegal drug unit and Samonte, the intelligence unit chief. Reyes, on the other hand, is commander of the San Nicolas police community precinct. Both stations are in charge of keeping peace and order in the Binondo area, including San Miguel Road, a squatters’ community located beside the Pasig River.
According to the report, PO2 Juan Candelario acted as a poseur buyer and bought P100 worth of shabu from Sebastian who sensed he was a policeman. A shoot-out ensued and Sebastian, who was reportedly armed with a .38-cal. firearm, died on the spot.

Sombrio, however, recalled the events quite differently. For one thing, her partner did not own a gun.
She said that a few hours earlier, policemen on motorcycles were roaming around the area. Worried, she found it hard to fall asleep that night.
Sebastian, on the other hand, barely noticed them. He had a fever and just wanted to rest. Sebastian saw no reason to worry, he told her, because he was not Fernan.
“He was wrong,” Sombrio said. “So what was he? Palit-ulo (A substitute)?” she asked angrily.
When the police entered their house, they grabbed Sebastian and kept on asking him about Fernan’s whereabouts. With his hands up in the air, Sebastian begged for his life.
His kids were still young, he told the lawmen.
Out of fear, Sombrio said she and her partner embraced each other. The children started to cry as their parents became hysterical under the barrels of the policemen’s guns.
“Don’t leave me,” Sebastian told Sombrio.
“Then the policemen shot him in the foot and started dragging me and my kids out of the house. They said it was better for them not to see what was going to happen. I told them, ‘But you already shot him in front of them.’”
Sebastian begged the cops again: “Let me embrace my
children.”


But Sombrio and her children were taken outside their house. Moments later, gunshots rang out. Sebastian would later be found, his body riddled with gunshot wounds on the chest, head and foot.
Sombrio said she doesn’t know who killed her partner.
All she knows is that he was shot in the foot by a mannish-looking woman in plainclothes who first donned a bonnet and a pair of gloves before drawing her firearm. This “tomboy,” Sombrio told the Inquirer, was a policewoman.
When she learned that Sebastian was dead, she went into hysterics, Sombrio recalled.
She wanted to see his body to say goodbye but the authorities would not let her past the yellow tape that cordoned off her house. “I went from one policeman to another telling them that since they were planning to kill my husband, they should have brought a coffin for him, too,” she said.
“They just laughed at me. I was crying and they were laughing at me,” she added.
According to her, Sebastian’s death meant a lot of things: She lost a good man while her kids, including their unborn child, lost their father.
With the funeral home charging her P100,000 for services, Sombrio went to her friends to beg for money to claim his body and give him a proper wake. It took two weeks to come up with the money before Sebastian was finally buried at the Manila North Cemetery.
With the family’s sole breadwinner gone, Sombrio is worried about the future.
“I can’t work because I’m pregnant and no one wants to hire me. Where am I going get the money we need to survive?” she said.


As for filing a case against the police, Sombrio said this was the furthest thing from her mind.
“I want to forget everything. If I had the money, I would
go back home to the province,” she added.
She just wants to get away from the pain inflicted on her by the policemen. “They don’t have a heart or a soul, not even a conscience,” Sombrio said.
In the mornings, each time she sees policemen—whether in uniform or civilian clothes—she goes weak in the knees and cries.
The nights are harder, however, particularly for her 2-year-old son who saw his father being shot.
Sombrio said: “He cries as he looks for his father. He says, “Papa, papa. Wala na (He’s gone). Papa, papa. Bang bang.”

The brother of a woman who was shot dead in a jeepney in July was also gunned down by still-unidentified assailants outside a Makati City bar past midnight on Wednesday.

The police are looking at a possible connection between the two killings, noting that Rosales had been making follow-ups on the unsolved case of younger sister Lauren Kristel for the past several weeks.
Rosales was with a female companion waiting for a car outside Dellherts bar and restaurant at the corner of Yakal and Talisay Streets, Barangay San Antonio, when he was shot in the temple by one of the two motorcycle-riding men who approached him at 12:35 a.m.FEATURED STORIES

According to the case investigator, PO3 Rolando Villaranda, Rosales was set to return on Friday to London where he and his wife were working.
Since arriving in the country three months ago, Rosales had been checking on the progress of the police investigation into Kristel’s killing, the officer added. 
He went to the bar on Tuesday night to meet former co-workers, Villaranda said.
Around 7 a.m. on July 21, the 26-year-old Lauren Kristel was shot twice in the back by a fellow jeepney passenger at the corner of J.P. Rizal and N. Garcia (Reposo) streets, also in Makati. A stray bullet grazed the leg of another female passenger.
The police report then noted that the victim, a resident of Sta. Ana, Manila, was carrying a bag full of clothes, which her attacker didn’t touch. The .38-cal. pistol used was recovered at the crime scene.
PO3 Arnis Ojastro, who handles Lauren Kristel’s case, said Petronio constantly communicated with him and that they last spoke at 5:35 p.m. on Tuesday.
The Makati police on Wednesday formed the 10-member Task Group Rosales, with Villaranda and Ojastro among the investigators. It is headed by Supt. Angelo Germinal, the assistant police chief for operations; and Chief Insp. Rommel Resurreccion, the investigation section head.

Both Villaranda and Ojastro said their strongest lead suggested that the killings stemmed from a property dispute.

In a span of 12 hours from Wednesday afternoon to early Thursday morning, five people were shot dead in the latest series of extrajudicial killings (EJK) in Metro Manila.
They included a barangay chair in Caloocan City and four residents in Pasig City.

The Caloocan police said their investigation into the killing of Barangay 53 Chair Prolly Bolo would consider reports that he protected relatives involved in illegal drugs.
Bolo was having a drink with a friend at a junk shop on 6th Avenue in his barangay when shot by masked men on motorcycles around 3:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Senior Supt. Johnson Almazan, the city police chief.FEATURED STORIES

Almazan said his men had received reports that Bolo coddled some of his relatives involved in illegal drugs. “He gave them protection. Up to what extent? We have yet to know,” said the official, who had formed a special probe team for Bolo’s case.
In Pasig, three of the four victims were residents who were earlier included by the local police on their drug watch list. 
Still, the city’s police chief, Senior Supt. Orlando Yebra Jr., said such killings are “not to be considered alarming because (they are) happening everywhere and we have found out that in some cases the killings are perpetrated by drug syndicates.”
“We are investigating all these killings and we have leads,” Yebra stressed in a text message to the Inquirer.
In reports reaching Yebra’s office, the latest four victims were killed by unidentified gunmen in barangays Rosario, Pineda, Caniogan and Maybunga. They were as follows:
Jessie Dabon, 45, who was shot dead in his house at Masikip, Rosario, around 11 p.m. Wednesday;
Mark Anthony Pandes, 30, who was attacked while standing in front of his house along MRR Street, Pineda, around 12:25 a.m. Thursday;

Enrico Espinoza, 27, who was shot around 12:30 a.m. Thursday inside his house along Col. Licsi Street, Caniogan; and
A still unidentified man who was gunned down along Jenny Avenue Extension, Maybunga, around 4 a.m. Thursday; he was described to be 40 to 45 years old, about 5’7” tall, and wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.
Earlier, Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, director of the Eastern Police District which covers Pasig, said the spate of extrajudicial killings in the city could be the handiwork of the Boratong group, which used to operate a “shabu tiangge” or a compound in Barangay Sto. Tomas where drug peddling had gone unchecked for years until the police launched a crackdown in 2006.
In Quezon City, another drug suspect on the watch list of the Quezon City Police District’s Station 10 in Kamuning was killed in a buy-bust operation in Barangay Immaculate Conception early Thursday.
The fatality, identified only as “Fidel,” allegedly fired at the officers who had him entrapped on Aurora Boulevard corner E. Rodriguez Avenue around 1:30 a.m. The QCPD said a .45-caliber pistol, six sachets of “shabu,” aluminum foil strips, lighters and P839 in cash were recovered from the slain suspect.

Bayan Muna Representative Carlos Zarate on Friday denounced the spate of extrajudicial killings during the first 100 days of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.
In a statement, Zarate said while the campaign against drugs is a welcome development, the summary killings of drug suspects by vigilante groups also deserved condemnation.
ADVERTISEMENT







He said these killings should be investigated before they undermine the administration’s bloody crackdown on drugs.
“The relentless campaign, particularly against illegal drugs, is a welcome action considering the magnitude of this public menace, which apparently was taken for granted, if not neglected, by the previous administration. However, the now unabated summary killings allegedly perpetrated by rogue police officers, vigilantes and by members of crime syndicates must also be denounced and should be thoroughly investigated as these may in the end undermine the aggressive campaign being waged by the present administration,” Zarate said.FEATURED STORIES

“There must be no compromise with the already established rules of engagements, due process of law and human rights of alleged suspects,” he added.
Zarate, however, lauded the administration for its independent foreign policy to break away from the United States. 
President Duterte has hinted at scrapping the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement to boot out rotational US forces in the Philippines, and has said this year’s joint war games with the US would be the last.
“Giving life, spirit and credence to the Constitutional edict of pursuing an independent foreign policy, with the interest of the Filipino people and the nation as the primordial considerations. For the longest time, the Philippines has always been perceived, nay, even treated as a surrogate or vassal state and not as an ally of the US, especially in terms of its foreign policy directions,” Zarate said.
“That our past leaders have allowed such treatment is our country’s grave misfortune. But, this major foreign policy tectonic shift will restore the rightful equal place of the Philippines in the community of nations,” he added.
Zarate also commended the administration’s drive to focus on the root causes of the armed conflict in its peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front.
“The focus on addressing the historical and root causes of the armed conflict in the country is a welcome major change in the peace policy of the present administration. It is a departure from the purely capitulation and surrender mindset of the previous administrations,” Zarate said.

“Now is the opportune time to talk peace since there is a deep reserve of goodwill, seriousness and sincerity from both the government and the revolutionary groups,” he added.
Zarate, however, noted the persistent problems of traffic brought about by the “unbridled” importation and registration of cars that choke the streets, as well as the continuing neoliberal policy on privatization, commercialization and deregulation retained by the Duterte administration.
He urged the administration to fix the mass public transport system, particularly the Metro Rail Transit and Light Rail Transit systems. RAM/rga

Caagahan went after Garcia because he suspected the latter of being the police asset or informant who had told authorities about his involvement in illegal drugs, Villanuac said.
Garcia was pronounced dead Tuesday night due to brain hemorrhage. He left behind two sons — one aged six years, the other just two months old. 
According to Villanuac, the Muntinlupa police launched an antidrug operation against the 35-year-old Caagahan on Oct. 10 — a day before Garcia was shot — but failed to find their target.
Caagahan, who has been tagged by the police as a drug pusher, remains at large.
Garcia’s live-in partner, who asked not to be identified for her safety, said he was attacked while on his way to meet her and their two-month-old son that morning. He was supposed to accompany them to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for the child’s antidengue vaccination.
She said they had not seen each other for a month and Garcia just wanted to see their son when he gets an injection.
Speaking to the Inquirer, she recalled that Garcia was among those rounded up by the police under the Oplan Tokhang antidrug campaign on Oct. 8 but he was later released because there were no drugs found in his possession.

“He was too hardheaded. I already told him to distance himself from his friends who are involved in illegal drugs,” she said.

Galgo said even government prosecutors and the Commission on Human Rights have said that there had been no complaints of police excesses during these police operations.

He said law enforcers “were properly trained and knowledgeable on the rights of all crime offenders” and would pull the trigger only when suspects “violently resist using weapons that could endanger the lives of our lawmen.”
Galgo said under the Philippine National Police’s “Oplan Double Barrel,” police operatives in the provinces of north and south Cotabato, Sarangani and Sultan Kudarat, and the cities of General Santos, Cotabato, Koronadal and Kidapawan have already conducted 706 police operations as of Sept. 14. 
Among those killed during police operations were three former police officers in Tacurong City and nine “hardened” drug pushers in Matalam, North Cotabato.
He said 867 individuals had been arrested and police seized more than 1,860 sachets of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).
In the implementation of “Oplan Tokhang,” another antidrug campaign of the PNP, police in the region visited at least 29,000 homes, Galgo said.
Galgo said in the implementation of Oplan Tokhang, police in the region did not use coercive tactics but used persuasion and acted like heads of families in advising suspects to reform for their own sake.
In Cagayan de Oro City, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said government prosecutors should also focus on cases involving drug personalities.

He also urged them not to succumb to the temptation of being bribed by drug syndicates.
“Don’t let yourself be corrupted as prosecutor. Just do your job,” Aguirre said.
Aguirre said he has also required prosecutors to undergo drug testing to determine if they had been using drugs or not.  Edwin Fernandez and Jigger Jerusalem, Inquirer Mindanao

On Tuesday, reports surfaced that Choi was also involved in drugs and that she was even linked to the slain sister of actress Maritoni Fernandez, Aurora Ma. Moynihan.
“Those are just speculations but that is part of our investigation,” the QCPD chief, Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, said.  SFM

Marvin Columbino, 27, was driving along Galvez Street near the corner of Figueroa Street around 9 a.m. when he was hit in the back by a bullet apparently intended for his back rider,  case investigator SPO2 Joel Landicho said.

The gunman on a motorcycle tailed the tricycle boarded by Bravo, his live-in partner, and his grandmother after the court hearing.
The bullet hit Bravo’s left arm and body, exited from his right side and hit Columbino’s back. 
The driver was declared dead on arrival at the Pasay City General Hospital at 10:45 a.m.
Bravo was rushed to San Juan de Dios Hospital and remained in critical condition at press time.
The gunman, who was wearing a bonnet and a pair of sunglasses, fled on his motorcycle.
Last Wednesday, a drug suspect who also came from a court hearing was gunned down by a lone gunman on a motorcycle near Makati City Hall.
Rey “Jolicor” Monteroyo, 20, resident of Lanzones Street, Barangay Comembo, was walking with his live-in partner, his sister and a child when he was shot near the corner of Angono and Osmeña Streets around 11:40 a.m., the case investigator, SPO3 Rico Caramat said.

Monteroyo’s live-in partner, Maria Cristina Primo, said they were about to hail a jeepney when she heard the shot. Before fleeing, the gunman fired a second shot at Monteroyo who was already slumped on the pavement, she said.
Caramat said a bullet went through the victim’s head from the left temple. The victim also sustained a gunshot wound in the back.
Monteroyo was arrested for illegal possession of firearm and possession of illegal drugs on July 23 by members of the Makati City Police Community Precinct 9.
The investigation report of PO3 Voltaire Esguerra stated that the police were patrolling Barangay Pembo when they saw four men in a dark portion of Escuela Street.
Two men fired at the approaching patrol car before running away. A shootout ensued as the policemen stepped out of the car and chased the suspects.
The suspects entered a house on Sampaguita Street where policemen found Monteroyo with a gunshot wound in the right knee and holding a .38-cal. revolver loaded with six bullets.
When Monteroyo was frisked, police found two sachets of suspected shabu (methampethamine hydrochloride). He was brought to Ospital ng Makati for treatment.
Senior Insp. Anthony Bagsik, team leader of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group, said Monteroyo was included in the watchlist as drug pusher and a hold-up man.
Monteroyo, who was out on bail, had just attended a hearing on the illegal possession of firearm case when he was shot.  SFM

However, the suspects’ guns misfired while the operatives returned fire and wounded the two, police said.
The suspects were brought to the Pasay City General Hospital for treatment but they were pronounced dead on arrival. The bodies were moved to the Rizal Funeral Homes for autopsy. 
Crime scene operatives recovered a .38-firearm without a serial number and a 9mm gun with serial number SN 5370919F6.
Police also found a small light green container with 10 plastic sachets containing suspected shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) and two unsealed sachets with traces of suspected shabu.
Also in Pasay City, a drug suspect was shot dead by gunmen who entered his house on De Setyembre Street, Sun Valley NAIA Barangay 197 on Monday 7:10 p.m.
Two armed men wearing bonnets and caps barged in the house of Louisito Boja, 38, and riddled him with bullets while a third suspect served as lookout. The three later fled on a motorcycle.
The case investigator, PO3 Alfredo Aquino Jr., said Boja’s mother Mila had accepted her son’s fate when he continued being a drug courier despite initially surrendering under Oplan Tokhang. Boja was on the drug watchlist of the airport police community precinct.  SFM

Police recovered 11 empty shells of a .55-pistol and two deformed slugs.
Based on police investigation, Molina, a resident of Hilltop, Casili, Consolacion, was standing outside a barbeque stand when he was shot several times by three unidentified persons on board a motorcycle. 
A girl, who was standing near the place, was hit by a ricocheting bullet.
Molina earlier admitted that he peddled illegal drugs before he voluntarily surrendered to the police during the implementation of the Oplan Tokhang. Tokhang is a program of the Philippine National Police wherein policemen visit the homes of suspected drug users and pushers and encourage them to cooperate with the government and undergo rehabilitation.
Chief Supt. Noli Taliño, director of the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7), said police investigation of the shooting was still in progress as of Tuesday.
“Our investigators are looking into the case,” he said in a brief text message to the Cebu Daily News.
From July 1 to Aug. 31, eighty-nine suspected drug pushers were killed in police operations in Central Visayas, while 99 others were gunned down by still unidentified assailants.

THE CONSTITUTION is nonpolitical.
This was Associate Justice Marvic Leonen’s response to netizens who criticized him for tweeting his views Sunday on hotly debated issues currently roiling the country.

In another series of tweets on his personal Twitter account, Leonen on Monday maintained that his tweets the other day should not have been taken as political commentary from a member of the Supreme Court.
On his Twitter account @marvicleonen, he said Monday: “Law, like pure air, is colorless.”FEATURED STORIES

“The Constitution is not political commentary. It is, after all, the Constitution,” he added.
In response to user @highway54, the justice said: “legal provisions are normative statements capable of inclusion in a broad set of relevant narratives.” 
He added: “I quoted law. Law is law… Laws are legible. They are not, in the words of a critical follower, ‘crypted.’”
“Neither should it be faulted for being ‘bias,’” he said.
On Sunday, the normally reticent justice broke the so-called “dignified silence” maintained by Supreme Court magistrates when he took to social media and made known his sentiments on the bloody war on drugs and on the threat to show a supposed sex video of Sen. Leila de Lima in the House of Representatives.
On the government war on drugs which has counted over 3,000 killed since President Duterte took office on June 30, Leonen cited Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution: “no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.”
On the threat of Mr. Duterte’s allies in Congress to air De Lima’s supposed sex tape, he tweeted out Republic Act No. 9995, the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009.

He also quoted from Article II, Section 11 of the Constitution which affirms that the state shall value the “dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights.”
Leonen’s tweets generated mixed reactions from netizens, some of whom criticized him for airing his views in the public sphere.
Others, on the other hand, thanked him for “reminding” the people of the constitutional guarantees of basic freedoms.
“On point! His post is not directed to anyone or any person. It’s just that these people ‘assuming’ or guilty,” said @heyronfol.

In the morning of Aug. 23, 2010, as then President Benigno Aquino III began his 55th day in office, a dismissed Manila policeman in uniform took control of a tourist bus filled with visitors from Hong Kong.  Holding the terrified passengers at gunpoint at a parking bay in Luneta Park, Rolando Mendoza claimed he had been a victim of injustice. Through notes scribbled on cardboard, he demanded immediate reinstatement to his former position.
The Luneta incident was badly mishandled. It ended gruesomely, and quickly became an emblem of government incompetence and indecisiveness. It defined Aquino’s first 100 days as president.
ADVERTISEMENT







To recall this unfortunate tragedy is to grasp the full measure of President Duterte’s first 100 days in office. It is a record that, in an uncanny way, is also soaked in blood. But, the blood belongs to suspected drug users and traffickers, not to innocent tourists.  There is no doubt how Mr. Duterte would have dealt with the Luneta hostage-taker. He would have killed him himself.
In his inaugural speech, Mr. Duterte said that at the root of the country’s problem with drugs, criminality, and corruption was a more serious condition. He described it as “the erosion of the people’s trust in our country’s leaders; the erosion of the faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people’s lives better, safer and healthier.”FEATURED STORIES

Verging on the illegal
Acknowledging that his methods are often seen as “unorthodox” and “verg[ing] on the illegal,” he asked that his presidency be allowed “a level of governance that is consistent to our mandate.” He said that “the fight will be relentless and it will be sustained.” 
Indeed, more than anything else that has been done under this administration, it is the wanton killings in the war on drugs that the public easily associates with the first 100 days of the Duterte presidency. During this brief period, the police have chalked up 1,375 killings resulting from what they call “legitimate police operations.”  More than 2,000 other murders, mostly from poor communities, have been ascribed to vigilante-style killers.
But, there is another view. In a special report published the other day, the British newspaper The Guardian recounts its interview with an unnamed police officer who talks of the existence of 10 parallel police teams consisting of 16 members each that have been secretly carrying out vigilante-style killings. The report may be accessed here: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings.
The head of the Philippine National Police claims that, as a result of ‘Oplan Tokhang,’ more than 665,518 confessed drug addicts and 53,311 pushers have turned themselves in for rehabilitation. These are astonishing numbers. At no other time have so many ordinary people voluntarily come forward to seek help for their drug addiction. These numbers compel any government to respond with a comprehensive strategy that confronts the menace of drugs as a public health issue.
When Mr. Duterte began his campaign for the presidency, warning about the drug problem and offering himself as the nation’s last hope to end it, people were mesmerized by his tough language. But one wonders if his audiences took his urgent depiction of the drug problem seriously. What made him an overnight political sensation was his powerful presence on the stage, his irreverence, and his insult-driven way of talking. To them, he was the antithesis of the nation’s phlegmatic political elite.  He could have espoused any cause, and it would not have made any difference to them.
Consistent with the image he projects as the personification of a strong state, Mr. Duterte quickly found another area in which he could articulate his message of recuperation of the nation’s will and pride: foreign policy.  “We are no longer anyone’s lackey,” he tells his audiences.  Over the last three months he has directed his harshest tirades against US President Barack Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the European Union, and various human rights groups that have called him out on the abuses being committed by his war on drugs.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Personal pivot
In these speeches, he has called for the withdrawal of the remaining US special forces in Mindanao, the termination of Philippine participation in joint US naval patrols of the South China Sea, the suspension of US-PH joint military exercises, and a review of all mutual defense agreements with its most important treaty ally, the United States. While heaping scorn on the country’s old friends, he has signaled his own personal pivot to China and Russia.
Top defense and foreign affairs officials say that none of these statements have ripened into policy.  Evidently, none of these have been the subject of deliberation in Cabinet meetings. This appears to be the hallmark of Dutertismo: an unrestrained chief executive pronounces himself on a wide range of sensitive issues prior to any careful study by the concerned institutions of government.
Totally overshadowed by their principal, members of the Duterte Cabinet quietly plod on—building upon the work done by the previous administration and desperately looking for enduring solutions to recalcitrant problems. They are the same problems: mass poverty, unemployment and underemployment, lack of housing for the poor, inadequate health services, Metro Manila traffic, congested airport runways, unreliable mass transport system, unreleased vehicle plate numbers, etc.
Fear of a President
But, what Dutertismo has sown in the last 100 days is fear—fear of being killed, fear of a President who does not hesitate to name and shame, or publicly threaten anyone.  Fear may whip the bureaucracy into line, curb corruption in the short term, and reduce crime.  But, on the negative side, fear induces people to withhold feedback, and feedback is what any system needs to improve itself.
Mr. Duterte came to power with the promise to quickly relieve the nation of its urgent problems.  His preferred methods ignore the complexity of these pains. Rather than fix troubles, they give rise to bigger problems. Ironically, addicts turn to shabu for the same reason—to escape a difficult life they cannot comprehend.

The QCPD director, Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, confirmed that Kanahashi was one of the people they were looking for in connection with Moynihan’s death. She was found dead on Temple Drive corner Giraffe Street in Barangay Ugong Norte, Quezon City, on Sept. 10.
Footage taken by a closed-circuit television camera near the area showed her alighting from a dark gray sport utility vehicle (SUV) before she was repeatedly shot by someone inside the SUV which then sped off. 
Eleazar added that the relationship betwen Kanahashi and Moynihan were established through the text messages on the cell phone recovered from the latter. Kanahashi was also one of the last persons seen with the victim before she was killed.
Sources claimed that the victim’s family had hinted about his possible involvement in her death.
“We are determining if these links and connection are valid through a ballistic cross matching on the firearm recovered from Kanahashi’s possession,” Eleazar said, adding that a gun of the same caliber used to kill Moynihan was recovered from Kanahashi.
The suspect was reportedly a notorious drug pusher operating in Quezon City and other areas in Metro Manila, supplying shabu and party drugs.
Moynihan, on the other hand, was arrested in 2013 in a drug den in Taguig City.

A police chief on Thursday pushed for  using verbal judo to “disarm” drug suspects police personnel were about to arrest as part of the war on drugs.

“Just by your use of words, you would have overcome the enemy,” Cebu provincial director Senior Supt. Eric Noble said, pitching the use of verbal judo, which he noted was used by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in its operations.
Noble was among police regional directors who testified on details of their police antidrug operations at the last hearing of the joint Senate committees investigating alleged extrajudicial killings amid the bloody war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

PNP guideline
Sen. Gregorio Honasan II asked how policemen go about arresting drug suspects and enhancing the police guideline of “move, communicate, shoot” so that mistakes would not be committed “at the expense of human lives and this issue of extrajudicial killings would go away.” 
Honasan referred to policemen as “protector[s] of life, liberty and property,” including criminals.
Policemen have to know the use of force, in which they have basic training, according to Noble.
But Noble said policemen should adopt the training of the FBI, which makes use of verbal skills to overcome the enemy. He called this set of skills “verbal judo.”
Like Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa, Noble attended the FBI Academy and specialized in “psychological leadership” and in criminal reactions.
“We should study this verbal use of force. We should study the profiles of people to be arrested so that when we call their attention (during police operations) they would surrender right away,” the Cebu provincial director told Honasan.

Noble said this could render the use of force “unnecessary.”
Disarming with words
Policemen, according to the Cebu police chief, could use the suspect’s language and choose certain words that would coax him to surrender.
“So the suspect will be disarmed by using words,” Noble said.
He expressed hope that this kind of training would be used at the PNP Academy and regional training centers.
In Cebu province, Noble said drug suspects tended to shoot at arresting policemen right away. He said the police had seized 97 firearms, eight of which were high-powered, like M14 rifles.
So far 53 have been killed in police operations against drug suspects in the province, according to Noble.
The Cebu police are investigating the death of 52 other drug suspects, who, he said, were killed by unknown assailants.
Sen. Leila de Lima lauded Noble for his statements, saying there are other ways to neutralize suspects.
“Because killing should be the last resort. I think that’s understood by everyone,” De Lima said.

The sender, who did not give his name, claimed involvement in killings reported in nearby Bongabong town and asked the 51-year-old Luz, regional head of the Citizens Crime Watch (CCW), for help in protecting his wife and child.

Richard Albert, Luz’s live-in partner, warned her not to leave, but the woman set out past 11 p.m. on Sunday and waited for the message sender outside their house, which also served as the CCW office, in Barangay Maligaya in Gloria town.
Albert was away at the time and Luz was left with her two children and CCW staff member Mylin Licop in the house.FEATURED STORIES

“It was a decoy,” said Albert, 54, who added that his partner was unaware of the ploy.
“Knowing Zeny, she was strong outside but very soft inside,” he said, and so she went to answer the call for help. 
A motorcycle drove by and one of its riders shot Luz. The gunmen also shot her phone that fell on the ground.
Senior Supt. Christopher Birung, Oriental Mindoro police director, said several witnesses alerted the Gloria police about the killing, prompting a chase.
Pursuing policemen cornered the gunmen in Barangay Quinabigan in Pinamalayan town, about 3 kilometers away, triggering a shootout in which the  suspected assassins were wounded.
‘Tropa, tropa’
“When they fell to the ground, they began screaming, ‘Tropa, tropa (troops, troops),’” Birung said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


It turned out that the gunmen were ranking police officers—Senior Insp. Magdaleno Pimentel Jr. and Insp. Markson Almeranez.
Pimentel was relieved of his position at the Oriental Mindoro Police Public Safety Company, while Almeranez was removed as police chief of Socorro town following the attack.
Last month, Almeranez was honored as an outstanding police commissioned officer by no less than Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa during a ceremony in Calapan.
Investigation showed Pimentel, who wore a ski mask, drove the motorcycle, while Almeranez disguised himself by wearing a wig.
“Of course, the responding policemen were shocked when they realized they had shot the officers,” Birung said.
He said the involvement of the two officers, both graduates of the Philippine National Police Academy, puzzled investigators.
Murder case
The PNP on Wednesday filed a murder case against them over Luz’s death and multiple attempted murder related to the gunfight with responding policemen.
Pimentel and Almeranez, who were hit in the stomach, are recuperating in a hospital and have yet to issue statements, Birung said.
Albert said Luz  “may have angered many but she did not have any enemy.” He believed the murder was related to her work. The two also ran a small homecare products business.


As an official of CCW, Luz was working on a livelihood program for former drug users and pushers who had surrendered to authorities in response to President Duterte’s call to surrender or die in his no-nonsense war on illegal drugs. —WITH A REPORT FROM JEROME ANING IN MANILA

Of incidents, 1,298, all resulting in deaths, happened between July and September. Of the cases, 300 are resolved (policemen followed procedure) and 28 are for summary hearing (probable cause to charge for violation of PNP procedure). No murder cases filed against policemen.
Manila Police District director, Supt. Joel Coronel: From July 1 to Oct. 5,  200 drug suspects “neutralized” in police operations and 54 deaths under inquiry (DUI).  No MPD personnel involved in salvaging. Of DUI cases, nine cleared with seven suspects identified. Of suspects, four were killed in course of arrest.

Coronel says there are three motives for DUIs: nonremittance of collected drug money; turf war between rival drug syndicates; and possibility of policemen previously involved in drugs killing own sources. Of the latter, two are in active service while the rest are former policemen. There are 12-14 cases of DUIs in a month on average.
Coronel: 195 firearms of different calibers, mostly .45 cal.  pistols, seized from 200 neutralized drug offenders. All submitted to PNP Crime Laboratory.FEATURED STORIES

Coronel cites PDEA report saying Baseco in Tondo and Sampaloc are most drug-affected areas in Manila. He explains most of distribution network comes from these areas.
Drop by 49 percent in crimes vs property and even crimes vs persons since campaign started three months ago. Core of MPD campaign is supply reduction which resulted in arrest of 1,695 drug users and pushers. On average, 25 to 35 arrests everyday. Coronel says 92 percent of Manila is affected by the use of illegal drugs. Although a few barangays have been cleared, around 120 barangays. 
Sen. Panfilo Lacson asks why there are fewer firearms seized than slain drug personalities; Coronel explains there are those armed with blades.
Lacson asks PDEA to make an analysis and submit to committee why, if there is scarce supply of and low demand for narcotics, prices are still high, P1,300 to P25,000 per gram of “shabu.”
PDEA Director General Isidro Lapeña says PDEA has redefined drug affectation in barangays as seriously affected, moderately affected and slightly affected. Seriously affected means there is presence of a clandestine shabu laboratory or marijuana plantation and 20 percent of residents in the  barangay are users; moderately affected when 2 percent of persons are users; and slightly affected when less than 2 percent use narcotics. He says there is an ongoing survey in  42,000 barangays to update data based on new definition.

The two officers had been wounded in a clash with policemen who were chasing them following Luz’s killing. Pimentel and Almenarez are now suspended.
Jerry Gasco, legal researcher of CCW, said Luz was a hero in the eyes of her fellow anticrime volunteers. 
Luz’s burial pushed through despite bad weather brought by Typhoon “Karen.” At least five vehicles loaded with CCW members on their way to the burial were stranded at the Batangas City port.
One of the mourners, a former teacher, said she knew Luz to be a hardworking person.
No drug past
She has never been involved in drugs, said the former teacher, who asked that she not be identified.
Owen de Luna, National Police Commission regional officer, visited the police station here and assured Luz’s family “the law would be applied.”
De Luna commended the town police team, who chased the policemen involved in Luz’s killing, for their speedy reaction.

Witnesses had been secured, said De Luna.
Senior Insp. Ruel Lito Fronda, police chief of this town, said aside from providing security to the police team that apprehended the two policemen in Luz’s killing, members of the Luz family would also be given stress debriefing sessions.
De Luna said the killing of Luz by policemen should not lead to the condemnation of the entire police force.
The public, he said, should look at the “bigger picture” where many other policemen are faithfully doing their job, even risking their own lives.

(INQUIRER FILE PHOTO/ ROBERT DEJON)
ORMOC CITY — The killing of Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. will have a chilling effect on the other witnesses against police and government officials charged for allegedly providing protection to the illegal drugs operation run by his son, Roland “Kerwin” Espinosa Jr.
“It can instill fear among them. What is the guarantee that they are still safe?” asked Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido, Albuera municipal police chief.

Espenido was the one who convinced Espinosa to execute an affidavit and identify the government and police officials who provided protection to his son Kerwin’s illegal drug trade, the biggest in Eastern Visayas.
The mayor identified 226 names including 19 politicians, four from the judiciary, 38 policemen, seven from Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), one from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, three from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, one from the Army and three from the media.FEATURED STORIES

Separate complaints were later filed against 47 out of the 226 names at the Office of the Ombudsman, the prosecutors’ office and the Philippine National Police.
These included seven government officials including Sen. Leila de Lima, 33 police officers and seven private individuals. 
Mayor Espinosa was a vital witness to these cases.
In exchange of the affidavit, Espenido assured the mayor of his safety and allowed him to stay in his police station until Oct. 5 when he was transferred to a sub-provincial jail in Baybay City to face charges of illegal possession of firearms and drugs.
Exactly a month after his transfer to the facility, Espinosa was killed in what the Criminal Investigation Group in Eastern Visayas (CIDG-8) claimed was a shootout.
Fifteen members of the CIDG team barged into the facility at 3 a.m. on Nov. 5 to serve a search warrant on Espinosa whom they suspected to be keeping shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) inside his cell.
The CIDG-8 claimed that Espinosa shot them, prompting them to fire at him, hitting the mayor in the head, chest and stomach.

Also killed in the raid was Raul Yap, a native of Albuera who was detained on drug charges.
The raiding team recovered a .38-pistol and a pack of shabu from the cell of Espinosa and a .45-pistol, 27 packs of marijuana and 21 sachets of shabu from Yap.
Before they left, the CIDG reportedly took the hard drive connected to the close circuit television cameras.
Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Philippine National Police chief, who assured Espinosa of his safety, ordered an investigation on the shootout.
A team from Camp Crame arrived on Sunday to start their investigation on the deaths of Espinosa and Yap.

Espenido said he was surprised by the raid conducted by the CIDG on Espinosa who was killed for allegedly possessing a single firearm.
“We have conducted raids (against Espinosa) involving packs of shabu and cache of firearms. We did not harm or kill him. He eventually surrendered. But for a single firearm (he was killed)?” Espenido said.
He told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that he planned to visit the wake of Espinosa in his house in Barangay Tinago, Albuera.
“I will apologize to his family. I really thought that he would be safe if he was detained at the (Leyte sub-provincial jail) but unfortunately, he was killed,” Espenido said.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer tried to reach Supt. Marvin Marcos, CIDG-8 chief, but he declined to grant an interview.


Incidentally, Marcos’ aunt, Lalaine Jimenea, publisher of a local paper in Ormoc was one of those who were linked by Espinosa to Kerwin’s illegal drug operation.
Jimenea, who had denied the charges, was among the seven persons charged at the Regional State Prosecutor’s office in Leyte for allegedly receiving payola from Kerwin.
Aside from Jimenea, the others charged by Espenido after they were linked by Espinosa were Senator De Lima; Vice Mayor Jonah John Ungab of Ronda town in Cebu; businessmen Eufrocino “Winnie” Codilla Jr.; Victor Espina Jr., brother of former Philippine National Police officer-in-charge and retired Director
General Leonardo Espina; and retired Bureau of Jail Management and Penology warden Joseph Nuñez who was warden of the Ormoc City jail when Kerwin was previously detained.
Several policemen were also facing administrative complaints at the Regional Internal Affairs Service (RIAS).
Among them were Supt. Joey Masauding, former CIDG-8 director; Senior Supt. Jose Macanas, former Ormoc police director; and Supt.Ibrahim Jambiran, former intelligence police chief in Ormoc.
Espinosa was the prime witness in all these cases.
According to Albert Hidalgo, former president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines in Leyte, the affidavit executed by Espinosa lost its probative value with his death.
But he added the affidavit could be used to corroborate testimonies of other witnesses.
Hidalgo said the danger of using the affidavit of Espinosa in court was that it would be open to questions by the defense counsels during cross examination.
“The affidavit will just be hearsay (now that Espinosa is dead),” Hidalgo said.


Leilani Villarino, Espinosa’s legal counsel, said the family had not decided whether or not to press charges against the CIDG.
She said they would first wait for the outcome of the investigation before deciding on their next step.  SFM

The bodies terrified Betchie Salvador, because she had always known her husband could be next.
They had begun turning up all over the country ever since President Duterte launched a controversial war on drugs this year—so many that one newspaper, the Inquirer, had to create a “Kill List” just to keep track. Dealers and addicts were being shot by police or unidentified gunmen, who were dumping them on darkened streets beside cardboard signs that warned, “I’m a pusher. Don’t be like me.”

Marcelo, who worked as a driver, had been introduced to a potent methamphetamine known as shabu two years earlier by a colleague who said it helped him stay awake
at night. 
And the nation believed
 
In his campaign for the presidency, Duterte described the drug as a life-or-death threat to a nation. And the nation, exasperated by decades of crime and corruption, believed him.
It didn’t matter that government statistics showed the rate of methamphetamine use had dropped from 6.7 million in 2004 to 1.7 million today. It didn’t matter that this rate—an estimated 2 percent of Filipinos—was no higher than that of other countries like the United States or Australia in recent years. It didn’t matter that drug wars mounted in countries like Thailand or Colombia or America had failed.
 
ADVERTISEMENT
 


What mattered was that this was a cause the nation could rally around.
After Duterte was sworn into office June 30, the antidrug operation—called “Double Barrel”—began. Police drew up “watch lists” of suspected addicts and dealers, and security forces began carrying out raids. Vigilantes also went to work.
Near Marcelo’s home, a couple was found murdered in their rickshaw. Later, another man was found with his neck slashed beside a placard labeling him an addict and a thief.
The children view his remains during the wake at the family residence.
Family’s fears
By then, Marcelo’s family was starting to fear for his life. He made a living driving a tricycle, earning just enough to support their two boys, ages 6 and 7, and a newborn baby girl.  His mother, Betty Soriano, decided to accompany him to keep him safe and discourage him from doing drugs.
Marcelo also promised to quit shabu, saying it had become too dangerous. He told Betchie she didn’t have to worry “because I’m not using drugs anymore.”
At one point, a government official told Marcelo to turn himself in, a process called “surrendering” that has drawn about 700,000 drug users so far. Most are released after acknowledging their crimes and pledging never to use again.
Marcelo waved the man off, saying he had quit.
In the meantime, the number of deaths piled up: At least 1,578 drug suspects were killed by state security forces since Duterte took office, police statistics show. Vigilantes killed even more, with 2,151 murders either linked to the drug trade or classified as “unexplained.”
As a result, crime fell in some areas by nearly half, police say. But in a country that banned the death penalty a decade ago, the huge death toll has left many aghast.


“What I don’t understand is, how can—it boggles my mind—how can you actually propose that to address the problem of injustice, you perpetuate more injustice?” said Jose Luis Martin “Chito” Gascon, director of the independent Commission on Human Rights.
Men in black
On the night of Sept. 5, Marcelo parked his tricycle at a small roadside kiosk, where he had stopped to buy essentials for the morning—coffee for his family, chocolate drinking powder for his kids.
When Malvin Balingatan, who worked at the shop, leaned forward to hand him change, shots rang out, according to the police report.
It was 10:05 p.m.
As Balingatan ducked, he caught a glimpse of two men in black on a motorcycle, helmets covering their faces.
Marcelo managed to run 10 or 15 meters to the corner, where more shots were fired. He collapsed.
His mother screamed out, “My son! My son!”
At their family home, a five-minute walk away, Soriano broke the news to Betchie. Marcelo’s children appeared, woken by the chaos and the crying.
“Where’s Daddy?” one of them asked. “Where’s Daddy?”


“He’s gone,” Betchie replied, tears streaming down her cheeks.
‘What’s the point?’
By the time Betchie got to the scene, Marcelo—her Marcelo—was sprawled face-down in a pool of blood, his body lit by a halo of light from television cameras. A small translucent packet of white methamphetamines was visible beside his fingertips.
Her mother-in-law insists the drugs weren’t there when he died. She doesn’t know who put them there, or why. But she won’t press the issue with police, who say they have no leads.
“We don’t want any trouble,” she says. “What’s the point? What for?”
Betchie says she hopes they find who did this. But there is resignation in her voice. She is looking down toward her lap, eyes half closed.
Three days have passed since the shooting, and she is trying not to cry.
“I keep wondering what will happen to me, to my children,” she says, explaining that Marcelo, 39, was their family’s sole breadwinner. “All we can do now is pray.”
Outside, Marcelo’s tricycle is parked on the curb, empty and quiet. A pair of red and blue wristbands are wrapped around its headlight and speedometer, propaganda from the election campaign.
Each is inscribed with seven white letters: D U T E R T E. —AP

While police have not established links between the shootings in Molo District on Tuesday and La Paz District on Wednesday, the killings bore similarities.
Two armed men on board a motorcycle stopped in front of the victims and repeatedly shot their targets in a public place. They told bystanders to stay calm and not interfere as they were after only after the victims.
They left the scene calmly and police have not arrested any of the assailants.FEATURED STORIES

On Tuesday evening, two motorcycle-riding assailants shot dead a known theft and illegal drug suspect in Barangay San Pedro in Molo District.
Joemarie Arroyo, 46, died of several gunshot wounds including in the head and chest after he was repeatedly shot about 9:50 p.m., said Senior Insp. Mark Cordero, Molo District police chief.
Arroyo was drinking at a store along the road when the attack happened.
The passenger of the motorcycle first alighted and shot Arroyo but his gun apparently jammed. The driver then got off the motorcycle and also shot the victim apparently to make sure he was dead.
They told bystanders to remain calm and stay away before they fled.
Arroyo had been tagged in several theft cases in the community and was facing several complaints, including one for stealing donations inside the church and belongings of parishioners in parked cars, said Cordero.
Cordero added that Arroyo was a suspected drug pusher.
On Wednesday evening, two motorcycle-riding assailants also gunned down Wensher Caravana, 20, in Barangay Gustilo in La Paz District.
The assailants stopped along a street corner where Caravana was seated with three others and repeatedly shot the victim. They told the three companions of the victim to lie face down and left.
Caravan, who had nine gunshot wounds, was brought to the Western Visayas State University Medical Center but died there.
The victim was a police asset and believed to be part of a drug group, Senior Insp. Rey Sumagaysay, La Paz police chief, said.
Sumagaysay said Caravana’s killing could be due to an intra-group squabble as the victim allegedly wanted to quit the group. But he said they have also been pursuing other angles.
There have been three killings of suspected drug pushers in 12 days in the
city.
Last Oct. 8, Carcar Hablo died of gunshot wounds after he was shot by motorcycle-riding gunmen in Barangay Desamparados in Jaro district.
Hablo was a brother-in-law of Barangay Captain Noeme Hablo of Desamparados.
Police believe the killing could be business or drug-related.
An Iloilo church leader deplored the killings.
“While we support the campaign against illegal drugs and criminality, killing is against (God’s commandments). If they do not believe in God, we still have the Bill of Rights in our Constitution which guarantees the right to life,” said Monsignor Meliton Oso, executive director of the Jaro Archdiocesan Social Action Center.
While law enforcers might not be involved in the killings, Oso said threatening statements by President Duterte against drug suspects have encouraged the killings.
“He keeps on telling the drugs suspect: ‘I will kill you. I will kill you,’ which can be interpreted by policemen as a go-signal,” Oso said.
From July 1 to October 19, the Philippine National Police reported 35 violent deaths, which have been classified as “deaths under investigation,” excluding the three recent killings.
Of the 35, five are considered drug-related, another five  “suspected” drug-related and 13  undetermined.  SFM/rga

The sight of her parents’ tombs at the Tala Public Cemetery on All Saints’ Day left Linda speechless. For a moment, it brought back painful memories of how the couple, both confessed drug pushers, were murdered in front of her and her other siblings.
“I want to forget. I pray to my mother to help me forget. I always tell her: ‘Mama, please help me forget’,” the 11-year-old girl, the eldest in a brood of six, told the Inquirer in a recent interview.

On Aug. 25, armed men wearing ski masks burst into their house in Caloocan City. She and her mother, Lilia, woke up to find guns pointed at them. Lilia started pleading for their lives while waving a document proving that she and her husband, Albert, had surrendered under Oplan Tokhang.
Albert was fast asleep with Levy, his 4-year-old son, lying on his chest. Awakened by his wife’s pleas, he sat up but a bullet split his head open. Next was his wife who was also shot in the head. The armed men then left.FEATURED STORIES

Before they were killed, the couple had been planning to return to the province where they planned to start life afresh.
“I’m still having a hard time sleeping at night. I always dream about my parents and my older sister who died from rabies. In my dreams, we are happy. It’s always like that,” Linda said. “Those dreams make me miss them so much.” 
All Saints’ Day turned into a reunion of sorts for her and her five other siblings who have been living separately since the killings.
Linda has been staying with her grandmother, Fely, in another city, because suspicious-looking men on motorcycles were still roaming around their old neighborhood in Tala, Caloocan City.
Lester, her 8-year-old brother and younger sister Lulu, 5, are also in Fely’s care.
When Linda returned to Tala on Nov. 1, she ran straight into the alley leading to her aunt Mary’s house. This was where her younger brothers Levy, 4 and Lance, 2 had been staying for the past months.
She embraced the boys and placed them on her lap. She sang songs to them and kissed them repeatedly. Her 10-year-old sister Laura, who had been adopted by another relative, also came and played with them.

With the arrival of Lester and Lulu, the siblings were complete. They were clearly happy to be together as they sang, danced, rolled around the floor and embraced each other. Talk turned to who attended the most fun Halloween party.
“You should have been here. We really had fun,” Lester told Lulu. “But I had fun, too. Don’t you know, I won in a dance contest. I was the star,” she replied.
The reunion, however, was briefly halted because Fely and her three daughters wanted to leave for the cemetery. They wanted to bring all the younger children with them but Mary prevailed on them to leave Levy and Lance behind.
On their way to visit their parents, Linda took this reporter’s hand, telling her, “Please be careful, it’s really muddy here. You might slip so hold my hand.” She did not let go until it was time to leave.
In front of Albert and Lilia’s tombs, Fely and her daughters recited a novena as the couple’s four children looked on. They later urged the kids: “You can’t see them but they can see you. Talk to mama and papa. Pray for them.”
Linda then bowed her head and started to cry quietly. Before long, she was wailing, “Mama, mama, mama.”
According to Mary, they had no choice but raise the couple’s six children separately “since we are not rich.” Besides, all of them have their own children to look after, she told the Inquirer.
“Just thinking of where to get money to feed the kids makes my head spin. We’re not wealthy and we don’t have stable jobs. Every day, we try to just get by,” Mary said.
On their way to their grandfather’s tomb which was just nearby, the children started singing a song about the rain, love and loss.
As they were belting out the lyrics, Linda was smiling, happy and contented in the company of her siblings.

When policemen shot and killed Harra Kazuo’s common-law husband and her father-in-law following a drug raid, she sought one thing: justice.
In a television interview shortly after their deaths in July, the 26-year-old mother accused two officers of killing them in cold blood.

Today, she lives with her three children in hiding, sheltered by an extraordinary witness protection program run by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), which has feared for her safety while it investigates the case.
That such a program exists is powerful indictment of the lack of trust many have in the country’s notoriously corrupt police, who are spearheading an antidrug campaign that has left more than 4,000 people dead in just a few months. 
It also illustrates the failures of a broken justice system.
Kazuo said she was pushing the case because “what is happening is not right.”
“I want them to feel how they treated my husband,” she said. “I want them to feel what it’s like for a family to lose a loved one.”
Although both police officers have been suspended and have attended preliminary hearings, City Prosecutor Orlando Mariano said the two remained free and neither had been indicted.
If prosecutors determine the evidence is too weak, both men could end up being absolved.

CHR Chair Jose Luis Martin Gascon said no policeman had been charged criminally in court since the drug war began despite persistent reports of security forces summarily executing drug suspects.
Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlo, the Philippine National Police spokesperson, however, said some officers had been arrested and charged, but he could offer no details.
President Duterte unleashed his campaign to rid the country of narcotics immediately after taking office on June 30.
The effort has been praised by a population exasperated by corruption and crime, but it has been condemned by the United Nations, foreign governments and activist groups because of its staggering death toll and apparent disregard for human life.
Kazuo acknowledged that her husband was a small-time methamphetamine dealer.
But she insisted that he only pushed the drug because he could find no other work.
Just before midnight on July 6, police raided their tiny one-room apartment in a slum in Pasay City.
The officers could not find any drugs, but they hauled 28-year-old Jaypee Bertes away anyway, along with his father, 49-year-old Renato.
When Kazuo visited them at a police station the next morning, both men were severely bruised.
Hours later—after she left—they were shot dead at the end of a narrow corridor, each three times.


Police said the men were killed after one of them attempted to grab a firearm belonging to the officers.
But CHR officials, who conducted their own forensics investigation, said the detainees had been beaten so badly that they could not have done so.
One of Bertes’ arms, they said, had been broken.
It wasn’t the first time a drug suspect was fatally shot in police detention.
Last week, a town mayor detained for illegal drugs and gun possession was killed by officers in a purported gun battle in his jail cell in Leyte province.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a former Philippine National Police chief, called for an investigation and suspects the mayor, Rolando Espinosa Sr., was killed to prevent him from implicating other officials in illegal drugs.
Gascon said the officers in Kazuo’s case may have killed her husband to cover any links that could connect them to drug crimes.
Kazuo said Bertes had met the two officers she accused at least once before, when he bribed them to get out of a previous drug charge.
Silence for good reason
The families of most victims in the drug war have stayed silent for good reason.


Media reported the story of one man who had doggedly pursued justice for months for his sister, who had been killed by unidentified gunmen in Manila.
The man, who was not under CHR protection, turned up dead in late October.
“I rarely go outside anymore,” Kazuo said. “I stay inside the house, sometimes I read books, love stories … I don’t even want to go outside and walk.”
Kazuo, who has a 2-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, gave birth to a boy in September. During a visit for a prenatal checkup, someone recognized her, prompting CHR officials to switch hospitals.
The CHR is now protecting at least seven other witnesses in similar circumstances.
Its investigators are combing over 250 cases, many involving allegations that police carried out extrajudicial killings or other abuses.
They’ve received little cooperation from the PNP. An investigator assigned to Kazuo’s case said police had refused to release their autopsy report, so the commission conducted its own.
“It’ll get worse before it gets better,” Gascon said. “While [Mr.] Duterte is president, I do not believe people will be charged and held to account … so what we need to do now is to prepare the evidence for the time we can have a proper reckoning.” —AP

The subcommittee members were discussing procedural matters with regard to the questioning of resource persons from the Department of Justice, the Philippine National Police, and other stakeholders when Lagman raised the query.

Priority
The move to restore the death penalty is one of the priority legislative agenda of President Duterte’s allies in the House of Representatives.  Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said in a recent interview in Japan he hoped to see the measure pass by December. 
At Wednesday’s hearing, Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption founding chair Dante Jimenez expressed his backing for capital punishment.
He said that the argument was not a deterrent to crime was misleading. “The crime deterrence factor of the death penalty is clear in history,” he said, citing a decline in drug trafficking when a drug lord was executed during Martial Law.
“Since the dawn of civilization the death penalty in varying modes of execution and for different crimes including pickpocketing in England was an additional punishment for crimes. Is this true?” he asked.
To which Jimenez replied: “I don’t have an idea honestly… I was born in 1952.”
Irked by Jimenez’ sarcasm, Lagman said: “I will not further question this witness with this kind of answer,” prompting the presiding chair to ask the VACC leader to answer questions courteously.

Jimenez then apologized, saying he was just being honest and meant no offense.

While most Filipinos spent All Saints’ Day visiting their departed loved ones in cemeteries, the families of a young couple slain by unidentified gunmen continue to grieve over their bodies in their own homes, unable to raise the money needed for a decent burial.
Around 11 p.m. on Oct. 25, two armed men on a motorcycle shot dead Jerico Camitan, 21 and his live-in partner Erica Fernandez, 17, on Gumamela Street in Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City. A placard found on top of Camitan’s body read: “Tulak ka, hayop ka (You are a drug pusher, you animal).”

But no sachets of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) or drug paraphernalia were found at the scene. Only his cell phone, cash amounting to less than P400 and a watch were retrieved from Jerico who works as a construction worker. From Erica, a Grade 8 student, the police recovered a bloodstained Barbie doll along with a Hello Kitty wristwatch and a blue wallet.
In a recent interview with the Inquirer, the families of Jerico and Erica denied the pair’s involvement in illegal drugs. This was backed up by the police who told them that the couple had tested negative for drugs and were not on any drug watch list. Although vindicated by the findings, adding to the families’ pain is the more difficult question of where they would get the money needed for funeral and burial services.FEATURED STORIES

Rommel, Jerico’s father, told the Inquirer that it would cost over P60,000 to bury his youngest son. According to him, Light Funeral Services was charging him P46,000 for the autopsy and P12,000 for other services. On top of these, he needs to pay P5,000 for a niche at the Bagbag Public Cemetery.
“We are already very poor and they still make it so hard for us,” Rommel said, adding, “I just don’t understand.” On Nov. 3, he informed the Inquirer that the P60,000 had been lowered to P35,000, burial expenses included. 
A widower, Rommel is a construction worker in San Mateo, Rizal province earning around P600 per day. He has not been to work since his son’s death as he has been busy attending to his son’s wake which is being held in a narrow alley next to their rented house.
Rommel stays up late every night to collect contributions from neighbors playing cards at his son’s wake. On the eve of All Saints’ Day, he managed to collect P1,000, a small fraction of what he needs to raise.
“Others have told me not to get my son’s body from the morgue anymore because of the expenses,” Rommel said. “But he is my son, my poor son.”
Erica’s family is in the same situation. In their small shanty, her coffin is adorned by her favorite stuffed toy, a violet teddy bear from Jerico, said her elder sister Janet. Their neighbors have lent them a florescent bulb for Erica’s wake since there is no power in their house.
With both of her parents jobless, Erika’s relatives are at a loss on where to get the money to bury her. The funeral home is charging them P71,000 but this was later lowered to P58,000.

“We were told by Light Funeral Services to wait until Nov. 9 so we can get burial assistance from the Office of the Vice Mayor,” said Janet, who noted that the city government gives as much as P25,000. “But it is still not enough and we don’t know where we will get the rest of the money,” she added.
“If they really were drug pushers, we should be rich by now. But we don’t even have money to buy rice,” Janet told the Inquirer.
Both families said the police was looking at the third party angle. Erica reportedly broke up with Jerico a few weeks earlier and was seeing someone else.
Autopsy reports showed that Jerico was shot five times while Erica sustained a gunshot wound in the neck.
Rommel said while the Duterte administration’s war on drugs had good intentions, “not everyone who gets killed is actually a drug user. My son was an unintended casualty.”
When they finally raise enough money, the couple’s parents plan to lay them to rest beside each other.
“They were together for 3 years and they were both good kids,” Janet said.
“The funeral home told me his body can keep for only two weeks, and I have to bury Jerico next week,” Rommel said. “I don’t know what I will do with my son’s body if I don’t raise the money for his burial. I don’t even want to think about it.”

Meanwhile, police operations resulted in the death of 16 Tokhang surrenderers in Pasig, eight in Mandaluyong; 15 in Marikina and one in San Juan.
The police maintained that in most cases these suspects were cornered by teams conducting buy-bust operations, wherein they allegedly fired at the lawmen upon sensing the trap and were killed in the ensuing “shootout.” 
In an earlier interview, Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, the EPD director, noted that many suspects who had surrendered continued to be involved in the drug trade.
As of Nov. 15, the EPD has recorded 9,375 surrenderers from the four cities, of whom 244 were listed as drug pushers while the rest were counted as drug users, according to Senior Supt. Edwin de Ocampo, the EPD deputy chief for operations.
Pasig has the highest number of surrenderers with 4,019; Mandaluyong is second with 2,438; Marikina has 2023, while San Juan has 895.
Since July, 979 suspects —those who did not surrender under Tokhang but were on the drug watch list prepared by their barangays—have been arrested; 41 were killed in police operations; 14 were found dead in the streets, while 139 were killed by unidentified gunmen.
At least 1,822 drug users are currently undergoing rehabilitation, De Ocampo added.

Fifty-eight people, 32 of them journalists, were killed by soldiers, policemen and militiamen allegedly led by Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. in Ampatuan town, Maguindanao province, on Nov. 23, 2009.

Drug war victims
“This will also include the more than 3,000 who have been killed in the drug war,” Roque told a news conference in the House. 
More than 4,000 people, mostly small-time users and pushers, have been killed by police and unknown assailants since Mr. Duterte took office on June 30.
There is a need to “pass a law that would set aside a day to commemorate victims of extralegal killings, including the victims of the [Maguindanao] massacre, to stress [the government’s] resolve to fight impunity and to honor the memory of those who perished by rejecting impunity as a state policy,” Roque said in the introduction of his bill.
The wives and mothers of the massacre victims, all of whom lamented the slow progress of the case in court, attended Roque’s news conference.
“The [Maguindanao] massacre shows that our criminal justice system is not working. This is not peculiar to one administration. The Ampatuans are allies of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Former President Aquino promised justice and Leila de Lima used the Maguindanao massacre to advance her cause for human rights but nothing happened,” Roque said.
He said the families of the victims hoped to find justice during the term of President Duterte.

“All we need is one conviction to send them all to Muntinlupa,” Roque said, referring to New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City. He remains the families’ lawyer.
Roque appealed to Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 221 to resolve the case before she moves to the Court of Appeals.
There are rumors that Reyes has been promoted to appellate justice.
“She deserves to be promoted but the consideration that we need is justice. The case will need closure and a new judge would cause tremendous delay to the case,” Roque said.
Students hold protests
Journalism students of University of San Agustin in Iloilo City lit candles near the main gate of the school on Wednesday to mark the seventh anniversary of the massacre.
Journalists joined the commemoration, lamenting the slow trial of the killers.
“Failure to bring justice to slain and harassed journalists is one of the worst, if not the worst, kind of tragedy and irony a democracy like the Philippines can suffer,” said Francis Ablan Angelo, president of the Iloilo provincial capitol press corps. —WITH A REPORT FROM NESTOR P. BURGOS JR.

Bishop Joel Z. Baylon announced during Sunday Mass the ringing of church bells in Albay province every night at 9 p.m. as a signal to the faithful to pray for an end to extrajudicial killings in President Duterte’s war on drugs.
The head of the Diocese of Legazpi announced his call for “Prayers at Nine” in a letter to Mr. Duterte that was read in 45 churches throughout the province a day after the President repeated his vow to execute drug addicts, urging them to stay indoors or be silenced forever.

“We will ring the bells of our churches and chapels to call our people to prayer, to ask God to bless us all with his grace of mercy and compassion,” Baylon said.

Baylon said the ringing of bells and offering of prayers would continue for as long as necessary.
“We are in full support of your desire to eradicate this drug problem,” he told President Duterte in his letter, but he lamented the loss of 4,000 lives in the violence that had accompanied his campaign. 
“It saddens us to see that the majority of the victims are the very same poor whose lives you promised to protect and alleviate from the shackles of abject poverty,” he said.
He said the diocese had started “Harong Paglaom” (House of Hope), a community-based rehabilitation program aimed at providing recovery coaching, spiritual guidance and life skills training to substance users, in collaboration with local government units, particularly the barangays.
Speaking before judges, lawyers and fellow graduates from the San Beda College of Law on Saturday night, Mr. Duterte said:
“In the coming days, I will make it a must, that all of you who are into illegal drugs should not step out of your house … I don’t have (enough) jails. You just stay in your home and lock yourself up. If you go outside, son of a bitch, I will kill you if I see you outside.”
The President’s warning came amid the planned visit to the country of the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions Agnes Callamard, who was invited by Malacañang to “see for herself” the conduct of the Duterte administration’s ruthless drug war.

Despite repeatedly issuing such threats, Mr. Duterte had vehemently denied ordering the execution of drug suspects and blamed the criminal syndicates of purging their own ranks.
He had locked horns with officials of the United States, European Union and the United Nations for such remarks, which his critics believed were a veiled sanction for the police to engage in extrajudicial killings.
The foul-mouthed former Davao City mayor had earned the adulation of his supporters by promising to eradicate the drug problem and criminality in the country within the first six months of his administration, a vow he had failed to keep as he asked for a six-month extension in carrying out his drug campaign.
Surveys show up to 80 percent of Filipinos support his antinarcotics campaign.
As in previous gatherings, the President spent much of his 50-minute speech giving litany regarding his administration’s campaign against illegal drugs and how difficult the task was.
“I will suppress drugs. I’m doing it and believe me, until the last pusher (is) out of the streets and (the) last drug lord is exterminated, it will last until the last day of my term. I will not back down,” he said.
“While I don’t want to sound conceited, if I did not become President, the truth about our problem with illegal drugs, which is really a virulent issue and activity, will not come out,” he added.
The drug problem, Mr. Duterte said, was much more difficult to handle than terrorism. “I would rather deal with terrorism because… it’s just violence for a moment,” he said.
The President said the validated list of policemen, mayors and other government officials involved in the illegal drug trade was about several inches thick.
Mr. Duterte had earlier identified former President Fidel Ramos, who also attended the event, as the source of his so-called “narcolist.”


He said the information given to him by Ramos, whom he described as his “No. 1 critic and No. 1 supporter,” prompted him to seek the presidency.
According to the President, he would present the list of public officials behind the narcotics business in the next meeting of the National Security Council.

Concerns over the increasing number of unsolved drug-related killings were raised on Thursday during a meeting between Metro Manila mayors and Interior Secretary Mike Sueno.
Pateros Mayor Miguel “Ike” Ponce III observed during the Metro Manila Council meeting that since July, 37 drug suspects have been killed by the “bonnet gang” in his municipality without any of the perpetrators being arrested.
ADVERTISEMENT







According to him, this has discouraged those who earlier surrendered under “Oplan Tokhang” as shown by the drop in the weekly Zumba attendance from around 300 to barely 10. Surrenderers are required to attend the Zumba sessions as part of their rehabilitation.
“This is a reality that I want to bring up with Secretary Sueno and especially addressed to our police force. There are no more [drug] surrenderers; they no longer want to participate in rehabilitation programs because they are afraid,” Ponce said.FEATURED STORIES

He added that most of his constituents believed that policemen were behind the killings. “If these are carried out by vigilantes, we should arrest them. At the end of the day, we remain answerable to our constituents and they are looking for answers [to] why the killings continue.”
Mandaluyong City Mayor Carmelita Abalos agreed with Ponce, citing a case in which tandem-riding assailants shot someone near a police car but the lawmen did not go after the criminals. 
“How can we bring back the trust of surrenderers? They are willing to change but they need protection,” Abalos said.
The Metro mayors then decided to hold a closed-door session to freely discuss the issue with Sueno. Originally, the meeting was called to discuss solid waste and traffic management measures.
Sueno afterward told reporters that he would bring up the mayors’ concerns over drug-related killings with Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa.
However, he downplayed the issue, saying that Tokhang surrenderers who were subsequently killed were isolated cases. “It’s not a problem in all cities, just two or three, and we are trying to solve it,” he said.
Manila City administrator Ericson Alcovendaz, who represented Mayor Joseph Estrada, said he agreed with other mayors that the vigilante-style killings were diminishing the credibility of the government’s war against drugs.

“That’s the directive of Mayor Erap. We should put an end to the drug menace but not resort to shortcuts,” Alcovendaz told reporters.
Based on the Inquirer’s “Kill List,” a total of 1,639 people have died in the government’s ongoing war on drugs as of 12 p.m., Nov. 22. The figure includes those killed in legitimate police operations as well as those targeted by suspected vigilantes.

Lumad leaders slit the neck of a rooster in a Banwaon ritual which means “to soften the heart,” in Manila Monday in an appeal for justice for extrajudicial killings, forced evacuations and large-scale mining in Mindanao.

Gingging Anlagan, 29, from Agusan del Norte, told of how her family of three children had to flee their home three times last year because of military and mining operations.
“(The relocations) disrupt the education and cultural growth of our children,” she said. 
In an emotional speech, indigenous leader and antimining activist Erita Capion Dialang said mining company Xstrata-SMI didn’t care about the welfare of the tribal people.
Dialang is the sister Daguil Capion, who had declared a pangayaw (tribal war) against the mining company and whose pregnant wife Juvy and two children were killed in October reportedly by soldiers.
“We are here because Manila needs to listen to the marginalized peoples of Mindanao,”
said Dulphing Ogan, secretary general of Kalumaran, an alliance of indigenous tribes that headed the Manilakbayan together with Panalipdan Mindanao.
“It is ironic that Mindanao is considered the food basket, the wellspring of many natural, mineral and aquatic resources, but it is also the most neglected in terms of services, as these resources are plundered by foreign multinational corporations in cahoots with the government,” Ogan said.

People’s organizations and human rights groups met up with the delegates Monday in a salubong at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila, which was followed by a Mass at Quiapo Church, tribal dances, the beating of a gong to symbolize unity, the Banwaon ritual and a solidarity boodle lunch.
The salubong opened a series of activities that will culminate in a protest rally at Mendiola
near Malacañang to mark International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10.
Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Teodoro Casiño said he hoped President Aquino would not dismiss the Manilakbayan as “mere propaganda like he did in New Zealand a few weeks back.”
Casiño said that of the 32 documented extrajudicial killings in Mindanao since 2010, 24 were of Lumad leaders who were against mining.
“The lives of Mindanaoans are being treated as mere collateral damage for gold, plantations, mega dams, coal-fired plants and other extractive industries which the Aquino administration itself is sponsoring,” he said.

Italian priest Fausto “Fr. Pops” Tentorio was killed allegedly for his strong objection to a proposed hydropower project in the Arakan part of Pulangui River, a military officer said Thursday.
Colonel Leopoldo Galon, spokesperson of the Eastern Mindanao Command based in Davao City, said this was the initial confession of the suspect who was arrested yesterday for the murder of Tentorio in October.

“Alleged masterminds are wealthy landowners in Arakan who stand to profit from the hydropower project, which Fr. Pops alongside his ‘lumad’ organizations and other left-leaning groups are actively opposing,” Galon said in a text message.
Fr. Sebastiano D’Ambra, who belongs to the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (Pime), said he would reserve his comments on the arrest of the supposed suspect.FEATURED STORIES

He doubted claims that Ato had been identified by witnesses as the one who shot and killed Tentorio, a member of Pime.
“As far as I know there was no clear witness to the crime. Unlike Tulio (Favali) who was killed in front of many witnesses, Tentorio was killed with hardly a witness,” D’Ambra, who is based in Zamboanga City, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by text message. 
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents arrested a Jimmy Ato during a police-backed operation in Kulaman Valley village in Arakan, North Cotabato, at around 3 a.m. on Thursday, said Senior Superintendent Cornelio Salinas, North Cotabato police chief.
A military officer privy to the arrest said Ato was captured at around 5 a.m.
The military officer, who requested anonymity for lack of authority to speak on the matter, said the suspect had been brought to Cagayan de Oro City and then flown to Manila on the same day.
Galon said Ato’s brother, identified as Robert, had eluded arrest when NBI agents chanced upon the duo in Iwak-iwak sub-village.
Tentorio was preparing to leave for a clergy meeting in Kidapawan City on the morning of October 17 when attacked by a masked man.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Although Ato was wearing a crash helmet at the time of the shooting, he was seen by witnesses near Tentorio’s parish church before and after the killing, said Virgilio Mendez, chief of the NBI in Region 12.
“In fact, one of our witnesses was able to talk to him before Tentorio was murdered,” Mendez said.
Fr. Peter Geremia, a Pime missionary based in Central Mindanao, thanked authorities for the arrest of the suspected killer of Tentorio.
Identify mastermind
He said it was a positive development in the Tentorio murder case.
“The next great task is to identify who planned and masterminded Tentorio’s killing; and those who tried to cover up the case,” Geremia told the Inquirer by phone.
He said the arrest could shed light on Tentorio’s killing and encourage more witnesses to surface.
Bishop Modesto Villasanta, convenor of the Exodus for Justice and Peace, said Ato’s arrest was a piece of good news.
“Good because we will know the motive of his killing. We hope this will bring us closer to justice for Fr. Pops [Tentorio],” Villasanta said in a text message to the Inquirer.
Brief gun battle


Mendez said Robert fled on foot after engaging the arresting team in a brief gun battle.
“He was able to run away from the area after he shot at us,” Mendez said in a mobile phone interview.
Mendez said Jimmy was arrested based on a standing warrant of arrest issued by a Cotabato RTC in connection with another case for destructive arson with homicide.
He said the NBI would file  a murder case next week against Jimmy and his brother in connection with Tentorio’s killing.
“There had actually been several operations before this. We just wanted an airtight case before filing the case against the suspects,” he said.
Concrete sign
Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the arrest of Ato was a “concrete sign” that the Aquino administration had been making gains in putting an end to the culture of impunity that had abetted extrajudicial killings in the country the past several years.
“It’s gratifying to note that the landscape is now changing,” De Lima said in a text message.
She added: “I believe that this development is yet another concrete sign that we’re starting to break the culture of impunity that has long pervaded our country, thanks to the steadfast, concerted and collaborative actions among relevant law enforcement agencies.”
The justice secretary said investigators were looking at “local politics” behind Tentorio’s murder, but declined to give further details so as not to jeopardize ongoing operations against the suspect’s accomplices, including the mastermind.


“We’re also looking at the victim’s involvement in environment issues as another possible motive (in the killing),” she said.
De Lima said witnesses had pointed to Robert as the driver of the parked motorcycle which the gunman used after the fatal shooting.
Gun for hire
De Lima said the Ato brothers were suspected members of a gun-for-hire syndicate in the area.
“We’re fortunate now because of witnesses’ confidence. I believe… that in most extrajudicial killings, including those in the past, witnesses (were) unwilling to cooperate due to fear of and/or distrust in authorities,” De Lima said.
Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo welcomed the arrest of the alleged gunman but said authorities should not stop in hunting down the mastermind.
“This is not ‘case closed’ until the mastermind is not revealed. We want to know the motive behind the murder. We want to know who’s the mastermind so that we can fight the culture of impunity,” Pabillo, chair of the Episcopal Commission on Social Action, Justice and Peace, told reporters.
Pabillo thanked the NBI for the capture of the suspect. The prelate also said that he had prayed that Tentorio should be the last missionary killed in the Philippines.
“My prayer is for the mastermind to be caught so that all those thinking to commit the same crime would think twice before doing it since the government is serious [in fighting extrajudicial killings] and that government will not allow the mastermind to remain scot-free. I wish this would be the last [killing of a priest],” Pabillo said.
D’Ambra noted that more than two months after the murder, the motive remained unclear, at least to those who loved him. “We don’t know if the killing was related to mining, communist or personal vendetta because sometimes he cannot please everybody,” he said.


Suspected Red backer
The Justice for Pops Movement, which is made up of religious and cause-oriented groups, earlier expressed apprehension about a possible whitewash of the Tentorio murder case.
The group said there were indications that the military was behind Tentorio’s murder, a charge that the Armed Forces of the Philippines had repeatedly denied.
But Galon once said that Tentorio had been a suspected communist supporter.
Priests perceived as defenders of the poor and the oppressed have been tagged as suspected communists, which put their lives in danger, according to Geremia. With reports from Germelina Lacorte and Nico Alconaba, Inquirer Mindanao; and Jerome Aning in Manila

He was first assigned to the Archdiocese of Zamboanga in 1978. He was transferred to the Diocese of Kidapawan in 1980 and assigned as mission administrator to the parish of Columbio in the province of Sultan Kudarat. In 1985, he was transferred to the mission station of Arakan.
Tentorio was the third Italian priest of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (Pime) in the Philippines killed in Mindanao in the last 26 years. 
The first of the three was Tulio Favali, who was killed on April 11, 1985, by cult leader Norberto Manero in Tulunan, North Cotabato.
Manero, two of his brothers and four other accomplices barged into the San Isidro Labrador Parish, shot Favali 22 times and kicked and stomped on his fallen body. Witnesses said the killers also ate bits of the priest’s brain.
Manero was convicted of the killing and spent almost 23 years in prison before his release in 2008.
Seven years after Favali’s death, another Italian Pime priest, Salvatore Carzedda, was killed in an ambush by an unknown assailant in Zamboanga City.
Two Italian Pime missionaries, namely, Luciano Benedetti and Giancarlo Bossi, were abducted in Mindanao in 1998 and 2007, respectively.

Benedetti was kidnapped from a farm near his parish in Sibuco town. He was freed two months later, reportedly after a P7-million ransom was paid.
Bossi was on his way to say a Mass when he was kidnapped by Moro guerrillas. He was released after 39 days.
Another Italian priest, Guiseppe Pierantoni of the Priests of the Sacred Heart, was kidnapped in Dimataling, Zamboanga del Sur, on Oct. 17, 2001, while saying Mass.
At least six other foreign priests from different countries have fallen victim to armed groups in Mindanao since 1993.
Irish priest Desmond Hartford was abducted in Kolambugan, Lanao del Norte, on Oct. 27, 1997, and freed 11 days later. Irish Columban missionary Rufus Halley was shot dead after resisting a kidnap attempt in Malabong, Lanao del Sur, on Aug. 28, 2001.
While on an after-dinner stroll, Irish missionary Michael Sinnott was kidnapped on Oct. 11, 2009, in Pagadian City. He was freed 31 days later.
Spanish priest Bernardo Blanco was driving to his parish in Matarling, Basilan, on March 18, 1993, when gunmen abducted him. He escaped after 48 days in captivity.
American priest Clarence William Bertelsman was abducted by the Abu Sayyaf on July 31, 1994, but rescued after several hours.
Belgian priest Bernard Maes was taken in front of a church in Marawi on Nov. 18, 1997, and freed two days later.  Inquirer Research

Police quoted witnesses as saying Paborada was disembarking from a tricycle near his house in Puntod when he was attacked.
When his bullet-riddled body slumped on the pavement, the gunman fired at him one more time to finish him off. 
Sr. Stella Matutina, of the Missionary of Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing and secretary general of Panalipdan Mindanao, told the Inquirer that Paborada was the latest on the long list of lumad leaders slain since President Aquino came to power in 2010.
She cited the case of a lumad leader belonging to the Banwaon tribe in Barangay Balit in San Luis, Agusan del Sur, who was allegedly tortured before he was murdered, as one example.
“There is this systemic killing of lumad leaders in Mindanao in the name of development,” she said.
“I am very saddened by Paborada’s death,” she said. “This only shows a blatant display of state-sponsored murders against people fighting for their homeland,” she added. Grace Albasin, Inquirer Mindanao

“The three years of the Aquino government mark three years of injustice to my father and to the hundreds more who fell victim to extrajudicial killings under the current administration,” said Baldomero’s son, Ernan, in a statement released to mark the third death anniversary of his father on Friday.

Ernan, vice chair of Hustisya, an organization of families of victims of extra-judicial killings, lamented that no arrests have been made three years after President Aquino announced in his first State of the Nation Address that Baldomero’s case was among those the government was resolving.
“For a government that declared [itself] to be different and better than its predecessor, the outright denial of justice for my father is unacceptable, in the same way that it is unacceptable that the likes of [retired Gen.] Jovito Palparan and [former Palawan Gov.] Joel Reyes are still at large, and that the Ampatuans are allegedly offering money as settlement to the victims,” Ernan said.FEATURED STORIES

Baldomero was shot dead by a lone gunman in front of his rented house in the capital town of Kalibo in Aklan on July 5, 2010. The gunman fled on a motorcycle driven by an accomplice.
Baldomero, 61, who was the provincial chair of the partylist group Bayan Muna and a reelected Lezo town councilor, died from multiple bullet wounds. A Liberal Party member and party mate of the President, Baldomero died just four days after he assumed his second term of office. 
A murder complaint was filed at the Aklan provincial prosecutor’s office on Aug. 3, 2010, against Dindo Ancero and several unidentified persons.
Ancero, 35, a resident of Malingin, Bogo City, Cebu, was identified by witnesses as the lone gunman who shot dead Baldomero, according to investigators.
The prosecutor’s office issued a resolution on Sept. 13, 2010, finding probable cause against the suspects, and filed the information in November 2010. The case was raffled to the Kalibo Regional Trial Court Branch 2.
The court issued a warrant of arrest against Ancero on Jan. 11, 2011, but the case was archived on Oct. 7, 2011, due to the failure to arrest Ancero, according to the records of the Office of the Regional State Prosecutor.
Police Officer 3 Nida Gregas, public information officer of the Aklan Provincial Police Office (Appo), said the task of arresting Ancero was given to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group after the Appo disbanded Task Force Baldomero when it concluded the investigation on the case.

Investigators had not identified the motive in the killing of Baldomero.
But his family believed he was killed because of his activism and past involvement in the rebel movement.
Baldomero was among the youth activists who went underground in Manila shortly after martial law was declared in 1973.
He rose to become one of Panay Island’s top commanders of the New People’s Army until he was arrested in Jaro District in Iloilo City in 1993.
After his release from the Antique Rehabilitation Center following the dismissal of the criminal cases filed against him, Baldomero went home to Lezo to operate a lumber business.
He then joined politics in 1997 when he became a village councilor. He lost when he first ran as town councilor in 2004 but was successful when he ran again in 2007. He was reelected in the May 10, 2010, elections, garnering the third highest number of votes among the councilors.

Pastor Sadrach Sabella of Karapatan said the involvement of “elements of the state” in the deaths of Tony Bago and Arnel Tanduya was confirmed during the two-day fact-finding mission they conducted in the middle of July.

He said Tanduyan was also accused by soldiers of being an NPA supporter before he was killed on May 7.
“The victim had received report that he was one of the targets of the military,” Sabella said. 
Davao del Sur Gov. Claude Bautista, who still has supervision over Davao Occidental, said he has ordered an investigation into the claims of Karapatan as soon as possible.
“But I also want the killing of an alleged military asset by suspected rebels probed,” he said, citing the July 17 killing of Henry Dasal in Barangay Palian in Malita.
Senior Supt. Michael John Dubria, Davao del Sur police chief, said Dasal was brutally murdered — with his face mutilated — and his relatives were supposedly informed by the NPA that rebels were behind his death.
Efren Aksasato, spokesperson of the National Democratic Front-Far South Mindanao, had earlier admitted that the NPA had “arrested” a Henry Dasal, a 50-year-old, resident of Barangay Pinalpalan in Malita on June 15.
“We want justice for all victims regardless of their supposed affiliation. We hope to establish the exact identities of the perpetrators so that we could file charges against them in court,” Bautista told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by phone.

MANILA, Philippines—The husband of a slain human rights activist heaved a sigh of relief, on Wednesday, over the arrest of retired Major Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr., but he vowed to vigilantly pursue justice for those who were killed allegedly by Palparan under the government’s counter-insurgency campaign.
Orly Marcellana, husband of Eden Marcellana who was the secretary-general of the group Karapatan-Southern Tagalog, joined a picket protest at the National Bureau of Investigation on Taft Avenue in Manila at around 10 a.m. Wednesday, with other Karapatan members and militant groups to demand justice for their fallen comrades, whose deaths they blamed on Palparan.

Marcellana, a farmer who lives in Quezon, expressed belief that Palparan killed his wife because she was a vocal critic of the retired general. “Palparan texted her, saying that he would kill her if she ever laid a foot in Mindoro,” said Marcellana.
Eden and a peasant activist, Eddie Gumanoy, the chairman of the Katipunan ng Samahang Magbubukid sa Timog Katagalugan (Gathering of Peasant Groups in Southern Tagalog) were killed in 2003 in Oriental Mindoro.  Eden also left behind two children, both girls, ages 16 and 18.FEATURED STORIES

“Palparan claims these people were members of the New People’s Army. How can we verify that now that they are dead or missing?” said Karapatan spokesperson June Ver Mangao. 
Marcellana said that for now, he and others wanting justice for their slain loved ones could only monitor Palparan’s case.
“Palparan should not be given any kind of special treatment. If that happens, you will see more of us protesting on the streets,” said Marcellana.

Fernando Baldomero was taking his 12-year-old son to school when he was shot by two motorcycle-riding men in front of his house.
The killing of Baldomero, an activist and a municipal councilor at Lezo, Aklan province, on July 5, 2010, posed an early challenge to the then newly installed President Aquino.
ADVERTISEMENT







There were six killings during Aquino’s first week in office.
In his first State of the Nation Address (Sona) later that month, Aquino said the suspects in the Baldomero case and in two other cases had been identified. “We will not stop the pursuit of (those involved in) these killings until justice has been achieved. We will hold the murderers accountable,” he said.FEATURED STORIES

Five years later, and with Aquino’s final Sona to be delivered Monday, Baldomero’s family has not attained justice.
“It’s very ironic that his father (Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr.) was also a victim of extrajudicial killing. We had hoped that he would put a stop to impunity but the opposite has happened,” said Ernan, Baldomero’s eldest son. 
As of June 2015, there were 262 cases of extrajudicial killings, including Baldomero’s, according to the Karapatan human rights group.
“The situation is still very worrisome,” said Carlos Conde, a researcher for the Asia division of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. “While we recognize that the numbers have gone down compared with (those during) the term of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the same policy continues,” he said.
US also alarmed
The “insufficient” response of the Aquino administration on the issue of extrajudicial killings prompted Human Rights Watch and similar groups in the United States to write to the US Senate in July urging it to continue to impose restrictions on military funding for the Philippines.
“Every appropriations bill since 2008 has imposed a restriction on foreign military financing to the Philippines because of its military’s alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings,” the human rights groups said in their letter.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


They noted that activists, human rights defenders, church workers, labor organizers and antimining advocates had been targeted in Philippine military counterinsurgency operations.
Peasants are the most common victims of extrajudicial killings with 158 documented cases, followed by indigenous people with 63, Karapatan said.
License to kill 
“The pattern of abuses is very much the same with the previous regime. They are targeted, threatened, harassed and vilified as communists or communist sympathizers. That gives the military the license to kill them,” said Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay.
“Once you start red-baiting, it would be easy to kill them since the military’s mentality is that if you’re a communist, you’re an enemy, regardless of the fact that being a communist is not illegal,” Conde said.
Before he was killed, Baldomero was labeled as the leader of the communist movement in Aklan by officers of the 3rd Infantry Division, according to Ernan.
Baldomero, provincial chair of the militant Bayan Muna party-list group, was once a member of the New People’s Army. After being released from jail, he put up a lumber business and settled in Lezo.
When he was killed, he had just been reelected municipal councilor.
Who was mastermind?
Baldomero’s case has been archived at the Aklan Regional Trial Court as the suspect has not been arrested.


“Since the police have filed a case against a suspect, the killing is deemed solved. But there’s no thorough investigation to arrest the suspect and prove if it was really he who killed my father,” said Ernan, now vice president of Hustisya, an organization of families of victims of extrajudicial killings.
“I want to know who the mastermind was. Who gave the order? The suspect must have been a hired killer,” Ernan said.
According to Conde, for impunity to end, the criminal justice system must be in working order.
“There have been efforts to reform the system by declogging the courts and making the police, the courts and the Department of Justice work harmoniously. But the impact is not that significant to make a dent on the problem,” he said.
One of the campaign promises Aquino failed to keep was to revoke Executive Order No. 546. The EO, signed in 2006 by then President Arroyo, has allowed political warlords like members of the Ampatuan clan to create their own private armies “which (are) responsible for a lot of abuses,” Conde said.
Palparan’s case
According to Conde, a “plus point” for Aquino was the arrest of retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan in 2014.
Palparan has been labeled “The Butcher” by militants for his alleged role in the torture and killing of activists. He is being tried in a Bulacan court for his supposed involvement in the disappearance of University of the Philippines students Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeño.
The students’ families and activists protested the “rock star treatment of the Butcher” when Palparan was transferred from the Bulacan jail to the military barracks in Taguig City.
Palabay also lamented that farmer-activist Jonas Burgos and others who disappeared during the Arroyo administration remain missing. Every year, Edita Burgos, Jonas’ mother, reminds Aquino of his promise to find out the truth about her son’s disappearance.


With the promotion of military officials implicated in these abuses, “we think this last year of Mr. Aquino will be a bloody one in terms of human rights violations,” Palabay claimed.
She said the military’s counterinsurgency campaign was missing the point. “Killing protesters is not the way forward. The way forward is to institute meaningful reforms to resolve the economic crisis,” she said.
Human Rights Watch is looking into two other tracks of extrajudicial killings—media killings and summary executions by death squads.
Last chance
“This cannot go on, this breakdown of law and order,” Conde said. “If the rule of law works, the government should be able to prosecute military personnel who are implicated. It can (also) prosecute politicians, police officers implicated in the killings of journalists (and) ordinary citizens.”
In a statement, Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Aquino’s final Sona was his best and last chance “to demonstrate that his human rights commitments are not empty political rhetoric.”
“President Aquino’s record on human rights is five years of squandered opportunity,” Kine said.
Task Force Usig
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) Chair Jose Luis Martin Gascon claimed there was a marked decline in extrajudicial killings from 2010 to 2014, compared to the years before the Aquino administration. But he conceded the murders had not stopped despite the administration’s concerted efforts to stop them because of the slow rate of convictions and the culture of impunity.
“The perpetrators believe they can evade prosecution,” Gascon said.


Data from the Philippine National Police showed that from July 1, 2010, there had been 11 cases of activists killed because of their work or ideological inclinations. The PNP’s Task Force Usig is mandated to monitor cases of extrajudicial or political killings, as well as murders of journalists.
Of the 11 cases, four have been filed in court while two are in the preliminary investigation stage. Four are now considered to be “cold cases.”
There were also 14 cases of mediamen killed in the same period, which the PNP said were considered an attack on press freedom. Ten of the cases are with the courts while one has resulted in a conviction.
Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 35 creating a committee to handle extrajudicial killings and other human rights violation cases.
“The challenge is to see that the actions taken result in convictions and to completely stop (the killings),” Gascon said.
The CHR has quick reaction teams to assist people whose rights or lives are under grave threat. It also investigates extrajudicial killings.
According to Gascon, the CHR is also the convenor of the National Monitoring Mechanism that works with human rights advocates and law enforcers to monitor the prosecution of cases and bring attention to new ones.
‘Political bossism’
The PNP and the Armed Forces have also set up their own human rights affairs offices.
Gascon said these were some of the steps the administration had taken to address the problem as the President promised in his 2010 and 2011 Sonas.


But it would require the concerted efforts of all stakeholders to create a robust justice system, he said.
“Other reforms must begin (to stop) this culture of impunity, such as political bossism, proliferation of loose firearms and the breakdown of law and order,” he said.
Losing hope
Baldomero’s family deplored the government failure to solve his murder.
“(The President) promised that he will be given justice. But no one has been arrested,” Ernan said.
He said his family was losing hope those behind the murder would be punished because “even the President’s promise has not been good enough.”
On Aug. 3, 2010, the Aklan police filed a murder complaint against Dindo Ancero, a resident of Bogo City in Cebu, and unidentified men in connection with the murder.
The RTC later ordered the arrest of Ancero but the case was archived due to the authorities’ failure to arrest Ancero.
Protest actions
“As the most powerful person in the country, (Aquino) can very well ensure that my father’s killers are caught along with the mastermind. But he has failed to do so,” Ernan said.


Baldomero’s family and colleagues had blamed military agents or hired assassins for the killing.
Baldomero’s unsolved murder will be among the issues to be raised in protest actions during the Sona. Protests will be held in Iloilo, Capiz and Aklan.
In Estancia town in Iloilo, about 1,000 mostly survivors of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) will also join a protest rally to decry the failure of government to distribute housing assistance to survivors.
Typhoon survivors will also join rallies in Aklan and Capiz, according to Bayan.

“So that’s why the Commission on Human Rights is really asking for more support so that we might be able to address these cases,” Gascon said.
He pointed out a recent case in Central Luzon where a juvenile who was under detention was later found dead. 
“These things should not be the norm,” the CHR chief said, “So while the overall cases have dwindled, the fact that there are sharp increases in enforced disappearance, extrajudicial killings and torture [are] a matter of concern.”
Gascon could not immediately provide, however, the number of cases recorded by the CHR but said it has a database system on such incidents.
“Pero ang matingkad since 2005 onwards, e nag-increase overall although this year, sa usapin ng enforced disappearance, zero,” he further said.
(It’s clear that from 2005, onwards, the cases have increased overall, but this year, zero enforced disappearance has been reported.)
During the hearing on the proposed budget of the CHR, Gascon also told the committee that new reports of extrajudicial killings are recorded almost on a weekly basis. IDL

Trillanes said the tough-talking mayor shared the story during a meeting set up by a “common friend” in April last year for a possible tandem in the May 9 national elections. Duterte was not yet announcing his plans to run for president at that time. 
The soldier-turned-senator said he took Duterte’s word that he would not vie for the highest national elective post in the land.
“Kasi ako vice presidential candidate, I was shopping around for a principal also, as a prelude to the decision to the group ngayon nagkausap kami, eh sa palagay ko nung  simula’t sapul  di nagsabi siya sa akin diretiyahan ‘ay kasi ‘di ako tatakbo talaga (but when we talked, he told me directly that he won’t run for president.)),’” he said.

Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat sought an inquiry in aid of legislation on the spate of “extrajudicial killings” of suspected criminals at the start of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.
In House Resolution No. 61, Baguilat, a member of the Liberal Party, called on Congress to investigate the “spate of extrajudicial killings and/or summary executions of suspected violators of laws on illegal drugs and other suspected criminals.”

He also cited Article III, Section 14 paragraph 1 which reads “No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.”
Baguilat also said the charter states that “in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved…” 
Bagulat said since Duterte assumed office on June 30, at least 23 persons suspected of violating laws against illegal drugs were killed by law enforcers “under vague circumstances.”
He added that even before Duterte’s inauguration, at least 68 drug suspects were killed in police operations in the country from January 1 to June 15, and 25 more were killed from June 16 to 20, “demonstrating a shocking increase in police-perpetrated killings.”
Meanwhile, the Philippine National Police reported 22 suspected drug-related killings outside police operations from May 14 to June 30, Baguilat said.
Baguilat said the spate of summary killings on the hands of the police who were mandated to enforce the rule of law is a violation of the constitutional right of suspected criminals.

“The seemingly unchecked outbreak of extrajudicial killings executed by civil servants trusted by the people to enforce the law indicates a violation of the Constitution…” Baguilat said.
Baguilat also said the extrajudicial killings represent a “deterioration of the rule of law which can lead to people taking the law into their hands,” thereby leading the country towards the path of “lawlessness and anarchy.”
“There is therefore a clamor from the public and government officials alike to look into the disturbing trend of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug criminals,” Baguilat said.
“It behooves Congress, as the people’s instrument for securing social order through the establishment of just laws and thus the rule of law, to scrutinize the circumstances behind the aforementioned killings, with a view to ensuring that the people’s rights and lives are protected, especially by law enforcers,” he added.
Baguilat expressed alarm over the summary killings of criminals, a quick fix supported by President Duterte to eradicate criminality and illicit drug abuse in the country. IDL

His backup team then moved in and sealed his shooters’ doom.
The Quezon City Police District (QCPD) gave this account of the “encounter” that left four crime suspects dead early Monday morning—and also brought to 12 the number of persons killed by lawmen in the city since the Duterte administration took over.

The death toll kept rising just as the Senate was being asked to investigate the surge in killings attributed to police operations, wherein the officers always maintained that they only fired back at the suspects in self-defense.
The four men killed on Monday were allegedly the remnants of a syndicate involved in drug dealing, car theft and robbery. The QCPD chief, Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, identified them as Earl Oronio Javier, Ignacio Dela Cruz Rana, an alias John and a Jake.FEATURED STORIES

They were tagged as members of the Salvacion Briones crime group that operated in Metro Manila and nearby Bulacan and Cavite provinces.
They were supposed to be entrapped by the District Anti-illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group in a buy-bust operation in the wee hours of Monday on C.P. Garcia Avenue near Magiting Street, Barangay UP Campus. 
At 1:15 a.m., PO3 Joebert Garcia, the designated poseur buyer, met with the suspects who arrived at the area in a silver Toyota Innova. They were supposed to sell him 50 grams of “shabu” worth P100,000.
According to a report prepared by Garcia, he was about to call his backup unit hiding nearby when the suspects pulled out handguns and fired at him, hitting him in the back. He escaped unharmed, however, because he was wearing a bulletproof vest.
Ignacio and Earl were killed on the spot by the responding officers after an exchange of gunfire, while the two other suspects were able to flee “on a motorcycle,’’ Garcia said.
But the two men on the bike were later cornered on Maharlika Street near Elliptical Road. The QCPD said they were asked to surrender but still fired at the pursuing team.
The QCPD said the four suspects were carrying four .45-cal. pistols, and in their vehicle they kept a kilo of shabu, a weighing scale, a stainless steel spoon and  five aluminum foil strips.

Eleazar described them as members of a group whose leader, Briones, and accomplices Aswanie Dipatuan, Albert Monitor and Amilojack Briones were arrested late last year.
The QCPD chief on Monday said 12 drug suspects had been killed in police operations in the city since July 1. He stressed that the suspects initiated the gunfights.
Since the start of the month, 273 drug users and peddlers have been arrested by the QCPD, while more than 2,000 voluntarily surrendered to their respective barangay officials and were turned over to the district command, the official added. With reports from Jenele Mane and Pam Castro

Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) Secretary General Renato Reyes Jr. said that due process and human rights must prevail.

“Bayan reiterates its opposition to extrajudicial killings and summary executions of suspected drug dealers. Due process and human rights should always be upheld in the conduct of police operations. The summary execution of a suspected drug pusher in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, in broad daylight on a busy street, shows the degree of impunity that persists today,” Reyes said in a statement.
He was referring to the killing of Macario Ignacio, 45, of Bitas village in Cabanatuan City who was shot by a motorcycle-riding gunman in the afternoon of July 6. The incident was caught on a CCTV camera. Local police said that Ignacio was previously linked to illegal drugs and “carnapping” activities.FEATURED STORIES

Reyes urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) to determine if the killings were being done by criminal syndicates or were part of legitimate anti-drug operations. 
“We call on the authorities to uphold the inaugural message of the President where he declared that his adherence to due process will be uncompromising.”
“More than going after street level dealers, efforts at identifying and prosecuting the protectors of criminal syndicates at the highest levels of government should be intensified,” he said.

“Who are we to say they were hopeless and that they should die?” said Bishop Broderick Pabillo in his 14-minute homily at a Mass  on Monday at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Ermita, Manila, which marked the launch of the Church’s “Huwag Kang Papatay” (Thou Shall Not Kill) campaign.

When the authorities took their lives, they were deprived of their right to repent and change their lives, Pabillo said.
“They were sacrificial lambs just so the [government] could say it’s succeeding. Never forget them (victims),” said Fr. Atilano Fajardo, director of the Archdiocese of Manila’s ministry of public affairs.FEATURED STORIES

The Mass was intended to stir the public into grieving and praying for the families of the slain victims. Supporters of the campaign flocked to the church in black but none of the victims’ relatives showed up.
“They’re scared to come forward,” Jojo Roberto, the lay coordinator of the Church’s ministry on public affairs, told the Inquirer. 
Roberto said that among the three family members invited, only one confirmed but backed out before the 5 p.m. Mass.
Fajardo said hundreds of people were killed so the real culprits would go unpunished. But what’s alarming to the Church was not only the spate of killings, but the silence of the public.
“It’s only OK until your family becomes the victim. You may change your mind after that, but then it would be too late,” Pabillo said in a separate interview.
Pabillo said the Catholic Church launched its campaign for fear the act of killing would eventually become acceptable as the culture and norm for the Filipino people.
They also wanted to remind the public that the country’s crime rate would not go down if the solution employed was committing another form of crime—murder.

“We are not even sure if those killed were really criminals because there was no due process. How can we believe that?” said Pabillo.
At the end of the Mass, the churchgoers lit candles and offered flowers for the victims’ souls.
“They have souls, too. We are forgetting that they have souls,” said Fajardo.
Sympathizers flocked to the church to express sympathy for the relatives and express support for the campaign.
Edna Yanga, a teacher at De La Salle in Lipa City, said those who remain silent on the killings must realize they could be next.
“If we keep silent on this issue, it would seem that we are agreeing,” Yanga said.

Buhay Representative Lito Atienza on Wednesday urged President Rodrigo Duterte to address the brutal summary killings of suspected drug pushers that hark back memories of the atrocities under martial law.
The horrifying scenario of slain drug suspects with faces covered with masking tape, hogtied and dumped on the streets of the metropolis has the same feel of the atrocities and human rights violations during the regime of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos when he imposed martial law, the pro-life lawmaker said during the press conference of the minority bloc.

“Ang nangyayari sa (what is happening in) summary killings, I cannot agree with that, in the same manner I rejected martial law because of that. Ang daming pinatay (Many were killed)… Abuse is happening every day, similar to those dark days of martial law,” Atienza said.FEATURED STORIES

“Walang kalaban laban ang mga suspek (The suspects were killed without a fight),” he added of the summary killing of victims.
Atienza acknowledged that the dictator declared martial law at the time thousands of communist rebels are going up the mountains, but Duterte has to become wary of what’s going on if he does not want to suffer the same downfall as that of Marcos. 
The dictator was toppled in a people’s uprising in Feb. 1986 that propelled to power the late president Corazon “Cory” Aquino, the widow of the opposition senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. who was slain during the Marcos regime.
“The command responsibility will take over the good intentions of the president. Eventually, he’ll be blamed for all of these, in the same way we blamed Marcos for martial law,” Atienza said.
“I want him to succeed. He should take note of what’s going on. Hindi tama ito (This is not right), it must be corrected immediately,” he added.
Atienza said Duterte may not even be aware of the abuses committed by the police who claimed the drug suspects were killed for resisting arrest.
“’Yung patayan na nangyayari (The killings that are taking place), he may not even be aware of that… That’s why we keep on reminding him, ‘You better check, Mr. President. That’s why Marcos failed, you may fail if you’re not able to correct this. You’re well intentioned, legal orders are given, but if these abuses continue, aabot tayo dun sa sukdulan (we might resort to extreme measures),'” Atienza said.

Atienza said he cautioned the president against a possible downfall as that of Marcos because he does not want the president to fail in his war against drugs.
“Ayoko naman pumalpak si Pangulong Duterte. Maswerte tayo na nagkaroon tayo ng presidenteng ganito (I do not want President Duterte to fail. We are fortunate to have a president like him),” he added.
Atienza made the statement at the height of the divisive issue about Duterte’s go-signal to give Marcos a hero’s burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, despite the latter’s history of abuse and plunder during his two-decade regime. IDL

MANILA — Five mothers who sit in the House of Representaives and belong to the Liberal Party ‎have asked the Duterte administration to “reassess” its bloody battle against  ‎illegal drugs, which has also spawned an alarming number of summary killings.
The LP lawmakers led by  Batanes Rep. Henedina Abad joined party mate, Ifugao Rep.

The petition was signed by Abad, Negros Oriental Rep. Josie Limkaichong, Bataan Rep. Geraldine Roman‎, Occidental Mindoro Rep. Josephine Sato, and Dingat Islands Rep. Kaka Bag-ao.

The rights to a fair trial, due process and justice “belong appropriately to all Filipinos, whether they be victims or suspects of a crime, whether they be rich or poor,” according to the legislators.
The LP lawmakers, who are part of the majority coalition in the House, also demanded a stronger statement from the House leaders to denounce all illegal measures to fight drug trafficking.

“The summary executions are a false solution. In the long term, human rights abuses can only hurt our country and its potential for genuine peace and prosperity,” said the lawmakers.
Amid the loud protests from international human rights groups against the slaughter being carried out by the police and vigilantes, the LP lawmakers noted the lack of public outcry against the rising body count.

“KILL drugs, not people.”
That is the message of Jennilyn Olayres to President Duterte, whose war on illegal drugs had taken the life of her husband, Michael Siaron.

Olayres (not Olaires as earlier reported) will bury her husband on Wednesday, 11 days after motorcycle-riding men shot him dead at Pasay Rotunda on Edsa and Taft Avenue.

Siaron made money by driving a pedicab—a bicycle with a sidecar—and did odd jobs.
He voted for Mr. Duterte in the May 9 presidential election, Olayres said in an interview with the Inquirer on Sunday. 
Olayres, 26,  is not a registered voter, but she said she, too, would have voted for Mr. Duterte “because we wanted an end to crime.”
Six weeks after Siaron cast his vote for the candidate who promised to wipe out the illegal drug trade, he became part of the statistics, falling along with five other men gunned down by suspected vigilantes in Pasay and Manila early on July 23.
The night before he was gunned down, Siaron had dinner at his father’s  fruit stall at the rotunda and bought a P30-“lumpiang shanghai” meal for his wife. Then he returned to his job, never to come home again.
From their shack built on a trash-clogged creek in Barangay Santo Niño in the rundown part of Pasay City, Olayres ran barefoot to Taft Avenue when a friend called out that Siaron had been shot.
 ‘Nobody helped him’

Recalling the moment she found her husband’s body, she said she thought he was just hit by a stray bullet and could still be alive. But he was dead.
“When I was cradling him, I was thinking, ‘How long have you been lying here?’ Nobody bothered to help him. I was furious,” Olayres said, speaking at the Santo Niño barangay hall under the elevated tracks of the LRT where the body of her husband lay in a white coffin.
“Thoughts were running in my mind. ‘It can’t be you. You don’t deserve this. There are others who deserve this more than you,’” she said in a separate interview with Reuters.
“If only I had wings, I would quickly fly to his side,” she said.
Photographers surrounded her behind a police cordon as she cuddled her husband’s body. A piece of cardboard was left next to his body with the words “drug pusher” written on it.
Inquirer photo
The next day, the Inquirer published a front-page photo of a weeping Olayres cradling the body of Siaron, a heartbreaking image that went viral on the internet, sounding a global alarm over human rights violations in the Philippines.
But that picture failed to touch Mr. Duterte. He mentioned it in his inaugural State of the Nation Address to Congress on July 25, calling it melodramatic and seeking to evoke “Pieta,” the 1499 sculpture of Michelangelo depicting a heart-rending scene from the Deposition of Jesus.
“You are portrayed in a broadsheet like [the Virgin] Mary cradling the [body] of Jesus Christ. Let’s do drama here,” Mr. Duterte said in his speech in response to the public outrage inspired by the photo.
Church groups, rights advocates and some sections of the media have criticized Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs and expressed alarm at what they have termed extrajudicial killings.


More than 500 people, mostly poor drug users, have been killed since Mr. Duterte was elected.
As of July 30, the statistics stood at 525 killed: 170 in vigilante attacks and 355 during police operations.
‘No mercy’
In his maiden policy speech, Mr. Duterte declared there would be no letup in the campaign, ordering police and local officials to “double your efforts, triple them if need be.”
“We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars or below the ground if they so wish,” he said.
He vowed to show “no mercy,” warning criminals that priests and human rights advocates cannot protect them from death.
“If you don’t want to die, if you don’t want to get hurt, don’t rely on priests and human rights [advocates]. That won’t stop death,” he said.
Such words from the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City draw cheers from his supporters, hurting Olayres, who lamented that some people were unperturbed by the killings.
 ‘Difficult to accept’ 
“They’re happy because it hasn’t happened to them. What if they lose a loved one, someone who is not guilty of the offense?” Olayres said in the interview with the Inquirer. “It’s difficult to accept.”


“President Duterte hates pushers. I hope he himself will investigate the killings of people who have been judged with a cardboard,” she said, referring to the cardboard signs that read “drug pusher” left by the killers beside the bodies of their victims.
In the war on drugs, “they should go to the root,” she said, adding that her blood boiled after she saw the Inquirer photo in a blog that branded it as fake.
“I hope they think first before they judge. That kind of situation when you see someone you love slumped on the road, are you going to think of drama?” she said.
“I am not expecting justice for my husband. I know we won’t get that, especially since people believe the cardboards—cardboards that can never prove if the slain person is really a pusher. I just want to clear my husband’s name,” she said. Reports from the wires and Erika Sauler

The Supreme Court last year ruled in favor of the Diocese of Bacolod that caught the ire of the Commission on Elections when it posted the tarpaulins.
The  Diocese of Bacolod would be standing up for the sacredness of human life, amid the mounting killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, Pasquin said. 
“We are in favor of the campaign against drugs, but are taking a strong stand against the rampant extrajudicial killings of drug suspects,” Pasquin said.
The Catholic Church has also been opposing the restoration of the death penalty based on moral principles and God’s commandment, he said, adding that “life is sacred and precious because it comes from God.”
He said priests in the Diocese of Bacolod have taken to the pulpit to express alarm over the rise in killings and the need to value life in consonance with the sixth commandment – “Thou shalt not kill.”
The “Thou shalt not kill” tarpaulin will be put up to catechize the people because killing is forbidden by God, according to Pasquin.
“While law enforcers’ killing in self defense is legitimate and accepted in the moral theology of the Church, how do we determine if the claim of self-defense is true?,” he said.

Pasquin said they received reports of vigilantism, and that those in the drug trade were killing their own people before they were exposed.
“Killing comes from the mouth of the President. Every time he speaks he says ‘I will kill you’ that has become part of our culture,” Pasquin said.
He stressed that the offender should be given a chance to reform and convert.
But once the offender was killed, he added, that would be the end of it.  SFM

The Supreme Court last year ruled in favor of the Diocese of Bacolod that caught the ire of the Commission on Elections for posting the tarpaulins.
This time, the Diocese of Bacolod is again standing up for the sacredness of human life, amid the mounting killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war against crimes, according to Pasquin. 
The messages of the tarpaulins are as follows: “Thou shalt not kill…drugs kill…crimes kill…corruption and poverty kill…abortion is killing…summary execution is killing. Life is sacred.”
Pasquin said the tarpaulins did not single out any person or group for censure, but condemned all forms of killing against the teachings of Christ.
“We are in favor of the campaign against drugs, but are taking a strong stand against the rampant extrajudicial killings of drug suspects,” Pasquin said.
The Church would also oppose the restoration of the death penalty based on moral principles and God’s commandment, he said, adding that “life is sacred and precious because it comes from God.”
He said priests in the Diocese of Bacolod have taken to the pulpit to express alarm over the rising number of killings and the need to value life in consonance with the sixth commandment – “Thou shalt not kill.”

The “Thou shalt not kill” tarpaulins are meant to catechize the people on the sin of killing as forbidden by God, according to Pasquin.
“While law enforcers’ killing in self defense is legitimate and accepted in the moral theology of the Church, how do we determine if the claim of self defense is true?” he said.
Pasquin said they received reports of vigilantism, and drug trade leaders killing their own people to prevent them from surrendering to the police and confessing amid the government’s intensified war on drugs.
“Killing comes from the mouth of the President. Every time he speaks he says ‘I will kill you,’ that has become part of our culture,” Pasquin said.
He stressed that the offender should be given a chance to reform and convert.
But no reform and conversion could happen in the killing spree apparently being encouraged by government, said Pasquin.
Pasquin said the Catholic church would help government in the rehabilitation of surrendered drug users, especially in the aspect of spiritual formation.
He said parishes in the Diocese of Bacolod would hold a regular recollection to raise funds for the rehabilitation of drug suspects.
Spiritual formation is the most important aspect of rehabilitation, according to Paquin.  SFM

The NBI’s “human sketch” on the other hand showed that Dela Riarte sustained four gunshot wounds.
Dela Riarte was arrested last July 29 after he figured in a road altercation with another motorist, Eric Fajardo. He was handcuffed and supposed to be brought to Camp Crame but was shot along the way. 
On the other hand, based on the forensic report by PAO’s Forensic Laboratory conducted by Dr. Erwin P. Erfe, Dela Riarte sustained five entry wounds and two exit wounds.
Four of the entry wounds are in the chest, pelvic and front upper thigh while one was at the back of the right thigh.
“Isa po ay contact gunshot wound. Nakadikit sa dibdib nya nung binaril sya,” Dr. Erfe said at a press conference.
He added that based on the size of the wounds, it would appear that a .45 caliber was used when he was shot in the front while a .9mm was used to shoot him at the back of his right thigh.
“Entry wound is 15-25 degree angle. Acute yung angle maaaring nakadapa siya nung binaril siya sa likuran,” Erfe said.

He added that there were also handcuff marks on the victim and abrasions on his right pelvic area and buttocks.
Dela Riarte’s brother, Robert, already filed before the Department of Justice (DOJ) a complaint against De Villa and Manon-og. The two policemen are facing complaints for murder, robbery, violations of Republic Act 9475 or the Anti-Torture Law and RA 7438 or the Act defining certain rights of person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation.
Dela Riarte’s relatives said the P30,000 that the victim had inside his body bag was also missing.

A chairperson of the House appropriations committee, Nograles said the thousands of drug users surrendering to authorities, as well as Duterte’s issuance of a freedom of information (FOI) executive order covering the executive department, were indications that change has come as the President had promised in his presidential campaign.
“I think the first 50 days of the new President has been very productive and an excellent beginning to his presidency,” Nograles said. 
Nograles, however, failed to mention the hundreds of summary killings of drug suspects, some of whom were hogtied and slung with a cardboard signs saying “I am a pusher” and dumped in the streets of the metropolis since Duterte waged the war on drugs.
For his part, Zamboanga City Rep. Celso Lobregat described Duterte’s first 50 days in three words – “shock and awe.”
“Change is here and the President is serious in what he’s doing. And the effect is really shocking to those who are sort of guilty, and awe to those who wanted change,” Lobregat said.
PBA Rep. Mark Sambar said Duterte’s first 50 days provided proof that his promise of change is possible.
“For the first 50 days, our President has delivered on his promise of change. it’s very apparent naman. We have a lot of campaign promises that he made during the campaign period, one by one he’s starting to deliver…,” Sambar said.

Sambar said with the support of Congress, “(Duterte’s) dream of having a very clean, corrupt- and crime-free Philippines is really possible.”
“Nakikita ng tao na pwede pala. I think the 50 days is a good example of that,” Sambar said.
Quezon City Rep. Alfred Vargas, a member of the erstwhile ruling Liberal Party, said he was impressed that in his own district alone, at least a thousand drug users have surrendered to police in the first 50 days of Duterte’s administration.
“For me, as an LP who’s a member of the majority, so far so good ang performance ng President dito. Particularly sa peace and order. More than 1,000 in my district sumuko voluntarily. Before hirap na hirap ang [mga pulis na] hulihin. In 50 days, more than 1,000 na sumuko. I think that’s a good sign,” Vargas said.
Iloilo Rep. Oscar Garin said Duterte exceeded his expectations for accomplishing a lot in 50 days as opposed to his promise of making an impact in the first six months of his administration.
“It was beyond our expectation that the President did it so fast instead of waiting for six months. Just 50 days, he did it so fast,” Garin said./rga

He had two gunshot wounds in the head and two in the back.
A bystander was grazed by one of the six bullets fired by the gunmen. 
A witness who asked not to be identified, said that shortly after the attack, they saw four masked men on two motorcycles holding orange bags fleeing from the crime scene.
The four masked men told witnesses to give way as they sped away on their motorcycles.
Barangay officials said there was no policeman in the area at that time, and a fireworks display was ongoing in line with the Nazarene procession when Milvar was killed. “It might have been planned,” they said.
According to West Crame Village councilor Buboy Nonato, Milvar and his wife Tess were on the police’s drug watch list.
Only Milvar, however, was forced to surrender after the fourth “knock” on his door by members of the Eastern Police District last Wednesday, Nonato said.

Tess, who was also a suspected pusher, reportedly left their home after her husband was killed.
There were reports of drug dens around the Philippine National Police Camp Crame.
“Matagal na po iyon. Pero meron pa rin po (Those have long been there.  They have stayed on),” a barangay officer who requested anonymity, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
Since July, around 95 drug suspects in Barangay West Crame have surrendered to the police.
Oplan Tokhang is the PNP campaign wherein policemen go to the homes of known drug pushers and users in the community to persuade them to surrender and undergo drug rehabilitation.
An investigation is ongoing. SFM

DAGUPAN CITY―Maximo Garcia, 53, surrendered to the police on Saturday after he was told that he was on a drug watch list.
Three days later, a man approached his house at Barangay Mayombo at 12:30 p.m. and opened fire on Garcia as he and his family were having lunch.

Garcia fled to the back of the house but was shot and wounded by the gunman. His 5-year-old granddaughter, Danica May, was hit in the head and later died in hospital, the youngest fatality and latest collateral damage in President Duterte’s war on illegal drugs.

He had been helping his wife Gemma operate a small eatery in front of their house provided by the Department of Social Welfare and Development in the flood-prone barangay.
The wife said earnings went to food, Garcia’s medicines and caring for Danica, whose 29-year-old mother has separated from her husband. 
But life had been good for Danica, Gemma said.
Danica had always been excited about attending kindergarten at East Central Elementary School here, the woman said. The child would take a bath early, eat her lunch and head for school.
“This is so painful to us,” she said. “I would miss the nights when Danica would massage us until we fell asleep. I would miss her laughter when she teased her mother.”
Gemma said she was surprised to learn that her husband was on the police drug watch list. He was later persuaded by the barangay captain to surrender to clear his name and also for his own safety.
She said she could not understand why anyone would attack her husband, who she said had never been involved in illegal drugs.

“We are afraid to stay here. But the problem is where will we go? The killers may come back for my husband,” she said.
Supt. Neil Miro, Dagupan police chief, theorized that drug dealers were behind the attack.
As of Tuesday, 26 suspected drug dealers had been killed in the city, four of them in a clash with police, Miro said.
Bulacan beheading
In Bulacan province on Monday night, a 14-year-old boy was beheaded allegedly by his drug-crazed uncle in the City of San Jose del Monte.
The boy’s body bore multiple stab wounds when it was found by his family members on a dump in Barangay Minuyan Proper at 10 p.m., hours after witnesses saw him fleeing from his uncle, who was wielding a knife, said Supt. Wilson Magpali, San Jose del Monte police chief.
On Tuesday, the police arrested the attacker, who led them to a place near a river where the boy’s head was buried. The suspect was incoherent when policemen detained him.
Also on Tuesday at Barangay San Jose in Quezon City, three drug suspects were killed in an encounter with police during a “buy-bust operation” at 2:35 a.m.
Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, city police chief, identified one of the fatalities as Rodolfo Hallare, 48. The two other slain suspects remain unidentified but policemen estimated them to be between 20 and 30 years old.
Operatives said one of their colleagues posed as a buyer of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) and bought from Hallare and his group. Hallare was about to receive payment when his partners shouted they were around, triggering a gunfight.


Recovered from the scene were two .45-cal. pistols, one
.38-cal. revolver, three plastic sachets of shabu and P1,490 cash.
As of Wednesday, 56 drug suspects have been killed in police operations in Quezon City since July 1.
Eleazar, however, said that more than 700 drug suspects did not resist arrest. With reports from Carmela Reyes-Estrope, Inquirer Central Luzon; and Maricar Brizuela in Quezon City

DAGUPAN CITY, Pangasinan –Senator Leila de Lima visited on Sunday (Aug. 28), the wake of the five-year-old girl killed last week by a gunman who was allegedly out to kill the child’s grandfather.
De Lima arrived at the home of slain kindergarten pupil Danica Mae Garcia at 5 p.m. and stayed for about 10 minutes, said Danica’s grandmother Gemma Garcia.

Garcia said De Lima refused to have her photograph taken with the family members and neighbors, and did not grant an interview request from a local TV reporter.
De Lima was escorted to the area by police officers manning the community precinct in Mayombo, the village where the Garcias reside. 
Garcia’s husband Maximo, the target of the gunman, was shot and wounded and was still being treated for a stomach injury, as of Sunday.
Four days before the attack, he surrendered to the police in order to clear his name, after being told that he was on a police drug watch list.
The police identified Bryan Macaayao as the gunman, and have filed murder and frustrated murder cases against him. The same charges were also filed against an unidentified accomplice who drove the motorcycle they used to flee the crime scene.
Senator Leila de Lima has been heading a Senate inquiry into the spate of drug-related killings that have gripped the nation since President Duterte ordered his policemen to wage a war against illegal drugs.  De Lima suspects that rogue cops involved in illegal drugs have been summarily executing drug pushing suspects who could turn witness against them.
President Duterte, thinking De Lima has unfairly tainted the entire Philippine National Police’s campaign against illegal drugs, has alleged that De Lima accepted drug protection money when she was Department of Justice secretary and had jurisdiction over the New Bilibid Prison, where criminals were believed to be directing drug trafficking operations. SFM

ILOILO CITY — The families of the slain suspected drug lord, Melvin Odicta,  and wife Meriam Odicta, will not file any case amid lingering questions on how the couple were killed and who ordered it.
“We are not interested in filing any cases or to press for an investigation. We want peace for the sake of their children and love ones left behind,” Barangay Tanza-Esperanza Chairman Noel Odicta, Melvin’s younger brother, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer, at the Odicta residence on Wednesday.

The village official also appealed to President Duterte and Philippine National Police Director General Ronald Dela Rosa:  “Mr. President and General Bato. We have accepted what had happened to them. We are innocent and we are not involved in whatever they have been accused of. The past is past. If they have done wrong, we apologize. They are already dead,” Noel said.

The couple had denied these allegations and had insisted that they were operators and owners of legitimate businesses.
They went to Manila and met with Interior Secretary Ismael “Mike” Sueno on Aug. 25, to clear their names and to seek security assistance amid concerns of a rubout. 
The next day, on Aug. 26, Dela Rosa dismissed Odicta’s denial and confirmed that the Iloilo businessman was the top drug lord in the region.
The couple were shot dead by an unidentified assailant early on Aug. 29 after they got off the roll-on, roll-off vessel MV St. Anthony De Padua at the Caticlan port in Malay, Aklan.  SFM

The Philippine National Police (PNP) has filed 628 criminal cases before the courts in connection with a spate of “mysterious” deaths or so-called summary killings since President Rodrigo Duterte waged his war on drugs.
During the appropriations committee hearing on the Department of Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) proposed P148.73-billion budget in 2017, PNP Director General Ronald “Bato” de la Rosa was asked by Kabayan Rep. Harry Roque about the latest death toll of drug suspects.

Dela Rosa said the police had filed charges over so-called “mysterious deaths” or “deaths under investigation,” or the killings that occurred outside legitimate police antidrug operations.
Del Rosa said of the 1,507 reported deaths, the police had filed 628 cases in court. 
He cited the killings of father and son Renato and Jaybee Bertes, who was arrested by the Pasay City police for drug possession. After the two allegedly tried to grab the police officer’s gun, they were shot inside the police station. The police officers face murder charges in connection with the incident.

“Wala kaming pinapabayaang death. Everytime, iniimbestigahan namin. We are constantly asking for update … Kaya nagkaroon ng 628 filed cases because of consistent follow up,” De la Rosa said.
“That seems to be very good. That would indicate that the PNP is discharging its functions to investigate and after the Department of Justice will prosecute and later the court will convict these killings,” Roque said.
Roque maintained that all deaths, whether outside or during legitimate police operations, should be investigated by the police.

“Lahat ng deaths should be considered as deaths. In my mind, we should be investigating these deaths, regardless of mysterious deaths or in relation to ongoing war against drugs,” Roque said.
De la Rosa also said there was a discrepancy between the death toll of media outlets and that of the police because the reckoning period for the media was as early as May or immediately after Duterte won the elections, while the police started tallying upon the President’s assumption of office on June 30./rga

In July, Anita and 179 others showed up at the police station in the village of Subangdaku in Mandaue City as part of “Oplan Tokhang,” a police campaign to persuade users and pushers to cease their involvement in drugs.
A month later, she went to the pastoral center of San Roque Parish in Subangdaku and joined 90 others who were told about the barangay-based recovery and reintegration program. 
No shortcuts
Ugnayan ng mga Barangay at Simbahan (Ubas) launched the pilot long-term program for drug dependents last Aug. 28. “In the fight against illegal drugs, there can be no shortcuts,” said Fr. Carmelo Diola, the lead convener.
Diola stressed that the Catholic Church and other sectors of society should not just watch as addicts waste away. “If we don’t reach out to them, their co-drug addicts will,” he said. “The opposite of addiction is connection.”
In Central Visayas, at least 71,000 pushers and users have “surrendered” to the police in Cebu, Siquijor and Bohol provinces since July. They are too many for the 45 rehabilitation centers in the country, six of which are in Cebu.
The centers can accommodate  only up to 5,000, so the Church decided to create the community-based program to rehabilitate users.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Chief Supt. Noli Taliño, police director for Central Visayas, promised to support the Ubas program. He directed all city and provincial police directors and station police chiefs to help the group. “I will create a team to assist the Church in this endeavor,” he said.
Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma said the Church must provide a haven for drug addicts, stressing that they are not outcasts.
“Many lives have been destroyed by illegal drugs. But we should not despair,” Palma said. “There’s hope. I’m happy that people come together to find solutions to this problem.”
Ubas’ program consists of four stages: admission of addicts into the program, psychosocial intervention, capacity building and reintegration into society.
At the start, Diola said, the kind of help addicts need should be determined. Those who need extensive treatment must be brought to the rehabilitation centers, but those who do not will be offered free counseling and spiritual transformation in the community-based facilities.
Volunteers and psychiatrists from Magone Home of the Salesians of Don Bosco are helping out in the program, which started in Subangdaku where village officials, led by Ernie Manatad, and the local police are very cooperative.
But Ubas and the regional police force want to replicate the program elsewhere. “We need to transition from Tokhang to Labang (Lahat Bangon),” Diola said. “There can be no fence sitters in the campaign.”
The priest is no stranger to the evils of drugs. He and the Church-based Dilaab Foundation Inc. had actively campaigned against “narcopolitics” since the early 2000s.
He said the proliferation of drugs, though, was a result of the failure of the justice system, as well as the community’s apathy. “In a larger sense, illegal drugs have become a dominant reality due to the failure of all sectors to come together,” he said.
“Back then, it was a  very lonely fight. Now, the picture has completely changed. Those in illegal drugs are on the defensive,” he added.


‘Mother of all crimes’
Diola said he appreciated President Duterte’s campaign to rid the country of drugs and drug trafficking, which the priest branded as the “mother of all crimes.”
“Our society has just grown so used to the prevalence of drugs that we no longer pay attention to the countless rapes, murders and thievery brought by illegal drugs,” he said.
“Societies are teetering toward perdition as families slowly disintegrate in the face of the drug menace,” he said.
Diola said the failure of previous administrations to address the drug scourge had made it “spin out of control.”
While eradicating illegal drugs is badly needed, sustainable solutions must also be found, he said. He, however, cautioned against shortcuts in solving the problem, alluding to the summary executions of drug suspects.
From July 1 to Aug. 25, 73 suspected drug pushers were killed in police operations in Central Visayas, and 97, by unidentified assailants.
Aside from its community-based rehabilitation program, Diola said the Church also wanted to make people aware of the evils of drugs and to gradually remove the social stigma attached to addiction.
Public health issue
Addiction is primarily a public health issue, Diola said. He urged the government to stop treating drugs as mainly a law enforcement problem.


“This requires building more rehabilitation centers and adequately training and building the capability of its health workers to deal with drug addicts,” Diola said.
The business sector must also be willing to provide training and job opportunities for recovering addicts, he said.
Diola said the Roman Catholic Church and other denominations must do their share in addressing the problem.
“The spiritual dimension is essential. We need to realize that drug abuse is but a manifestation of human hearts remaining restless unless they rest in God,” he said.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/22887/assault-on-sheriff-is-abuse-of-power-by-dutertes,Assault on sheriff is abuse of power by Dutertes,"03:07 AM July 11, 2011","The public outrage over the attack by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte on a sheriff serving a court’s demolition order has blown up into a national issue involving abuse of power of  elected local officials claiming autonomy from the central government.
What started as an attack on an officer of the court performing a judicial duty escalated into a full-blown controversy after Sheriff Abe Andres did the incredible thing of apologizing to the mayor, who had beaten him up after he refused her request to stay for two hours the demolition of squatter shanties in Agdao District.

The Dutertes made it appear they were the offended party, not the sheriff. 
It is not uncommon in the law of the jungle of the Philippine judicial system and in the relationship between powerful officials and weak bureaucrats that the latter end up the “lawbreakers,” as the more powerful enjoy impunity from prosecution and accountability. 
The Dutertes took refuge behind a false populist argument that the mayor had intervened to stop a demolition notice issued by a judge on the claim that she wanted to avert a riot by angry squatters. They claimed the sheriff was unreasonable in not granting a two-hour stay of execution. 
Sara Duterte further claimed she had rushed to the scene to stop the demolition after distributing relief goods to flood victims, as part of her duties to her constituents and as a manifestation of her compassion for the victims of calamities.
That is cheap populist posturing.
On the offensive
The Dutertes have now gone on an offensive to justify their violent actions and mobilize public opinion in their constituency in Davao.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


The PR campaign seeks to turn the issue into a referendum approving their actions before criminal action is started by the national authorities.  
Whether these claims are valid excuses or whether the sheriff’s manner of executing the demolition order justified Sara Duterte’s flare-up, it is an inescapable fact that she faces possible criminal and administrative action for assaulting an officer of the court.
Being a public official, she cannot escape accountability for acts of violence related to the discharge of her official duties—acts she can be proceeded against by either her victim, by the Department of Justice, Department of the Interior and Local Government or Supreme Court for contempt of court.
She also risks disciplinary action by the Judicial and Bar Council, of which she is a member as a lawyer.
It’s up to these institutions to take action to teach her and her political clan a lesson that abuse of power is intolerable in a society that proclaims its adherence to the rule of law and eschews the violent impulses of officials whose egos are bruised by people who refuse to obey their demands.
Ampatuan warlords
Sara Duterte is on leave and her father, Rodrigo Duterte, acts in her absence and has ably taken up the cudgels on her behalf. He claims it was only proper for the sheriff to apologize, saying the demolition was “illegal, the sheriff was not supposed to be there.”
The elder Duterte said that under Republic Act No. 7279, local governments are required to give a 30-day notice for evictions. Assuming this to be correct, it should be asked, who gave the mayor the right and the power to summarily punish other officials for acts involving discharge of their duties.
To understand where the Dutertes are coming from, it is important to know that they belong to a class of local officials who believe they have local autonomy powers that put them above the national law. They rule their provincial jurisdictions with their own set laws, which make them unaccountable to the law of the land. 
The Ampatuan warlords of Maguindanao belong to this category. They operate under the state of mind that their local autonomy has given them the impunity to abuse their power. 


Dangerous doctrine
The Dutertes are now making a case for this dangerous doctrine in their populist campaign for an informal referendum in Davao.
Barangay captains of Davao City have published a manifesto of support for Sara Duterte. It says the governance of the elected leaders of Davao has been “put to a test.” It adds that the people of Davao have chosen a leader who has been “defending the safety and welfare of the poor and vulnerable.” 
This manifesto takes off from the creed of rule practiced by Rodrigo Duterte when he was mayor. Under his leadership, the city claims to have experienced relative peace and stability. Its crime rate dropped dramatically, prompting tourist organizations to boast that Davao “is the most peaceful city in Southeast Asia.” 
He was, however, criticized by human rights groups for supposedly tolerating extrajudicial killings of criminals allegedly by Davao death squads. He denied direct involvement in those killings.
A human rights website, midfield.wordpress.com., reports a statement attributed to Duterte in February 2009:  “If you are doing an illegal activity in my city, if you are a criminal or part of a syndicate that preys on the innocent people of the city, for as long as I am the mayor, you are a legitimate target of assassination.”
Abuse of power
Human rights organizations report that Duterte and other local officials have continued to deny the existence of any death squads. But in recent years, mayors and officials of other cities “have made statements justifying similar killings in their own cities.” 
Davao City “is seen by some as a model for fighting crime,” according to the report. Human Rights Watch, based in New York, believed such killings had continued and perpetrators enjoyed “impunity largely because of the tolerance of, and in some cases, outright support from local authorities.”
It is not far-fetched to argue that the violent actions of Mayor Sara Duterte take a leaf from the culture of impunity engendered by the model set by ex-Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.
