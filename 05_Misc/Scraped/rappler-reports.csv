https://rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/new-case-extrajudicial-killing-marikina,"Victim plays dead: In Marikina, a new case of ‘extrajudicial killing’",,"MANILA, Philippines – The basketball court was crowded in the evening, a blue tent shielding the starless sky. The grieving and their children sat upright on plastic monobloc chairs as they listened to the female pastor preach about justice and God with a cracking subwoofer. Behind her lay a man they knew dearly.
Kim Lester Ramos, 23, loved playing basketball. He was short and thin, but the players who knew him said his feet moved with certainty. He spoke little but laughed often. He did not smoke. Only drank on birthdays and holidays. He was still more of a boy than a man. They all said he was kind.
That night, he rested inside the walls of a chalk-white casket, just under the shadow of a rusting ring where he dropped his three-pointers.
His face, calm, bulged below his right eyebrow. On October 5, a cop shot him within point-blank range from behind his head. Police said Kim tried to snatch a cornered cop’s gun. The cop won in the supposed tussle and shot Kim straight in the head.
The people of Mountain View Subdivision in Marikina City know a different story. They say they were the lucky ones in the government’s war, as not one of their men had been lost in a TokHang visit or buy-bust after thousands have been slain.
Confronted with their first case, they could not sleep. They said they could not stay silent either. On the rotting railings of the court hung a spread of black cloth painted red and orange that said “JUSTICE FOR KIM.” Posted a few steps away was a tarpaulin screaming the same, but with a label for Kim: “EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLING VICTIM.”
They were familiar with the stories of those killed in other neighborhoods. They were ready to fight back.
The witness and victim speaks out: ‘Pumikit na lang ako’
Lauro Lagarde, 22, told his story on a reclined white single bed inside a buzzing male ward of the Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center.
He remembered seeing darkness even before the sun set on October 5, the day he almost died. Lauro shut his eyes as he bled after being shot and falling from his motorcycle. He held his breath and lay still, pretending to be dead as Kim ran away.
The cop aimed his gun at Lauro’s chest, but Lauro shoved down the gun as the cop pulled the trigger. The bullet entered his left hip and came out of the left cheek of his buttocks.
He then heard the cop run after Kim, with seconds of slapping flipflops on the pavement before the gunshot. He peeked, just for a second, and saw his friend fall, face down on the pavement.
“Narinig ko na hinabol niya si Kim. Noong naramdaman kong hinabol niya si Kim, tiningnan ko kung ano ang gagawin niya. Binaril niya talaga,” Lauro said. (I heard him run after Kim. When I sensed that he was chasing Kim, I looked at what he would do next. He really shot him.)
Lauro forced his eyes shut once more. He choked back tears and screams.
Just an hour earlier, he was shooting hoops with Kim and another friend, Johnny. Lauro had just finished repolishing his motorcycle, a pink Mio, while Kim came from work at the Project 4 district in Quezon City. The court was their refuge.
They wanted to have supper at a nearby eatery but first decided to meet in front of Johnny’s house nearby. They sat by the gutter as they waited, Lauro teasing Kim for playing Mobile Legends, when a cop whizzed past them aboard a motorcycle then made a U-turn. The cop spoke with a man on the street they did not know, then looked to Kim and Lauro.
“Kayong mga adik magsitigil-tigil na kayo sa paggamit ng droga (You addicts, stop using illegal drugs already),” Lauro recalled the cop saying. Then the cop sped off, leaving the boys shocked.
As they rode the motor to supper, by coincidence, they caught up with the cop at the intersection of Mount Vernon Street and Gil Fernando Avenue. Lauro confronted the cop.
“Sir, bakit ‘nyo kami sinasabihan na adik (Sir, why are you calling us addicts)?” Lauro recalled asking the cop. That was when the cop pulled his gun and shot them.
Lauro kept his eyes shut until he heard the footsteps of people – witnesses. With all his strength, Lauro pulled out his phone from his right pocket to try and call his friends and to get an ambulance. The cop snatched his phone, spat at him with expletives, and said, “Pasalamat ka buhay ka pa (Be thankful you’re alive).”
The crowd then began taking photos of him and Kim, angering the cop. The cop pushed the people away, and while holding on to his pistol, ordered them to delete all the footage they took.
“Sabi niya, ‘Pulis ako, pulis ako,’” Lauro recalled. (He said, “I’m a cop, I’m a cop.”)
Lauro never got his phone back.
The rescue attempt: ‘Muntik na’
Christopher Ramos, 33, arrived first from among Kim’s family at the crime scene. He was panting as a curious crowd started to form. Cops marked their territory with the yellow line.
Inside the no-cross zone, Christopher saw Lauro groaning as he bled, and around 10 meters away, saw his cousin Kim lying, face down, his left hand holding a blue handkerchief, his right hand empty.
At around 6:45 pm, Christopher said there were around a dozen cops at the crime scene, 3 of them standing guard around his cousin. He began to panic as there was no ambulance in sight. The cops were just looking, he said.
Then Christopher saw Kim’s head twitch – a sign of life – and he quickly slipped past the police line and dashed towards the body. His calculation was simple: he would haul his cousin’s body to the Amang Rodriguez Medical Center, 10 minutes away, to save him, instead of waiting another minute for an ambulance.
“Mahahawakan ko na sana. Muntik na. Kung nahawakan ko ‘yun itatakbo ko talaga ‘yun eh (I almost touched him. I almost did it. If I had grasped him, I would have run and carried him away),” Christopher said, as he began to cry.
Before he could reach Kim, a policeman pushed him out. Christopher said he was Kim’s cousin. The cops didn’t appear to care. Even Kim’s father was kept out of the yellow line.
Christopher cried for cops to call an ambulance. Again, they just looked. Helpless, Christopher joined the rest who were staring at his cousin, praying that he would move again.
Kim had long stopped twitching when a funeral van picked him up from the scene.
The making of a coverup? ‘Pinabalik-balik kami’
When the van took off from the crime scene, Norman Ramos, 63, was already down the corner, standing to block its path. The only way he would leave, he said, was if he was let into the van. The funeraria men gave him the shotgun seat.
At the funeral parlor, Norman saw his son up close. Kim wore a white shirt and bright silver basketball shorts. His right eye was a red void, while his forehead and knees still bled from the fall on the asphalt.
Norman wanted to know what led to his boy’s killing. That same night, he went to the barangay hall, but was told that policemen kept the blotter. He went to the Marikina City Police Station, but was told to return in the morning. When he returned in the morning, he was told to come back after lunch. When he returned after lunch, he was asked to drop by again in an hour.
“Pinapabalik-balik lang ako (They only kept asking me to go back),” Norman said. He never got a police report.
Meanwhile, Lauro’s family was told about what happened only the next day. Lauro’s younger sister, Leslie, said she was also repeatedly asked by cops to return. They only found out about her brother’s case when a prosecutor and lawyer dropped by the hospital to hold bedridden Lauro for an inquest.
“Pinapabalik kami, 'yun pala, ginagawa na nila (They were asking us to return when in fact they were already working on it),” said Ansly Lagarde, Lauro’s eldest sister.
For Ansly and Leslie, ""working"" on the case meant the cops were working on a false narrative to spin the case against Kim and Lauro.
Even the media was informed late about the details of the encounter. In a news report dated October 7, the Journal reported that police announced the details in a “belated report.” (READ: Marikina cop shoots laborer in the head in alleged scuffle)
Other reporters have tried to speak with Lauro Lagarde inside the hospital, but he and his family said guards have been blocking reporters from entering, with or without cameras. 
Police accounts don’t add up: ‘Napilitan akong putukan’
In the affidavit of Police Corporal Herjonner Soller, he was the victim on October 5. His story presents an alternate reality to what Kim's and Lauro’s families have seen. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Soller is an intelligence officer. At 6:30 pm, he said he was on “surveillance operation” in civilian attire to keep track of their most wanted persons when he found 4 men whom he described as “kahina-hinalang nakatambay sa madilim na bahagi ng kalsada (suspiciously loitering at a dark part of the street).”
Soller said he introduced himself as a cop and asked them what they were doing, but the men supposedly said, “Pakialam mo (why do you care)?” and when he left, he claimed the men shouted without any prompting, “Hoy gago, p*tangina mo, gago ka (Hey bastard, you son of a bitch, you’re a bastard)!”
Soller said two of the men, Lauro and Kim, then followed him onboard their own motorcycle.
Without explaining how, he said that they all fell from their bikes when they reached the intersection of Mount Vernon Street and Gil Fernando Avenue. Soller then said Lauro snatched his “bag” which contained his pistol, ammo magazine, handcuffs, money, and his ID.
While pulling it, Soller was supposedly able to open his bag and take out his pistol. Soller then said that Lauro tried to grab his gun and hold it by the barrel. According to Soller, they fought for the gun until eventually the gun’s trigger was pulled, releasing a bullet into Lauro’s hip.
The cop did not account for what Kim was doing while the scuffle was happening.
In Soller’s story, Kim had a gun with him all along, but Kim apparently decided to run towards a tree after Lauro was shot. Soller said Kim pointed the pistol at him, forcing him to shoot. Even at a supposedly far range, Soller was able to shoot Kim’s head even as Kim supposedly turned his back on Soller.
Soller claimed he immediately called for his teammates to call an ambulance, contrary to what witnesses saw in the crime scene.
Soller’s affidavit also does not match the narrative presented to the media by Marikina police chief Colonel Restituto Arcanghel. The more senior cop told the Journal that Soller identified Ramos as being involved in robbery cases. Arcanghel also said Kim was part of the gun scuffle, which was not in Soller’s account.
A community takes a stand: ‘Hindi kami natatakot’
On the other side of the blue tent are metal bleachers packed with young-looking adults, Kim and Lauro’s church community, the Christian Walk Ministry, ready to fight for them.
The Christian Walk Ministry is a born-again Christian organization that leads weekly bible teachings and feeding programs for the poor. As expected, Kim and Lauro were among the top organizers of the community liga (basketball tournament), where even policemen joined.
“Hindi kami natatakot, kasi alam namin nasa tama kami (We are not afraid because we know that we are on the right side),” said Mary Jean Fulgar, one of the group’s most senior members.
Mary Jean watched the two boys grow up in the same court. She knew that they would not lift a pistol against anyone. They did not know how to use a gun. The kid Kim, she said, was even afraid of fireworks, triggering laughter from her companions.
Kim’s father Norman and Lauro’s siblings, meanwhile, have been bracing for battle in the legal arena. Lauro was accused of direct assault and attempted homicide, while Norman wants to clear his son’s name.
They have culled certificates from their barangay and the National Bureau of Investigation saying the two were neither drug personalities nor robbers. They have also spoken with the Commission on Human Rights and Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro to aid them in facing the police.
Kim will be buried on Sunday, October 13. His family and friends will use his funeral procession as a platform to protest killings and demand justice, much like those of drug war slain Caloocan teens Kian delos Santos and Carl Arnaiz, who were killed by cops and then framed as drug suspects.
The Marikina City police have already relieved Soller from his post as an investigation has been opened, but Norman Ramos wants cops to take a step further.
“Gusto kong maipakulong ‘yan, masampahan ng kaso kung anuman ang ginawa niya (I want him to be jailed, to face a case for what he did),” Norman said.
The men and women of Mountain View Subdivision are mourning the death of one of their own. With the pushback, they are making it clear that any cop who commits abuse in their community must pay. – Rappler.com

https://rappler.com/nation/extrajudicial-killing-victim-marikina-burial-community-braces-for-war,"As Marikina ‘EJK’ victim is buried, his community braces for war",," 
MANILA, Philippines – The victim rests, now the community fights back.
Kim Lester Ramos, the “extrajudicial killing” victim in Marikina, was laid to rest on Sunday, October 13. The black hearse carrying him was trailed by scores of people demanding justice for the boy they knew was taken too early and too violently.
Ramos had been shot behind the head by a policeman, identified as Police Corporal Herjonner Soller. According to the cop, Ramos fought to get his gun. As they grappled for the weapon, Soller ended  shooting the young man in the head. Ramos’ friend Lauro Lagarde, however, saw the cop shooting Kim point-blank, with all the intention to kill. (READ: Victim plays dead: In Marikina, a new case of ‘extrajudicial killing’)
Witnesses also saw Kim in the crime scene holding only his handkerchief. But when the police filed a complaint against Lagarde, they attached a grainy black-and-white photo of a hand still lightly squeezing a pistol. They said it was Ramos.
Ramos’ killing came as a shock to a community that has not reckoned with a drug operation killing in their homes. The government has counted at least 5,500 drug suspects killed since the campaign was declared by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 1, 2016. Human rights groups have counted over 20,000 killings from and inspired by the campaign.
Marikina was different, the residents of Mountain View Subdivision believed, until Ramos was killed that Saturday evening. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Father Flavie Villanueva said mass before the weeping crowd at the open court where Ramos’ wake had been—the very court where Ramos grew up playing basketball.
“All of us are shouting justice now. The Lord is also shouting. 'Justice!' One of his commandments is 'Do not kill.' We are with God in shouting 'Do not kill. Stop the killings’,” said Villanueva said in his homily.
Many of them hesitated to go. Just a day before, a police car passed by the wake without any officer speaking with them. While it was their first loss in the so-called drug war, they knew a threat when they saw it.

A boy named Kim
 
Kim Lester Ramos, 23, was a loving son and brother. He worked as a construction worker before he was killed. He dropped a post-high school vocational course so he could work with his parents in paying for the school bills of his 5 siblings.
“Ngayon lang po yang ganyan. Kahit po sa amin wala pong nakikita, ngayon lang po. Ito lang anak ko. Kung sino pa ang mabait doon sa sarili naming bayan, siya pa ang unang biniktima,” said Norman Ramos, Kim’s father.
(This is the first time this happened. We don’t see these cases in our area. It just happened now, with my son as victim. My son who is himself kind to the people of his town, was the first victim.)
He added: “Napakabait po ng anak ko. Matulungin sa amin. Maraming pangarap sa mga kapatid. Paano na niya po yun gagawin? (He was very kind. He was helpful. He had so many dreams for his siblings. How can he fulfil them now?)”
Kim Lester Ramos played basketball with many of the men of the subdivision. The neighbors remembered him for his jokes and his contagious laugh at their church community, the Christian Walk Ministry, where he threw a hand in organizing the last liga (basketball tournament). Among the participants were policemen. (LIST: Minors, college students killed in Duterte's drug war)
On Sunday, the residents of Mountain View donned white shirts printed with Kim's high school graduation photo. He wore a pristine toga and stared straight at the camera. The photo on the shirt is bordered by bold red capital letters: JUSTICE FOR KIM.
‘I am not alone’

The battle would not come easy for the residents of Mountain View. The first, and so far last time, police officers were convicted of murder in a drug operation was in the case of Caloocan teen Kian delos Santos.
Kim Lester Ramos’ family and friends know this. They said they will not stop shouting for justice until the policeman is behind bars. After Kim’s bleach-white coffin was shut by cement in an elevated grave, his family and friends suspended tarpaulins calling for justice.
“Kaya kami lumalaban at suot namin ang t-shirt na ito, dahil naniniwala kami na malinis ang kanyang pagkatao (We are fighting and wearing these shirts because we believe that he is innocent),” said 24-year-old Abegail Garciano, an “Ate"" (big sister) to Kim.
Ramos’ alleged killer, Police Corporal Herjonner Soller, was an intelligence officer before he was placed on floating status over Ramos’ slay. The police have launched an internal investigation, complemented by a probe by the Commission on Human Rights.
Despite the questionable operation, police pursued a complaint against Ramos’ friend, Lauro Lagarde, also accusing him of snatching Soller’s gun and being a notorious robber. Barangay and National Bureau of Investigation clearances obtained by Ramos and Lagarde’s families prove otherwise. Both have no criminal record and have been certified to have been keeping “good conduct” as citizens.
Among the crowd at the funeral is a young man who was teased to look like a smaller version of Kim, complete with the bony frame and big shy eyes. John Martin Ramos, 22, willingly spoke to cameras. He has nothing to hide, he said. John Martin knew his cousin from the basketball court up to their home, where they conquered worlds in Mobile Legends. It was now a real-world battle for a beloved comrade.

https://rappler.com/nation/kian-delos-santos-memorial-caloocan-ejk-victims,"Kian memorial is for all EJK victims, too",,"MANILA, Philippines – The memorial marker for Kian Loyd delos Santos at the San Roque Cathedral, Caloocan City, does not only serve to remember the boy, but also mirrors the current situation in the country. These were the words of Randy delos Santos, uncle of the slain teenager, after the unveiling of Delos Santos' memorial marker on Friday, August 18, at the San Roque Cathedral.""Ang marker na iyan ay pag-aalala sa bata,"" Randy told Rappler in a phone interview. ""Ang marker na iyan ay nagsisilbing salamin sa nangyayari sa ating lipunan, nagsisilbing paalala na mayroong extrajudicial killings (EJKs), at ang batang ito ay namatay dahil sa EJK.""
(That marker serves to remember the kid. That marker serves to mirror what's happening in our society, a reminder that extrajudicial killings exist, and that Kian is a victim.)Apart from Delos Santos' death, the memorial marker notes that he was only one of 81 victims killed within 4 days from August 15-18, 2017, in Metro Manila. It also mentions the thousands who have been killed in the ongoing war on drugs. ""Nawa ang panandang ito ay magsilbing alaala sa mga buhay na pinaslang, mga asawang nabalo, at mga anak na naulila,"" the marker reads.  (May this marker serve as a reminder of the lives of those killed, their widows, and the children they left behind.)
Remembering the victimsAt the Mass after the marker was unveiled, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David also spoke about the thousands of slain victims. ""Woe to you who call addicts 'non-humans' deserving of death. Who gave you the right to pass judgment on people who are sick?"" David said. ""You claim to care about the future of young people in this country. What future awaits them if they end up dead on a street alley after a 'legitimate police operation'?""""Woe to you who claim to be waging a war against illegal drugs but are killing its victims instead of saving them! You who order law enforcers to murder when their mandate is to protect the citizens and defend their right to a safe and secure environment.""
""Woe to you who blindly follow unjust and unlawful orders! You who blindly obey the command to 'kill drug suspects if they resist arrest!' Woe to you who plant evidence in order to justify murder!""

https://rappler.com/nation/sws-survey-filipinos-worry-becoming-ejk-victim,4 out of 5 Filipinos worry over extrajudicial killings – SWS,,"MANILA, Philippines – A Social Weather Stations' (SWS) survey result released on Friday, March 1, said 78% or almost 4 out of 5 Filipinos are worried that they, or someone they know, will be a victim of extrajudicial killings (EJK).
The SWS survey, conducted December 16 to 19, 2018, noted that this number was ""up by 5 points from the 73% (from the survey conducted) in June 2017.""
The June 2017 survey showed 73% of Filipinos worried about EJKs. (READ: 7 in 10 Filipinos worried about selves, neighbors becoming EJK victims – SWS)
In the December 2018 survey, anxiety over EJKs was highest in Visayas (83%), with Metro Manila (79%), Mindanao (78%), and Balance Luzon (75%) following closely.
Despite the worry, though, more people in the December 2018 survey said the government was serious about solving the EJK problem at 71% or 7 out of 10 Filipinos, compared to June 2017 at 63%.
The SWS' December 2018 survey also found that the nation is split on who the EJKs target, with 50% saying only the poor are victimized and 48% saying the problem does not choose a class. Three percent say that only the rich are victimized.
Meanwhile, only 12% of Filipinos say that they know someone who was a victim of EJK. This number went down by 3 percentage points since the June 2017 survey.
Of those who knew a victim, most said that the victim was their acquiantance (8%), while less people said it was their neighbor (3%), relative (2%), best friend (2%), or officemate (2%). More of those who knew a victim came from urban areas (18%) than rural areas (12%).
The SWS survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews with 1,440 adults, aged 18 years and above. They spoke to 360 people each in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
They noted that there is a sampling error margin of ±2.6% for national percentages, and ±5% each for Balance Luzon, Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao.
SWS also noted that their survey was non-commissioned and the results were released as a public service. – Rappler.com"

This is shown by Philippine National Police (PNP) documents obtained by Rappler. In about two years – from July 1, 2016, up to June 11, 2018 – police have recorded 23,518 Homicide Cases Under Investigation (HCUI), equivalent to an average of 33 people killed a day.
HCUIs are murder and homicide cases combined, excluding killings by cops in police operations. Riding-in-tandem killings, being homicides and murders too, are included in this tally.
From July 1, 2016 to May 15, 2018, the government’s counting initiative #RealNumbersPH has tallied 4,279 suspects killed in anti-illegal drug operations, or an average of 6 a day.
The 4,279 are not included in HCUIs as they are presumed to have been carried out by cops in the line of duty.
The killings come as the Duterte administration continues to pursue an unrelenting campaign against drug suspects and criminals, with the President going on record on multiple occasions, encouraging law enforcers and Filipinos to harm and even kill delinquents.
A quick look at PNP data on Duterte’s first year in office shows that the campaign has resulted in a drop in all index crimes (or crimes against persons and property) – but not the killings.
All drug-related?
Not all of the 23,518 homicide cases under investigation fall under the government’s unrelenting anti-illegal drug campaign, the PNP claims.
As the PNP has repeatedly pointed out, the killings were not executed by state forces, but civilians. There are reports, however, accusing cops of going rogue and carrying out the killings themselves, if not supervising them.
The 23,518, according to the PNP, can also be further broken down into drug-related, non-drug related, and cases with motives still undetermined.
Rappler inputs the latest update on the figures in the graph below:
Of all the homicide cases under investigation, 11.34% were found to be drug-related, 45.55% non-drug-related, and 43.17% calling for a better scrutiny of motives.
According to PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management-Case Monitoring Division (DIDM-CMD) chief Senior Superintendent Ferdinand Bartolome, killings are classified by the PNP as drug-related if the victim or the killer are drug suspects, or if the motive for the killing is drug-related.
If the case does not have anything to do with drugs, it is classified as non-drug-related. Should further investigation reveal that a non-drug-related case turns out to have a drug angle later, the case’s count is transferred to drug-related cases.
In a majority of drug-related cases, Bartolome told Rappler, the killings were done to “prevent the victim from divulging detrimental information to the drug trade.”
On the other hand, the majority of the non-drug-related HCUIs were carried out due to a personal grudge, coming from “heated arguments and misunderstanding, personal gain, hatred, revenge, land dispute, love triangle, family feud, atrocities, lust, work-related, road rage, and others.”
Remember: EJK, DUI, HCUI, DPO
It took long for the PNP to settle with the term ""HCUI"" or homicide cases under investigation.
It can be traced all the way to the early months of the Duterte administration in 2016, when the number of vigilante-style killings soared with almost nightly riding-in-tandem shootings and dumping of corpses in canals and streets. Many bodies bore signs of torture before their final breaths, and were left with cartons labeling them as drug suspects.
These were matched by the rising numbers of killings in police operations because of suspects allegedly fighting back (""nanlaban"").
Given these circumstances, human rights advocates and critics alleged the existence of extrajudicial killings or EJKs, referring to those killed in the streets and those killed by cops during anti-drug operations. The term easily became part of the public lingo, inviting scrutiny of the PNP.
In response, the government created the term deaths under investigation (DUI), intended to distinguish killings that were committed outside the government's campaign from those that were part of police operations. It has the same definition as today's HCUI: murder and homicide cases combined, excluding killings by cops in police operations.
EJKs? A dead body with a sign board lays on the road in Tondo, Manila on July 28, 2016.
File photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler
The PNP regularly released the number of DUIs, just to show that they were keeping a record of the deaths and that most were not drug-related.
The killings that happened under police operations, on the other hand, were said to involve suspects who ""died during police operations"" or simply ""DPO"". They died because they allegedly resisted searches or arrests. While all were presumed to be regular by the PNP, allegations persist that DPOs are the same as EJKs.
Reports have accused cops of mercilessly gunning down defenseless drug suspects then planting evidence to make it appear that the accused put up a fight. Things came to a head with the explosive case of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos.
Based on Rappler’s timeline, the PNP tried to discreetly introduce the term ""HCUI"" in March 2017. 
Why the change? According to the PNP’s Bartolome, they simply didn’t want to confuse the international community.
“Because abroad, DUI meant driving under the influence [of alcohol],” he told Rappler. Without a formal announcement about the shift, some media outlets continue to use the popular term DUI.
Whatever label the government uses to distinguish deaths, however, the killings continue to rise.
Troubled regions
Below is a chart showing the total number of killings per region and how efficient they are at solving them:
The country’s two most developed regions, Metro Manila and Calabarzon, are where almost a third of the killings happen. Metro Manila accounts for 18.06% while Calabarzon accounts for 13.25% of all HCUIs.
The northern Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and Mimaropa, meanwhile, have recorded the least HCUIs with 271 and 432, respectively.
Of the 23,518 killings, 12,470 have either been cleared or solved. This gives the PNP a crime solution efficiency rate of 53.02% for HCUIs.
HCUIs: An accomplishment?
Are killings something to be proud of?
When Malacañang recorded HCUIs as an accomplishment of the Duterte administration’s anti-drug campaign in its 2017 yearend report, it raised a lot of brows.
The report was prepared by the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), which also manages the government’s #RealNumbersPH initiative.
The HCUI numbers were placed in the summary, despite the PNP already clarifying back in August 2016 that not all of them can be linked to the government’s anti-illegal drugs campaign.
Shown a #RealNumbersPH card which included HCUIs as achievements, PNP DIDM chief Director Elmo Sarona said the PNP had never considered the numbers as accomplishments.
 
The two-star general surmised that the number was added to show that the government was being transparent, and is exhausting all efforts to lower the number.
But, the report did not break down the number into how many of the cases were already solved. It just announced thousands of deaths, complete with an icon of a dead man with blood streaming from his body. (READ: A look at the state of crime, drugs in the Philippines)
Is it a communications mishap? The PNP doesn’t think so, given that their officials meet with PCOO officers monthly to update the numbers. Rappler has reached out to PCOO Assistant Secretary Queenie Rodulfo for the Palace’s reason for including HCUIs in its accomplishment report.
In stopping the numbers from rising, the PNP continues to move with the mentality that bringing down illegal drugs will also bring down crime. As records have already shown, the strategy appears to be working for all crimes, except for the gravest one: killings.
The PNP now faces the challenge of bringing down the number of killings, an achievement that it has yet to be proud of. – Rappler.com

The December 2019 survey results released late Sunday, January 12, showed that 33% of Filipinos said that the abuses are “very many” while 42% said “somewhat many” – totaling 76% for “many.""
The respondents were asked: “In the course of the administration’s war on illegal drugs, would you say that the number of abuses of human rights, for example the Extrajudicial Killings or EJKs, has been… (Very many, Somewhat many, Only a few, or Very few)?”
At least 24% said there were few – 21% only a few and 3% very few.
According to SWS, the survey was conducted from December 13 to 16, 2019 via face-to-face interviews among 1,200 people equally distributed across 4 geographic areas. The margin of error was ±3% for national and ±6% each for Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
Duterte’s drug war has been heavily criticized for the high number of killings. Data shows that more than 6,000 people have been killed in anti-drug operations by police alone, while human rights groups estimate there may be as many as 27,000 deaths, including victims of vigilante-style killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
The situation in the Philippines tagged by groups as a “human rights crisis” has been at the center of attention of many international groups, including the United Nations.
The UN Human Rights Council in July 2019 adopted a resolution which, among others, asked UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to write a comprehensive report on the situation in the Philippines and present it to the council. 
The December 2019 SWS survey also found that more than half of Filipinos back this action.
Results show that at least 56% of respondents agreed with the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)’s resolution calling for an investigation into the extrajudicial killings related to the drug war. Results also indicated that 20% disagreed while 24% remain undecided.
The figures showed a very strong net agreement of +36.
How the Duterte administration responded: In a statement on Monday, January 13, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo brushed aside the fact a big majority of Filipinos saw many human rights abuses and instead played up the SWS' findings that 73% of Filipinos said the present number of users of illegal drugs has ""fallen"" since Duterte took office in 2016.Panelo maintained a false narrative that human rights abuses and drug-related killings in Duterte's landmark anti-illegal drug campaign were a result of victims ""fighting back"" against police. (A Rappler investigation has found strong indications that the police were outsourcing extrajudicial killings. Several victim testimonies also debunk claims they ""fought"" against police.)Panelo said the Duterte administration was ""determined to punish to the fullest state agents who abuse their authority,"" as he welcomed victims and witnesses of human rights abuses to file cases with the government.""As the President says, as against them, there will be hell to pay. We encourage those who are victims of - or who are witnesses to - these abuses to come forward and file complaints so that justice will be served,"" he said.Killings which are being criminally investigated have not shown promising results, with the thousands going unsolved as of 2019.  (READ: Duterte gov't allows 'drug war' deaths to go unsolved)
On January 7, SWS also released survey results which showed that 78% of Filipinos believe the Philippine National Police (PNP) has ""ninja cops"" or cops who sell drugs they seize in operations.
SWS said that the items on people’s opinion about the war on drugs are non-commissioned and are done on its “own initiative and released as a public service.” – with a report from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com

Up to 500 people, most of them students of Adamson University, came to hear Mass on Monday, July 25, when Duterte addressed both houses of Congress for the first time.
Presided over by Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo, the Mass marked the launch of the ""Huwag Kang Papatay"" (Thou Shall Not Kill) campaign initiated by the Archdiocese of Manila.
This is the first major movement of Catholics in the Archdiocese of Manila against recent extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.
The killings come as Duterte wages a bloody war against illegal drugs. This war has killed at least 300 people – a figure that includes those slain in legitimate police operations and those who died through extrajudicial means. 
In his homily on Monday, Pabillo condemned extrajudicial killings in the war against illegal drugs, saying crime cannot stop crime.
Fr Atilano Fajardo, minister of public affairs of the Manila Archdiocese, described targets of summary killing as ""sacrificial victims"" whose deaths will make the anti-drug war seem like a success.
'Suspects only'
The Mass for these victims on Monday was ""very solemn"" and ""very profound"", Focolare Movement member Grace Ceniza said. 
""Prayer is very powerful,"" Ceniza said. ""In the Mass, we unite our prayer to Jesus. It is Jesus who is praying, not only us.""
Adamson University student council official Keith Baluyut, for his part, said students are one with the victims of extrajudicial killings.
""Walang sinumang puwedeng kumuha ng buhay natin kung hindi ang Diyos lamang. 'Wag tayong matakot ipaglaban ng ating karapatan,"" Baluyut said. (There is no one who can get our lives besides God. Let us not be afraid to fight for our rights.)
Baluyut added that regardless of religion, his fellow students ""know that there is a right, and that right is to live in this world.""
Jose Que, a lay minister from Navotas who came to the church straight from the Batasang Pambansa, said that the victims were ""suspects only."" 
Que added: ""Kapag bubuhayin nila ang death penalty, isama na nila ang plunderer, itong mga mayayaman na ito – sina Enrile, Binay. Kung talagang isasakatotohanan nila. E 'di sila unahin nila.""

Only 3% think the problem is ""not serious at all"" while 22% were undecided. (READ: Impunity: In the name of the father)
Trust issues with PNP
Filipinos still have trust issues with the Philippine National Police (PNP) when it comes to their implementation of the anti-illegal drugs campaign, according to the survey.
Of the respondents, 29% don't believe in the PNP's claim that they only kill drug suspects who violently resist arrest (16% ""definitely not the truth,"" 13% ""probably not the truth""). (READ: 'Nanlaban sila': Duterte's war on drugs)
Meanwhile, 28% believe the police (19% ""probably the truth,"" 9% ""definitely the truth"").
But the remaining 42% were still not sure what to believe.
Despite the fears and uncertainty, Duterte's anti-drugs campaign still netted a +77 or ""excellent"" public satisfaction rating.
A majority of respondents, 85% to be exact, were satisfied with the ""drug war"" (53% ""very satisfied,"" 32% ""somewhat satisfied"").
Only 8% were dissatisfied while 7% were undecided.
A large majority of respondents, 88%, even agreed that the Duterte administration has reduced the illegal drug problem in their area (56% ""strongly agree,"" 32% ""somewhat agree"").
Only 3% don't agree while 9% were undecided.
The Palace assured the public on Monday that law-abidizing citizens have nothing to fear from government.
""We recognize our people’s concern as we assure them that the government’s anti-drug operations are not aimed at poor, innocent, hapless individuals,"" said Communications Secretary Martin Andanar in a press statement.
He emphasized that police follow the procedures during anti-drug operations.
""What our authorities are conducting are legitimate police operations that require observance of operational protocols.  Police authorities who violate procedures are made to answer before the law,"" said Andanar.
Since the start of Duterte's term, 6,065 people have been killed in drug-related incidents as of early December 2016. Of this number, 2,102 were killed in police operations as of December 14 while 3,933 were victims of extrajudicial killings.
Duterte has insisted the extrajudicial killings are not the work of government but by drug personalities and other criminals.
But human rights activists and his critics have said his colorful threats against drug suspects may be creating a culture of impunity that encourages the killings, whether or not state-sponsored.
The PNP, however, insists they conduct anti-drug operations properly and only shoot when suspects resist arrest. (READ: Dela Rosa to Senate: We are not butchers)

MANILA, Philippines – As he opened Mindanao's largest drug rehabilitation center, President Rodrigo Duterte said he has asked God to make sure victims of extrajudicial killings (EJKs) go to heaven.
""You enjoy your human rights there in heaven kasi (because) God promised you that victims of EJKs go to heaven. 'Yan ang sabi ko sa Diyos (that's what I told God),"" he said on Friday, August 3.
He was giving a speech after unveiling the marker for the P500-million Northern Mindanao Wellness and Reintegration Center donated by a group of Chinese businessmen. The center is touted as proof that his administration is serious about rehabilitating drug addicts.

MANILA, Philippines – The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has been haunted by issues related to his intense anti-illegal drug campaign.
An “unprecedented” rise in the number of deaths in both police operations and vigilante-style killings was observed since the bloody war on drugs was launched in July 2016.
As of April 23 this year, 2,717 suspected drug personalities have been killed in legitimate police operations since the start of the Duterte administration, according to data from the Philippine National Police (PNP). There are, however, 3,603 deaths that still remain under investigation. (READ: IN NUMBERS: Philippines' 'war on drugs’)
The alleged extrajudicial killings that happened in a span of less than a year bore similarities to each other. The narration of witnesses of killings were all too familiar.  
Were there observable common patterns in the reported extrajudicial killings? Here’s what Rappler found out:
Suspected drug personalities whose lifeless and wrapped bodies end up on the streets were abducted beforehand, according to witnesses. More often than not, the abductors were armed men wearing masks.  
Usually, the victims were at their most vulnerable during the time of abduction: either working or at home with their families.
This is what happened to Heart de Chavez in January 2017. Her family narrated that they were all asleep when big burly men wearing masks barged into their home and dragged Heart out. They found her lifeless body with a bullet in her cheek inside an empty house not far from their own.
It was what happened to 22-year-old Rowena Tiamson who never went home after going out to enroll for her last semester in college. 
 
Rowena’s body was found on July 19, 2016 hands tied and face wrapped in packing tape. Around her neck was a cardboard sign with the all-too-familiar phrase, “Huwag tularan, pusher (Don’t emulate me. I’m a pusher).” Her family insisted she never used drugs. 
 The state Rowena was discovered after being abducted was replicated so many times in the last 9 months. 
Suspected drug personalities were reported missing and their bodies were later found with their heads wrapped in packing tape and hands tied with a cord. 
How does the public know it’s drug-related? Through a cardboard bearing the words, “drug pusher ako, huwag tularan (I’m a drug pusher, don’t emulate me).” 
There were cases when packets of shabu were found inside the pockets of the victims. 
People who were suspected of doing or peddling illegal drugs were also killed on the spot.  
According to witnesses’ accounts, perpetrators were often armed men wearing civilian clothes. They barged into the victims’ houses and emptied their magazines on them. Sometimes, they dragged them out to narrow alleys. 
On October 31, 2016, 5 suspected drug personalities were massacred in Barangay Addition Hills in Mandaluyong City. The killers were 6 armed men who wore helmets to cover their faces. (READ: Impunity: A Halloween massacre)  
One witness in the Addition Hills massacre narrated that she heard the victims begging the killers to stop. She heard one of them, a woman, cry out that she would surrender. 
It’s the same narrative from several other witnesses. They insisted that the victims wailed and begged the perpetrators to stop, only to be ignored. They also insisted that their son, brother, husband, or friend did not do anything wrong and begged to just be arrested, and not killed on the spot. 
There were cases where the families themselves were assaulted.  
It was what happened to Nenita Sumilang, mother of 18-year-old Joshua who was dragged out of their house by armed men. She said that a Tondo policeman named Ronald Alvarez aimed a gun at her as she begged them to just jail her son.  
In a separate incident in Tondo, Rowena Appari passed out after being hit and kicked by one of the 5 armed men who barged into their home and eventually killed her son Rex while his girlfriend, Lori Ann, and their 10-month-old son knelt and cried in an alley near their house. 
But these pleas often fell on deaf ears. 
Suspected drug personalities were killed by gun shots, usually to the head, as their families wailed nearby.  
Their lifeless, bloodied bodies lay slumped as the killers left the scene. In several cases, families and investigators recovered packets of shabu and a rusty gun sans a serial number (often .38 caliber) near the body.  
The presence of these elements in the crime scene – a gun and illegal drugs – supported the claim that the victims fought back or that they were indeed drug addicts. 
There were also cases when victims were killed by armed men aboard a motorcycle. Sometimes, after gunning down their targets, the killers threw a piece of paper identifying the victim as a drug pusher.
This was what happened to 21-year-old Jerico Camitan and 17-year-old Erica Fernandez who were both killed by gunmen on a motorycle in Quezon City in October 2016, according to witnesses. Near Jerico’s body was a cardboard that said “Tulak ka, hayop ka (You’re a pusher, you are an animal)!”
It was the same thing that happened to Roman Clifford “Oman” Manaois in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. A witness recalled that after his companion was shot, 20-year-old Oman held up his hands, seemingly asking for mercy, when the gunmen wearing bonnets turned and killed him. (READ: Drug user? No, Oman was a good son)
Concern over drug war
Amid the rise in the number of killings and the similarities among them, Duterte allies are quick to dismiss criticisms aimed at the administration's war on drugs. Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, in fact, insisted before the United Nations on May 8, 2017 that there is no new wave of killings in the Philippines. (READ: Cayetano to UN: No new wave of killings in PH)
The denial, however, did not deter at least 45 UN member-countries from expressing concern over the human rights situation in the country. During the Universal Periodic Review, the Philippine government was asked to investigate and put an end to the extrajudicial killings in the war on drugs.  (READ: Countries call for end to killings in PH drug war)
The constant denial of the government has not halted the killings.

Nowadays we have that ubiquitous cardboard saying “Drug pusher, huwag tularan.” Like the activists during Arroyo’s time, suspected drug users and dealers are subject to public villification through “Oplan Tokhang.” They are forced into surrendering and admitting guilt on the basis of a nebulous list drawn up by the police and barangay officials. In fact, many of those who surrendered have succumbed to vigilante killings. Police say the killings are part of the drug syndicates’ effort to cleanse its ranks.
Alleged criminals killed in police operations are another disturbing matter. The rise in incidents of drug suspects reportedly killed while trying to resist arrest are too dramatic to be given a presumption of regularity. A number have telltale signs of a rubout as acknowledged by the police themselves.
What makes today’s EJKs particularly complicated is that the victims are considered undesirable members of society. Unlike activists or revolutionaries, drug addicts and pushers have no redeeming quality. These are not idealists being killed for exercising their constitutional rights or addressing legitimate social grievances. Druggies, for most people, are the scum of the earth that should be wiped out from existence.
Notice that when activists or rebels are summarily executed, their families and the communities that they have served immediately demand justice. Human rights groups, whose orientation has traditionally been, and for good reason, to protect the rights of political dissenters immediately investigate and act to prevent more killings. Networks of organizations are easily formed to hold the perpetrators to account.
On the other hand, when drug dealers are killed, their families hang their heads in shame and the community silently rejoices at the loss of another troublemaker. Everything is accepted as a consequence of the victims’ alleged illegal activities.
The challenges
If we are to stop the killings, the first challenge is for the public to denounce it. Like in so many issues, public opposition, or better yet outrage, is needed for the government to change its policy.
Unfortunately, whenever people are painted as rebels, terrorists or criminals, it becomes difficult to denounce their killing. The initial indifference when activists started getting killed during the Arroyo regime is similar to today’s ambivalence in the face of the killings of suspected drug addicts and pushers. Oftentimes it is only when the obviously innocent are killed – like children and nursing mothers – that the public is moved to denounce EJKs.
Denouncing the killings should not mean condoning the alleged illegal activities of its victims. What it should translate to is a demand for the police and military to follow the law and respect due process and human rights, so that criminals can be properly punished in accordance with what is in the law.
The second challenge is for the families and friends of the victims of EJKs to stand up and demand for justice. It is understandable that many of them would rather sweep the killings under the rug, considering the stigma of being linked to suspected drug criminals. However, it would be difficult for government agencies like the Commission on Human Rights, National Police Commission, Department of Justice, or human rights organizations and civil society organizations, to be taking up the cudgels for people who do not want to be helped in the first place.
The third challenge is for human rights groups to expand their advocacy to include those whose rights are violated on the basis of purely criminal, non-political offences. While the traditional political orientation of human rights advocacy is as important as ever, urgent attention is needed for atrocities committed in the course of Duterte’s war on drugs and other anti-crime campaigns. Such a challenge will not be easy, considering that most human rights groups are already so stretched in terms of resources and manpower in dealing with political and counter-insurgency related human rights violations.
Because the use of EJKs is an unwritten state policy in the Philippines, the only way to prevent it is for the people themselves to demand a stop to the practice. – Rappler.com

This, said Roque, is the ""hypocrisy"" underlying the statements of De Lima and Gascon, critics of President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war.
The spokesman's statement Monday, December 11, read: ""How is it now that when drug pushers or users die, Senator De Lima and Chairman Gascon insist that these are EJKs? Their sudden about-face is baffling given that these drug pushers and users are not members or affiliated with any political, environmental, agrarian, or labor organization. These drug pushers or users are likewise not journalists.""
De Lima, as justice secretary under the Aquino administration, had signed the operational guidelines for implementing Administrative Order No 35 which gave a definition of extrajudicial killings that excludes the killing of drug personalities.
For the CHR, it was its former chairperson Loretta Rosales who served as ""observer"" when the document was signed, not Gascon.
The guidelines defined extrajudicial killings (EJK) as killings in which the victim is a member or affiliate of an organization, including those with political, environmental, agrarian, labor, or similar causes; or is an advocate of such causes. The victim can also be a media practitioner.
An EJK victim, according to the document, may also be someone ""apparently mistaken or identified"" to be any of the above.
That De Lima and Gascon are not adhering to the AO's definition of EJK exposes the politicized nature of their criticisms against Duterte's drug war, said Roque.
""If the two believed then that the AO they adopted was correct and in accordance with the law, they should be the first to defend the Duterte administration’s campaign against illegal drugs because the AO No. 35 signed by former President Benigno Aquino III is correct,"" said Duterte's spokesman.
However, if the two vocal critics do not agree with the definition made by Aquino's AO, they should ""admit to the nation and to the world that what they did...was wrong and that Aquino only signed AO No. 35 so that his administration would not be blamed for the deaths of drug pushers and users during his presidency,"" he said.
""It is high time that the hypocrisies of Senator De Lima and Chairman Gascon are exposed in favor of the truth.  The Filipino people deserve no less,"" said the Palace spokesman.
The CHR had previously assailed the use of the AO's definition for extrajudicial killings, saying it is ""limiting"" and discounts other killings perpetrated by state agents and non-state actors.
This was after the Philippine National Police used the AO definition as basis for saying there have been zero cases of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration.
The commission sticks to the definition provided by former United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston – that the term extrajudicial killing refers to ""any killing by government forces as well as killings by any other groups or individuals which the government fails to investigate, prosecute, and punish when it is in a position to do so."" – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippine – President Rodrigo Duterte has broken his promise to help the country’s marginalized sector by targeting poor Filipinos in his war on drugs, a human rights group said.
In its latest report, the Philippine Human Rights Information Center (PhilRights), called Duterte’s anti-illegal drugs campaign a war on the poor as victims are often  from low-income communities. 
The effect goes beyond death, said PhilRights Executive Director Nymia Simbulan, as the campaign has pushed victims' families into severe poverty. For every death in the drug war, a family is left behind. 
“Isang kahig, isang tuka ang mga pamilya ng mga biktima,” she said on Wednesday, September 19. “Mas lalo pa itong lumala nang napatay ang primary breadwinner ng pamilya.”
(These families have a hand-to-mouth existence. It became much worse when their primary breadwinner was killed.) 
In its analysis and documentation of at least 58 extrajudicial killing cases referred to PhiRights by families themselves, the group found that the victims were “male adults within productive age range, primary breadwinners, low- or irregular-wage earners, of low educational attainment, and residents of urban poor communities.”
“Ang mga babae ang sumasalo sa mga responsibilidad na naiwan ng asawa nilang napatay (The women take over the responsibilities left by their husbands killed in the drug war). They carry the burden of working and being a single parent,"" Simbulan said.
Immediate support needed
Members of these families, especially children, face trauma and stigmatization that can haunt them their whole lives. 
Simbulan said these families need immediate livelihood aid, as well as medical assistance and emotional support.  
“Marami dito (A lot of them) do not have high educational background so you can expect that they will end up with jobs in the informal economy, low income and irregular jobs. For families with an average...of two to 3 children, that is not enough,"" she said.
The anti-drug campaign has claimed 4,500 lives in police operations alone. Human rights groups, meanwhile, estimate the number to reach more than 20,000, to include victims of vigilante killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Duterte and his allies, however, have continuously dismissed criticisms from both local and international human rights groups. The government has also refused to heed efforts for investigations into the systematic killings. (READ: Climate of fear: Justice remain elusive 2 years into Duterte's drug war)
“Hindi normal sa kahit sinong tao ang matuwa kapag may namatay (It's not normal for anyone to be happy if someone dies) especially if there's no concrete evidence that that person committed a crime,” said Virginia Suarez, PhilRights Board of Trustees director.
“We refuse to see them as simply numbers even if the government only sees them as such because to us, they are human beings with faces and families,” she added. – Rappler.com

In his homily, Villanueva also said disrespecting others is like blaspheming God.
""Kapag ang tao ay dinuraan mo, para mo na ring dinuraan ang Diyos. 'Pag ang tao, niloko mo, niloloko mo rin ang Diyos. Kapag ang tao, sinampal mo sa mukha, para mo ring sinasampal ang Diyos. Kapag ang tao, minahal mo, minamahal mo rin ang Diyos,"" Villanueva said.
(If you spit on other people, it's like you're spitting on God. If you fool other people, it's like you're fooling God. If you slap a person on the face, it's like you're also slapping God. If you love a person, you're also loving God.)

As of January 2017, over 2,500 suspected drug personalities have been killed in police operations alone.
One issue that has generated a lot of debate in the death count related to the war on drugs is how to interpret the numbers that the Philippine National Police (PNP) has tagged as ""deaths under investigation"" (DUI).
The police had never used the term ""deaths under investigation"" until after the Duterte administration assumed office. Reporters who have been covering the beat for a long time will also confirm that this had never been used in police statements and releases. Even Google search results yield negative results on the use of this term by authorities before August 2016. 
Reporters covering the police beat started reporting more frequently in the first few months of the anti-illegal drug campaign about people found dead in the streets, some appearing to have been killed vigilante-style. Some of the early corpses were shown bound in packing tape with cardboard signs labelling them as drug pushers.
To illustrate how the use of the term DUI has muddled the issue of the death count, we timeline events that led to the use of the term, as well as how the PNP's description of it evolved. 
The highlights of this timeline reveal the following:
July 7, 2016
The Philippine Daily Inquirer published its ""Kill List,"" which tracks killings related to the anti-drug war monitored by its reporters. The list includes vigilante-style killings and individuals killed as a result of police operations.
July 13, 2016
ABS-CBN published its MAP, CHARTS: The Death Toll of the War on Drugs.
August 2, 2016
Senator Leila de Lima, who then chaired the Senate committee on justice, delivered a privilege speech about the killings which triggered a Senate investigation on the issue. 
August 6, 2016
Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno ordered PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa to probe alleged extrajudicial killings (EJK) both in police operations and in reported vigilante-style deaths. 
August 15, 2016
Senator Panfilo Lacson cited PNP statistics saying there had been 681 ""vigilante killings"" or those that happened outside legitimate police operations from July 1 to August 3. Lacson noted that this number is higher than the 612 drug suspects killed in police operations from July 1 to August 15. Lacson admonished the PNP to stop the vigilante killings.
August 18, 2016
Dela Rosa used the term ""deaths under investigation"" (DUI) for the first time in a hearing by the Senate committee on public order regarding possible revisions to laws that would help anti-illegal drug efforts.
The PNP chief said there were 899 deaths falling under this category from July 1 to August 15. Among these, 22 cases were filed in court. These DUIs, added Dela Rosa, took place outside legitimate police operations.
In a press briefing after the hearing, Dela Rosa further described the term DUI.
""Those are the dead who were just found floating along canals, the dead who were dumped along roads with their hands tied and their faces, eyes, and mouths taped. Also those killed by riding-in-tandem, or those who were just shot. Those are the deaths under investigation,"" Dela Rosa said.
August 23, 2016
In a Senate hearing on reported EJKs, Dela Rosa said not all DUIs are drug-related. He also said motives in at least 757 deaths at the time had yet to be determined.
September 2016
The PNP Public Information Office (PIO) started sending DUI statistics to PNP beat reporters, along with numbers for Project Double Barrel and Oplan TokHang.
The DUI statistics just listed one figure for the total number of victims. It also gave the total number of cases or incidents, distinguished between those currently being investigated (DUI) and those with investigation concluded (IC) or cases filed in court.
September 13, 2016
Rappler published its ""In Numbers"" story, tracking the number of deaths or victims linked to the ""war on drugs"", based on data sent by the PNP to reporters.
There was no breakdown for the motives of these DUIs, whether drug-related or not, because these were not reflected in the data given to reporters. This continued until the suspension of Project Double Barrel in January 2017.
September 15, 2016
In the PNP PIO's DUI data update, it added this note: ""DUIs are not automatically extrajudicial killings nor vigilante/summary killings. DUIs are murder and/or homicide [cases] that are still under investigation.""
September 19, 2016
The PNP sent a letter to Rappler, saying that cases of DUIs ""cannot all be attributed to the 'war on drugs', unless it is determined as such through proper investigation.""
October 10, 2016
Police Superintendent Henry Libay, head secretariat of PNP's Task Force Usig explained, ""Out of 1,866 deaths under investigation, only 685 are drug-related."" Libay mentioned other motives like personal grudge and robbery or theft, but did not provide a breakdown.
October 28, 2016
The PNP replied to a Rappler researcher, denying a request for specific details of those killed during legitimate and outside police operations ""because it may compromise our ongoing investigations, operations and other related activities in relation to Project Double Barrel.""
November 25, 2016
The administration launched its eFOI portal. A number of individuals filed requests for progress on ""deaths under investigation."" 
December 8, 2016
PNP chief Dela Rosa told reporters that only a third of over 3,000 DUI cases at that point were drug-related. The rest ""are normal cases of murder, homicide, [those killed by riding-in-tandem suspects], parricide.""
Dela Rosa also used different criteria in classifying a death as DUI. 
""Na-validate na talagang hindi ka involved sa drugs pero namatay ka, death under investigation dahil unknown ‘yung killer, assailant mo. Lumabas ngayon na hindi ka pala drug-related.""
(For example, it was validated that you were not really involved in drugs, but you died, so that's death under investigation because your killer or assailant was unknown. It appeared now that your death wasn't drug-related.)
He likewise claimed some of the deaths were caused by guns-for-hire taking advantage of the anti-illegal drug campaign.
January 2, 2017
In a document showing a recapitulation (summary) of the DUI figures, the PNP defined DUI as ""murder cases outside police operations, regardless of the motive which [has] yet to be cleared or solved.""
January 9, 2017
The PNP PIO gave the last update on DUI to police beat reporters.
It showed that there were 3,603 victims in 3,271 cases or incidents of DUIs. There were also 922 victims in 875 cases with investigation concluded and filed in court. There is no breakdown as to how many victims died in drug-related and non-drug-related incidents.
Statistics on DUIs and cases with investigation concluded as of January 9, 2017.
Below is a graph of DUI figures received from the PNP PIO from September 2016 to January 2017.
After the suspension of Project Double Barrel Alpha on January 30, the PNP did not release a document showing breakdowns for DUI and IC [investigation concluded] figures, at least in terms of motives, to PNP beat reporters. 
They only mentioned these breakdowns in press briefings and statements.
February 1, 2017
The PNP reacted via a statement to an Amnesty International report, which detailed stories of alleged police corruption and abuse in the war on drugs:
""... [O]f the 4,744 murders under investigation that both local and foreign observers wrongfully refer to as 'extrajudicial killing', 3,459 were determined to be non-drug related incidents, 662 of which were motivated by personal grudge, 15 were related to property dispute, 16 were crimes of passion, 10 were 'rido' or family feud, 11 were work-related, and 2 were atrocities committed by threat groups.""
Notice, however, that the breakdown of non-drug-related incidents only add up to 716, leaving 2,743 deaths unaccounted for. 
""On the other hand, only 1,285 incidents had something to do with the victim's association with drug activities,"" the PNP's statement said. 
March 15, 2017
PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos disputed Vice President Robredo's use of the 7,080 figure. He said, out of over 4,000 DUIs, only 682 cases were found to be drug-related. The rest ""are regular crimes happening on the street.""
Curiously, the number of drug-related cases appears to have ""decreased"", from 1,285 in its statement in response to the Amnesty International report.
March 23, 2017
A document obtained upon request by Rappler shows an updated summary of the figures.
In the summary, the PNP once again changed the way they described the deaths. The document now refers to DUIs as ""homicide cases under investigation"" (HCUI) and IC as ""filed in court"" (FC).
From July 1, 2016 to March 21, 2017, there were 1,370 incidents with drug-related motives and 894 non-drug-related ones. 
The PNP also said there are 3,560 incidents with ""motive to be determined.""
The data appears to have included statistics for Project Double Barrel Reloaded.
Statistics as of March 21, 2017, provided by the PNP upon request, on DUI cases, which are now referred to as homicide cases under investigation.
'
Note that the PNP released a breakdown only for incidents in terms of drug-related and non-drug-related ones.
Some incidents documented in the previous months resulted in multiple victims.
The breakdown given for victims was not according to motive, but according to whether the cases were ""cleared"" (suspect was identified and charged in court) or ""not cleared."" 
As for 1,433 cases/incidents filed in court, 105 were found to be drug-related (42 with suspects arrested, plus 63 at-large), and 1,328 were not (803 with suspects arrested plus 525 at-large).
On March 23, Rappler requested for a breakdown of the number of victims in DUI/HCUI and IC/FC cases by motive. 
In its response on March 27, however, the PNP only released statistics similar to the one shown above, with no breakdown of victims by motive.
The document also does not isolate the numbers recorded between July 1, 2016 and January 31, 2017 – or during the first round of PNP's anti-illegal drugs campaign – as requested by Rappler. This mixes up categories used in a previous data set with a newer data set released this March, creating even more confusion in the interpretation of the data. – with Michael Bueza, Bea Cupin, Gemma Mendoza and Wayne Manuel/Rappler.com"

De Lima said this on Tuesday, February 14, as some of her supporters from the Every Woman group went to her office ahead of her supposed impending arrest.
""Sakali lang po mangyari na, God forbid, sana ilagay naman ako sa isang lugar na safe and secure ako. Kasi marami na hong nangyayari 'di ba, pinapapatay sa loob ng selda, so what is another EJK?"" De Lima said.
(If ever it happens, God forbid, I hope they put me in a place that is safe and secure. Because there are many things happening, many people are killed inside prison. So what is another EJK?)
De Lima is the staunchest critic of President Rodrigo Duterte and his deadly war on drugs. She drew the ire of the President anew when she initiated a Senate probe into the spate of extrajudicial killings under his administration. Duterte, in turn, went all out against the senator, accusing her of being a drug coddler and vowing she would be jailed.
De Lima, however, has no ""safe"" location in mind yet. The senator said she is not requesting any special treatment, as she just wants to be secure wherever she will be detained, citing the case of former Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr who was killed inside prison.
""Pinagiisipan pa saan 'yung safe. I don't think I would be safe in a regular jail facility. I'm not asking [for] any special or VIP treatment. Basta ba siguraduhin lang nila na it's a safe and secure area,"" De Lima said.
(We are still thinking where I'll be safe. I don't think I would be safe in a regular jail facility. I'm not asking for any special or VIP treatment. They better make sure that it's a safe and secure area.)
Asked where possible threats could come from, she said: ""It can be from anywhere. Kasi parati naman akong may threats. 'Yung kay Mayor Espinosa, 'yung mga wala pa ring katapusan [na patayan] (Because I'm always receiving threats. The case of Mayor Espinosa, the endless extrajudicial killings), and I'm being tagged as Bilibid drug trade queen, tagged as public enemy number one of Solicitor General [Jose] Calida, so you can never tell if there are groups interested in eliminating me.""
Despite such fears, De Lima said she would not resist arrest.
""Wala naman akong magagawa (I cannot do anything), I am morally and psychologically resisting it, because I'm innocent. But physically, I cannot resist,"" the senator said.
""'Di po ako tatakas, 'di po ako magtatago, 'di po ako pupunta ng ospital, 'di po ako mag-wi-wheelchair o mag-ne-neck brace. Wala po akong gagawin na gano'ng istilo,"" De Lima said, referring to the common ""style"" of politicians who are facing charges.
(I will not escape, hide, or go to a hospital. I will not be in a wheelchair or wear a neck brace. I will not resort to such tactics.)
She then jokingly told her supporters: ""Puwede 'nyo po ako samahan sa loob ng presinto at magbantay sa labas. Pero 'wag na sa kulungan. Bisitahin 'nyo na lang po ako."" (You can join me inside the detention facility and just stand guard outside my cell. But not inside my cell. Just visit me.)
The supporters present included former Social Welfare secretary Corazon Soliman, former Peace Process adviser Teresita Deles, former Commission on Human Rights chairperson Etta Rosales, and former Civil Service Commission chairperson Karina David, among others. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Death came two days after a family in Buenavista village in the central Philippine city of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, celebrated Christmas.
It was 7 am, December 27, 2018, when 3 armed men barged into the house and told them to get out. 
Cedine Isugan, 28, was in the kitchen, preparing the day’s first meal. Jesus, her husband, was carrying their 7-month-old son. She was ordered to take the baby from him while he was forced to lie face down at gunpoint. Confused about what was happening, she asked the men, ""why us?"" They didn't bother to reply.
“There were dozens of them surrounding the village – all armed and masked. We could only see the print on their shirts that says ‘Police,’” she said. 
The armed men dragged Jesus to the backyard while the others talked to the villagers, mostly women and children, who were gathered outside. 
“I heard 3 gunshots,” she said. Cedine knew that moment that her husband was in danger, but she was prevented from taking a closer look. 
There was a sudden uncontrollable fear in Cedine, and when she was finally allowed to get near her husband, she saw his blood flowing on the barren land. She hesitated to touch his lifeless body – until their two-year-old daughter walked toward her father and innocently tried to wake him up. 
“I can’t believe it. It was nothing to them. It was like killing a pig or a stray dog to them,” she said.
“He should’ve not come home,” Cedine said of Jesus. 
Second attack
The Isugan home was filled with excitement when Jesus came home for a vacation on December 24, 2018. The next day was a big celebration for the family because it was Jesus’ birthday, which coincided with the Christian observance of Jesus Christ’s birth.   
Jesus, a 27-year-old son of a farmer, had worked as a construction laborer in Cebu City for 4 months before he was killed.  
The attack against the Isugan family did not end with the death of Jesus. A few weeks ago, their house was burnt down by unidentified assailants.  
“They are really angry with us. I think it is because of our family’s involvement in the peasant organization,” said Cedine.  
Her parents-in-law are active members of the peasant organization in Negros Oriental that helps farmers with land disputes and unfair labor practices.  
Spate of killings 
A total of 6 people, including Jesus, were killed that day in December. Their bodies were put in a sack and paraded in front of a police headquarters in Negros.  
It was a joint operation of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police,  called “Oplan Sauron,” against suspected communist rebels, criminals, and those involved in illegal drugs. 
According to the police report, some 26 suspects, including 53-year-old Delia Isuga, Jesus’ mother, were arrested. At least 61 firearms, 12 explosives, and hundreds of ammunition were seized. Six people “resisted arrest” and were killed after they “engaged in a shootout” with the law enforcers.
Oplan Sauron was a response of the state forces to President Rodrigo Duterte’s Memorandum Order No. 32, which he signed on November 22, 2018. The order aimed to “suppress lawless violence” in the provinces in Negros, Samar, and Bicol “in order to prevent further loss of innocent lives.” 
On March 30, 2019, the second wave of Oplan Sauron claimed the lives of 14 people in 3 towns of Negros Oriental.  
Carmela Avelino, 42, recalled how her husband Edgardo, 59, died in the hands of the police in Canlaon City. 
It happened before sunrise. “They did not knock. They just entered and woke us up.”
Carmela was sleeping in her daughter’s room while Edgardo was on his favorite cot behind a huge dresser near the door.  
“Everyone was shouting. They told us to go out of the house. I ran and chased my daughter, who hurried outside because of fear of the armed men,” she said.  
She ran past the cot, but did not see her husband, who was already with the armed men in one of the rooms.  
“They told us to go inside the chapel,” she said. “We were so terrified. I was worried because my husband was still inside the house.”  
The chapel turned into a temporary holding area for people who were horrified of the sudden influx of armed men in their village.  
Carmela kept her eyes to the door of their house, waiting for Edgardo to come out, but he didn't – until “3 gunshots were fired.”  
She asked, “Why? Why my husband?” One of the policemen answered, “Because he is a leader of the communist rebels.”  
According to rights group Karapatan, at least 41 people were killed in the Negros provinces from November 2018 to July 28, 2019. 
Another group, the Unyon ng Manggagawa sa Agrikultura, has a list of at least 87 who were killed in Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental.  
Lawyer Maria Sol Taule of Karapatan claimed that the killings in Negros that involved civilians, rights defenders, activists, and farmers are “all state-sponsored.” 
“These killings are part of the intensified campaign against alleged supporters of the revolutionary movement,” she said. 
Taule said the method that the state forces are using “is not far from the method that they are using in the government’s anti-narcotics campaign.”  
She explained that Duterte’s memorandum order “gave the police and military justification to conduct an illegal search, arrest, and even killing.”  
“Then after a series of the so-called legitimate operations, they will use death squads to liquidate more unarmed civilians, mostly peasant leaders and allies of peasant organizations,” she added. 
Before Duterte's memo
The bloodshed that turned Negros Island into a killing field started even before President Duterte issued Memorandum Order No. 32. 
Defend Negros Movement recorded at least 84 political killings from 2017 up to this date. Nadja de Vera, convener of the group, said the order “was just issued to legalize the killings.”  
“The first victim of the extrajudicial killings in Negros since Duterte came to power was Alexander Ceballos on January 20, 2017,” she said. “After that incident, dozens of civilians, whom in one way or another had supported the plight of the farmers in Negros,” followed, she said. 
De Vera said the killings before Duterte’s memorandum order “did not make the headlines because the murders were done one by one on different occasions.” 
But on October 20, 2018, Negros Island became the subject of the lens of the media when 9 farmers were killed after they were fired upon by some 40 armed men at Hacienda Nene in Bulanon village in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. 
The victims, who were members of the National Federation of Sugar Workers, were workers at the plantation that had been placed under the agrarian reform program but remained in the hands of the owners.  
The recent spate of killings from July 23 to 28 in Negros, perpetrated by unidentified armed men, has taken the lives of 14 people, including a one-year-old boy. 
July 25 was the bloodiest when 7 civilians were killed.  
Philippine National Police chief General Oscar Albayalde on July 26 ordered a thorough and immediate investigation into the series of killings.  
National police spokesperson Brigadier General Bernard Banac said they already instructed the regional director “to resolve the series of killings” that they consider “to be crime incidents.” 
Church says no
On July 27, the 4 Catholic bishops of Negros Island issued a collegial pastoral statement urging the end to the “unfolding cycle of violence” that is gripping the province.  
Bishops Gerardo Alminaza of San Carlos, Julito Cortes of Dumaguete, Patricio Buzon of Bacolod, and Louie Galbines of Kabankalan denounced the “total disregard for the primacy and sanctity of human life.”  
“So much blood has already been spilled…. The blood of those killed cries to be heard. It calls out to our basic humanity to be one with those who have been afflicted by this violence,” their statement said.  
They also ordered all parishes to “toll the church bells” every evening at 8 o’clock until the killings stop. 
“In the stillness of the night, the tolling of the bells signifies our communion as Church. We are to remember those who have gone before us – including those whose lives have been snuffed by these killings – they, who are our brothers and sisters,” the statement added. 
The prelates urged the faithful to “pray the Oratio Imperata to end the killings” in the region.  
In a separate interview, Bishop Alminaza said that the “killing of another human being especially without due process… is inhumane, immoral, a violation of human right, and a grievous offense against God.”
The prelate said, “It is not for me to say who really are responsible for all the killings...but if it is committed by those entrusted with the sacred duty to defend life and rights, the killing becomes even more abominable.” 
He also urged the government to “avoid any militarist strategy” and instead “embrace the pathways to peace” through “socio-economic reforms.”  
“Peace cannot be achieved by guns or by killing fellow Filipinos. Once more, we, with the rest of the Filipino people, resonate the call to end the killings and to resume the peace talks,” the prelate added.  
On July 23, General Albayalde said, “Since the results [of Oplan Sauron] were good,” it will continue “not just in Negros but throughout the country.” 
For Cedine, the “violence” that orphaned her children “will not hinder us from seeking justice.” She admitted that she is afraid, but added that she has “the spirit to continue the fight for the right to life.” 
“I will not stop until justice is served. If I couldn’t be there to witness that day to come, I am sure my children will. – Rappler.com

In a survey held from March 25 to 28, 78% of respondents said they were satisfied with the war on drugs (43% very satisfied, 35% somewhat satisfied). On the other hand, 12% said they were unsatisfied (6% somewhat dissatisfied, 6% very dissatisfied).
""This gives a net satisfaction rating of +66, classified by SWS as very good,"" the polling firm said in a release to media.
Net satisfaction on the drug war went down from ""excellent"" to ""very good,"" SWS said.
The March 2017 net satisfaction rating was an 11-point decline from the 77+ rating during a similar survey in December 2016.
The polling firm defines ""net satisfaction"" as the difference between the percentage of those who were satisfied and those who were dissatisfied. The survey has an error margin of 3% for national percentages. 
EJKs, arresting suspects
Most Filipinos in the survey said they were worried that they or anyone they know would be a victim of ""extrajudicial killings.""
They were asked: ""Gaano po kayo nangangamba na kayo o sino mang kilala ninyo ay maging biktima ng 'extrajudicial killing o EJK'? (How worried are you that you or anyone you know will be a victim of 'extrajudicial killing or EJK'?)""
Of those polled, 73% said they were worried (37% very worried, 36% somewhat worried).
During the December 2016 poll, 78% said they were worried that they or someone they know would become EJK victims.
Since the war on drugs began in July 2016, police have noted a spike in murder and homicide cases nationwide, while reporting a decrease in all other crimes. Police have killed over 2,500 drug suspects in police operations and have tallied some 1,500 deaths with links to illegal drugs. Another 3,500 or so deaths are still being investigated. (READ: IN NUMBERS: The Philippines' 'war on drugs')
An overwhelming majority or 92% of respondents think it's important for police to capture drug suspects alive in the campaign on illegal drugs. During the December survey, 94% said keeping suspects alive was important.
Over two-thirds of those polled or 70% of respondents said the administration is serious about solving the problem of EJKs in the country.
Police have insisted that EJKs do not exist in the Philippines, since the killings, they say, are not state-sponsored.
'Nanlaban'?
But Filipinos are still ""split"" over whether they believe the police are telling the truth when they say slain suspects ""fought back"" (nanlaban, in Filipino) during operations.
24% of respondents said police were telling the truth (6% definitely telling the truth, 18% probably telling the truth) while a larger percentage or 44% said they were undecided.
Over 31% of respondents felt police were lying (17% probably not telling the truth, 14% definitely not telling the truth).
Malacañang welcomed the SWS survey results, saying it still showed that a ""great majority"" of Filipinos remain satisfied with the war on drugs ""notwithstanding the negative criticism we received here and abroad.""
""We note that the public (at 70%) believes the current administration is serious about solving the problem of so-called 'extrajudicial killings' (EJKs); and its efforts to cleanse the Philippine National Police,"" said Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella in a statement sent on Wednesday morning, April 19.
He made no mention of the drop in satisfaction with the anti-drug campaign.
The Palace also chose to focus on the bright side when it came to the figures showing that a majority of Filipinos worry about becoming victims of extrajudicial killings. Abella emphasized that the figures show a drop in those with this concern.
""Many Filipinos are less worried about their personal safety; as they feel safe and secure in the streets and at home,"" he said.
Given the support of many Filipinos for the war on drugs, Abella said, ""The drive will be relentless until the drug apparatus is rendered inutile."" – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The human rights violations under President Rodrigo Duterte’s anti-illegal drugs campaign have “reached the threshold of crimes against humanity,” Amnesty International said. 
In its latest report, “They Just Kill,” published on Monday, July 8, the human rights group said the extrajudicial killings are “deliberate and systematic” in nature and appear to be part of a “government-orchestrated attack against poor people” allegedly involved in illegal drugs. 
Duterte’s violent war on drugs has led to at least 6,000 suspected drug personalities killed in police operations. Human rights groups meanwhile pegged the number at more than 20,000 including those killed vigilante-style. (READ: The Impunity Series) 
There is already sufficient evidence to conclude that these incidents constitute crimes against humanity, which are defined as “widespread or systematic attacks directed against any civilian population,” Amnesty International said.  
The report is the second the group released on Duterte's drug war with its 2017 report detailing stories of alleged police corruption and abuse.
Same patterns
The human rights group investigated 20 incidents (18 in police operations with two by unknown individuals) with a total of 27 people killed in Bulacan. The team interviewed a total of 58 people, including families of victims and witnesses of the executions. (READ: Central Luzon: New killing fields in Duterte's drug war)
The report identified patterns in “practically all cases” it examined, including police claims that the victims fought back despite families saying their killed relatives did not own a gun as they have no money to even get one. (READ: In the PH drug war, it's likely EJK when...)
“The victims of the drug-related killings examined by Amnesty International were overwhelmingly from poor and marginalized communities, in line with past research findings showing that the government’s anti-drug efforts chiefly target the poor,” it said. 
The findings of the latest report corroborate previous documentations by Amnesty International and other groups, which also include a “consistent pattern of police tampering with crime scenes, rigging evidence, and falsifying reports.” 
Families are also unable to file cases against those responsible. They told Amnesty International that their requests for documents, including police reports or blotters, are denied.  (READ: Duterte gov't allows 'drug war' deaths to go unsolved)
“Police reports that describe the circumstances of their loved one’s death are necessary for challenging the police’s version of events,” the report said. “As such, building a case almost always hinges upon the sharing of documents by police, which is now a dead end.”
They are also “turned away from police stations, either informed that the relevant investigator was not there, or given the runaround from station to station.”  
These findings are consistent with what other groups, including the Commission on Human Rights, have said pertaining to requests. State agents, mainly the Philippine National Police, have repeatedly denied the release of documents related to the war on drugs. (READ: Evading probes? The many times Duterte admin didn't give drug war documents)
In April 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the release of tens of thousands of documents related to the killings to the Center for International Law (CenterLaw) and the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG). The decision thumbed down Solicitor General Jose Calida’s argument that arguing the release will put national security at risk.
Investigations needed
Amnesty International called on Duterte to end his drug war and enforce a policy that “puts the protection of people’s health and rights at the center,” among others.  
The UN HRC, it said, should “adopt a resolution to create an independent, impartial and effective investigation into human rights violations in the context of the ‘war on drugs,’ including into the commission of crimes under international law, to establish the facts and circumstances, and take steps toward ensuring justice for the victims and their families.”
A resolution filed by Iceland seeking actions against the killings is up for voting at the UN HRC. If approved, it will request rights chief Michelle Bachelet prepare a comprehensive report and will urge the government to cooperate with UN offices and mechanisms by facilitating country visits and “refraining from all acts of intimidation or retaliation.” 
The ICC, meanwhile, is conducting its own preliminary examination which will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that the case against Duterte falls under its jurisdiction. (READ: Duterte throws out decade-long fight for the International Criminal Court) 
In December 2018, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor said it has “further closely followed relevant developments in the Philippines and will continue to do so.” – Rappler.com

True to the President's word, the ""war on drugs"" has been bloody more than 3 years into his administration.
Here are the numbers in the anti-illegal drug campaign according to the government, and from other sources that keep track of these statistics. 
This page will be updated regularly.
Noticeable is the huge disparity between official statistics and numbers cited by human rights groups that have contact with people on the ground.
Based on the government's official count through its #RealNumbersPH campaign, only 5,563 drug personalities have been killed in legitimate police operations as of December 31, 2019. Before that, however, on June 18, 2019, the Philippine National Police (PNP) itself reported a higher number: 6,600 drug suspects killed as of May 31, 2019.
Human rights organizations said that as of December 2018, the death toll could reach as high as 27,000, to include those killed outside police operations.
The PNP and the #RealNumbersPH campaign previously included statistics for ""deaths under investigation"" (DUI) or ""homicide cases under investigation"" (HCUI) which were broken down into 3 categories of cases: drug-related, non-drug-related, and those with motives still undetermined.
These HCUI figures are no longer included in the government's latest releases, with a presidential communications official explaining that they've decided on this to avoid these figures being ""mangled with other numbers.""
Based on data that Rappler obtained in June 2018, here’s a breakdown of HCUIs, as recorded by the PNP:
As of February 4, 2019, the PNP reported that there were at least 29,000 HCUIs, of which 3,062 were drug-related.
In March 2019, Rappler got updated data, showing that as of March 18, 2019, there have been a total of 30,145 homicide incidents or cases, but of the number, 11,098 were ""under investigation"" because the remaining 19,047 were tagged as ""cleared,"" with at least one suspect identified. The March 2019 data did not contain the 3 categories earlier listed for HCUIs.
[Editor's Note: Rappler previously reported at least 7,000 deaths in the #WarOnDrugs as of April 2017, based on figures from the PNP. Read our explanations on the changing figures here and here, as well as view a timeline of the PNP's use of the term ""deaths under investigation"".]
The government has also released the following statistics related to the drug war.
These were recorded from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 through its #RealNumbersPH campaign.
Anti-drug operations
High value targets arrested in anti-drug ops
Here’s a timeline of the changes in the government's manner of reporting its ""war on drugs"" statistics to the media since the start of the anti-drug campaign. 
As of 6 am of September 14, 2016, the number of suspects killed in police operations reached 1,506. But during a Senate probe on extrajudicial killings that day, then PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa said that after validation by its Directorate for Operations, the figure was corrected to only 1,105 deaths.
As of October 15, 2016, the number of policemen killed during operations stood at 13, while there were 40 wounded.
On October 19, 2016, deaths among police personnel rose to 15, while the number of wounded was revised to 36 after validation. The PNP broke down the casualties into drug-related and non-drug-related incidents, then reported only the drug-related casualties afterwards (7 dead, 24 wounded).
On October 26, 2016, the PNP launched Phase 2 of Oplan Double Barrel. After this, the statistics that the PNP started sending to media were ""reset"" to zero. However, on November 2, the PNP returned to its cumulative count from July 1.
On November 7, 2016, the PNP returned to reporting the total casualties, doing away with its categorization the month before. 
Police involvement in the ""war on drugs"" was temporarily suspended on January 30, 2017, when Duterte instructed the PNP to first rid its ranks of corrupt personnel. This was after some policemen reportedly got involved in the kidnap and murder of a South Korean businessman in October 2016. 
Weeks later, on February 27, 2017, the President allowed the PNP back into the ""war on drugs"" campaign, but with limited participation through smaller task forces.
On March 6, 2017, the PNP officially relaunched its participation in the ""war on drugs,"" in a campaign dubbed Oplan Double Barrel Alpha Reloaded.
The PNP initially started keeping track of Double Barrel Alpha Reloaded statistics from March 6, based on messages sent to the media. But in its data update on March 30, 2017, the PNP readjusted the start date earlier, to March 1.
Around March 2017, the PNP changed the term, ""deaths under investigation."" In a report that Rappler requested, the PNP used the term ""homicide cases under investigation"" or HCUI, which were further classified into 3 types of incidents: drug-related, non-drug-related, and those whose motives had yet to be determined.
On May 2, 2017, the government launched its #RealNumbersPH campaign, its new manner of disseminating statistics related to the ""war on drugs."" Compared to past media releases, it no longer included figures on the number of houses visited as part of Oplan TokHang.
Starting in its August 2017 update, the #RealNumbersPH social media graphics also no longer included the number of surrenderers.
In October 2017, the PNP's role in the ""war on drugs"" was suspended a second time, after President Duterte made the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) the sole agency in charge of the anti-illegal drug campaign. The PNP resumed providing active support to PDEA in December 2017.
The #RealNumbersPH figures that were released showed complete HCUI figures from March to June 2017 only. From January to March 2018, only drug-related homicide cases were announced. Since then, #RealNumbersPH figures totally excluded HCUI statistics.
In an August 17, 2018 press briefing on #RealNumbersPH, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Ana Marie Banaag explained that they stopped presenting HCUI figures because ""it gets mangled with other numbers; it gets confused with other numbers, so we chose not to.""
Banaag said, however, that HCUI figures can be requested from the PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM). – Rappler.com"

“Ay ko sunda, Tulisan ko (Don’t follow me, I’m a robber),"" said a cardboard sign hung over his neck.
The victim was identified as Dante Autero. According to Brigadier General Debold Sinas, director of the Police Regional Office 7, the victim was a “notorious” drug personality who had been in and out of prison.
Residents in the area told police they heard gunshots at around 3 am before his body was discovered hanging from the Mananga Bridge early morning.
The killing is reminiscent of the early days of the drug war from 2016 to 2017, when victims of extrajudicial killings were found with cardboard signs on their necks saying they were allegedly drug pushers or robbers, or otherwise guilty of committing other kinds of crimes.
Sinas said however that the doubts the Autero’s murder was the work of a vigilante group. “If it were vigilantes, they would have sent warnings ahead of time but there were none,” he told reporters.
This is the second killing in Metro Cebu in the span of 24 hours. Manuel Daposala, 46, was killed Sunday morning while buying water from an automatic dispenser on Cabantan Street in Cebu City, near the access road to the Cebu Business Park.
Two unidentified suspects shot him point blank in the neck and chest.
The United Nations recently passed a resolution, spearheaded by Iceland, to investigate the Philippines' war on drugs which has led to at least 6,000 suspected drug personalities killed in police operations. (READ: PH drug war killings reach 'threshold of crimes against humanity' – report)

Such allegations were hurled at Duterte even before his presidential candidacy. He, however, has constantly denied any involvement with the vigilante group, even challenging his critics to directly file a case against him. (READ: Duterte: ‘Am I the death squad? True’)
Duterte even pointed out, in one campaign sortie, that Senator and former justice secretary Leila de Lima failed to file a case against him.
As Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chairperson then, De Lima initiated a probe into the Davao City mayor’s involvement with the DDS, which has been accused of carrying out at least 1,000 summary killings.
In 2012, CHR released a resolution stating that it found “probable cause” and recommended that the Office of the Ombudsman investigate the “possible administrative and criminal liability” of Duterte in relation to the numerous killings under his watch as Davao City mayor.
Thursday, June 28, marks 6 years since the CHR resolution on the DDS was released. What has happened since?
In 2009, CHR conducted public hearings in Davao City on the killings between 2005 to 2009 attributed to the DDS.
It identified 206 deaths attributable to the DDS within this period – with 157 victims shot.
At least 107 victims between 2005 to 2009 had records or were suspected to have been involved in illegal activities. However, there were several instances of mistaken identity.
A report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in 2009 identified Jaypee Larosa as a victim of mistaken identity.
The 20-year-old was gunned down on July 17, 2008 by “three men in dark jackets who had arrived on a motorcycle"" while he was in a neighbor Internet cafe.
However, according to witnesses, one gunman was overheard saying in Filipino, “Son of a bitch, this is not the one.” Larosa, a young man with no criminal record and who lived in one of Davao City's quiet residential neighborhoods, was reportedly mistaken for a suspected robber.
The roster of victims also included minors, including 3 of Clarita Alia's 4 sons.
Alia narrated to HRW that her 4 sons – 18-year-old Richard, 17-year-old Christopher, 14-year-old Bobby, and 15-year-old Fernando – were killed one after another between July 2001 and April 2007.
CHR also found a “distinct pattern” of killings – victims “usually involved or suspected to have been involved” in illegal activities were gunned down by men riding motorcycles.
Despite this, Duterte denied that the killings were carried out by a particular group. He said that any government employee or military/police personnel involved were doing it on their own.
However, the use of .45 caliber handguns – which are “expensive” – was an indication of the “officially-sanctioned character of the killings,” according to the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions.
Despite constant denial and “dearth of evidence to support a finding of direct compliance,” the Commission pointed out the “systematic failure” of local government officials and police to conduct in-depth investigations into the local killings.
In fact, a senior police officer told CHR, only 24.59% percent of killings between January and August 2009 were “solved.”
The CHR resolution concluded that the local government is liable as it did not adopt reasonable measures despite knowledge of “a real and immediate threat.”
As the local chief executive and deputized National Police Commission (Napolcom) representative, Duterte “clearly disregarded” the information available on the killings committed in his jurisdiction.
“The continuing pattern of killings and the failure to conduct a meaningful investigation of such incidents can be construed as tolerance on the part of the authorities of the crimes, thereby contributing to the climate of impunity,” the CHR added.
As early as 2005, even the US embassy had taken notice of the rise of vigilante killings in several areas in the Philippines – specifically in Davao City and Cebu City. Based on what the embassy had heard, the report said the killings “seem very popular with the publics in Davao and Cebu.”
The report also said, “Mayors Duterte and [Tomas] Osmeña clearly condone the killings – which have not hurt their political standing in the slightest and apparently given them some bounce in popularity.”
The CHR came up with recommendations based on the results of its probe. However, 4 years on, little is known about what happened since.
The Office of the Ombudsman, according to the CHR in its resolution, should investigate the “possible administrative and criminal liability of Duterte for his inaction in the face of evidence of numerous killings committed in Davao City and his toleration of the commission of those offenses.”
Prior to the CHR resolution, the Office of the Ombudsman in March 2012 found 21 police officers guilty of simple neglect of duty in relation to the vigilante killings, recommending penalties ranging from one month suspension to a fine equivalent to a month's salary.
According to the Ombudsman, the ""unusually high number of unsolved killings"" was evidence that the local police force were ""remiss in their duty."" (READ: Ombudsman suspends cops for 'Davao Death Squad' killings)
However, in a statement released in 2015, HRW hit the Ombudsman for limiting its investigations to the police officers implicated ""and not Duterte himself.""
But according to a letter sent to CHR by the Office of the Ombudsman dated January 15, 2016 obtained by Rappler, the investigations on the DDS have been ""closed and terminated.""
The letter cited a fact-finding report dated May 5, 2014 submitted by the Field Investigation Office to Overall Deputy Ombudsman Arthur Carandang. The report quoted then CHR Region XI Director Alberto Sipaco Jr as saying that his office does not have any proof that the death squad does exist. The field investigation office also echoed Sipaco's statement that the allegations remain as ""chismis and other gossips.""
CHR Region XI covers Davao.
But in 2009, Sipaco, a member of Duterte's fraternity Lex Talionis, told then-United States ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenny that Duterte knew about the killings and permits them, according to a confidential cable published by WikiLeaks. (READ: Duterte 'admitted complicity' in Davao killings – WikiLeaks)
CHR recommended through the 2012 resolution the conduct of a “serious, impartial, and effective investigation” by several government agencies into the deaths attributed to the DDS to prosecute people responsible.
These investigations, the commission added, should include the “possible omissions, negligence, and obstructions of justice” done by the local government officials and police force.
In May 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that the probe had halted as the sole witness had left the government’s Witness Protection Program (WPP).
Outgoing justice secretary Emmanuel Caparas said “it’s very difficult to do anything” about the case unless the person resurfaced. (READ: DOJ halts probe into Davao Death Squad)
""It's very difficult to proceed on that basis,"" he said in a press conference in May. ""There are affidavits but if you want to confirm the affidavit, you have to talk to the witness. But the witness is not there.""
De Lima, meanwhile, said on May 22 that the witness had asked to leave the program when she stepped down from office in October 2015.
The decision of the witness, according to the senator, was “definitely in reaction to Duterte’s victory.”
Investigations into the existence of the Davao Death Squad took a new turn in 2016 with the confessions of two former alleged members.
The victims allegedly ordered killed by Duterte include broadcaster Jun Pala, bodyguards of ex-House speaker and then-mayoral candidate Prospero Nograles, a certain Sali Makdum, and Jun Barsabal, among others. (TIMELINE: Witness lists killings allegedly 'ordered by Duterte’)
Self-confessed hitman Edgar Matobato surfaced before a Senate hearing in September 2016 and accused Duterte and his son, Davao Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte of behind some of the killings carried out by the death squad. (READ: ‘Killed for no reason’: Matobato’s claims on the Davao Death Squad)
Retired Davao policeman Arturo ""Arthur"" Lascañas, meanwhile, did a 180-degree turn and retracted his previous denials. He corroborated earlier claims by Matobato on the involvement of Duterte in killings, adding that they received P20,000 to P100,000 per hit.
But the Senate hearings on these confessions resulted to nothing. According to senators, there are still no evidence pertaining to the existence of the DDS and Duterte's involvement, despite the other 4 witnesses who gave their testimonies in 2009. (READ: Lascañas, Matobato were not the first DDS whistle-blowers)
CHR, meanwhile, formed a new team to investigate the claims of Matobato and Lascañas. – Rappler.com

In one of the most scathing homilies against EJKs, David also questioned why the Philippine National Police (PNP) fails to catch these vigilantes, and also if the PNP has resolved even one of those they call ""deaths under investigation"" (DUIs). 
The bishop then prayed for the ""traitors and the new Judases of our country."" 
David recalled an earlier homily at the funeral of 19-year-old Raymart Siapo, a person with disability (PWD) who reportedly found himself on his community's drug watch list after a verbal tussle with his neighbor. 
Siapo eventually became one of the thousands of EJK victims in the Philippines. 
David addressed Siapo's killers in his funeral homily: ""Kung nakikinig kayo, ibig kong malaman ninyo na alam ng Diyos kung sino kayo. Hindi alam ng pulis, hindi alam ng barangay, hindi alam ng kapamilya ng biktima. Pero alam ng Diyos. Hindi ninyo maitatago sa Kanya ang mga pagmumukha ninyo, kahit mag-bonnet pa kayo. Kilala kayo ng Diyos.""
(If you are listening, I want you to know that God knows who you are. The police do not know, the village does not know, the relatives of the victim do not know. But God knows. You cannot hide from Him your faces, even if you wear bonnets. God knows you.)
""Nais kong malaman ninyo na ang pinatay ninyo ay hindi lang si Raymart kundi mga sarili ninyo, mga kaluluwa ninyo. Habambuhay kayong uusigin,"" David told Siapo's killers. ""Hindi kayo patatahimikin ng inyong mga konsensya, kung meron pang natitira. At hindi rin ako magugulat kung naririto rin sila ngayon, nakaupo at nagsisimba."" 
(I want you know that the person you killed is not only Raymart but yourselves, your souls. You will forever be haunted. Your conscience will not leave you in peace, if there's anything left of it. And I won't be surprised if they're also here right now, seated and hearing Mass.)
David also told vigilantes: ""Kung iniisip ninyo na ang ginagawa ninyo ay paglilingkod sa bayan, nagkakamali kayo. Hindi malulutas ng krimen ang mga kriminalidad."" (If you think that what you're doing is public service, you are wrong. Crime cannot solve criminality.)
'Walk for Life' in Navotas
David delivered his homily on Sunday as hundreds of Catholics joined a ""Walk for Life"" in Navotas City on the same day.
Mostly wearing white, the participants prayed the rosary while walking from one church to another – around one kilometer or 30 minutes, from San Ildefonso Parish to the Church of San Jose de Navotas – to pray for EJK victims in the Diocese of Kalookan. 
The Walk for Life was held around 5 am on Sunday, and was followed by a 6:15 am Mass presided over by David. The procession on Sunday was like the Walk for Life attended by around 10,000 people in Manila on February 18. 
David's jurisdiction, the Diocese of Kalookan, covers the cities of Caloocan (South), Malabon, and Navotas, known hotspots for drug-related killings.
David, 58, a leading Bible scholar educated in the Catholic University of Louvain, is one of the bishops most outspoken against EJKs in the Philippines. (READ: Impunity: The Church of the Resistance)
The brother of sociologist Randy David, he has been Kalookan bishop since January 2016. Before this, he served as auxiliary bishop of San Fernando, Pampanga, for nearly a decade.
'Termites' in society
In his homily on Sunday, David compared vigilantes to white termites who silently gnaw on wood from the inside, until all that remains is wooden skin.
He explained that termites would make it seem like the foundations of a house remain sturdy. ""Iyon pala parang sitsaron; wala nang laman sa loob, kinain na ng anay, at minsan bigla na lang mawawasak, guguho ang bahay."" (Then it turns out to be like pork cracklings; it is empty inside, eaten by termites, and sometimes will just collapse.)
""Ito ang mas nakakatakot at tunay na salot,"" the bishop said. ""Hindi lang mga bahay ang inaanay. Ang lipunan din."" (This is the real and more terrifying plague... Termites attack not only homes, but also society.)
David then cited vigilantes in the cities of Navotas, Caloocan, and Malabon, who kill people every day, ""like white termites who remain unseen.""
David questioned why police and village officials fail to catch these vigilantes, even if closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras can be found on every street. 
David said: ""'Yung mga simpleng pagnanakaw katulad nu'ng mga humahablot ng bag sa kalsada, madalas nakikita natin 'yan sa TV. Pero 'yung dumudukot ng tao sa harapan ng sariling mga anak at kapamilya, at pumapaslang sa kanila na walang kalaban-laban, sa ating mga purok, sa ating mga kalye, sa ating mga barangay, hindi sila nakikita. Bakit ba? Invisible ba sila?""
(Petty crimes, such as stealing a bag on the street, can often be seen on TV. But those who abduct people in front of their children and relatives, and kill them who are helpless, in our communities, our streets, our villages, cannot be seen. Why? Are they invisible?)
8 people killed in 5 minutes
On DUIs, David said, ""Gusto ko sanang malaman kung meron na bang nareresolba, kahit isa, sa mga death under investigation? Kahit isa lang."" (I just want to know if they have resolved even just one of these cases of deaths under investigation? Even just one.)
He pointed out that in cases of EJKs, police reports usually state that the victim is a ""drug suspect killed by unidentified hitmen.""
""Kapag tinatanong ko ang kapulisan tungkol sa mga pinapaslang ng mga bonnet gang, kadalasan sinasabi nila, 'Drug suspect talaga 'yon.' Matagal nang nasa drug watch list nila. Na parang ibig sabihin, case closed. Na para bang ibig sabihin, okay lang na pinatay sila dahil adik naman talaga o pusher talaga,"" he said.
(Whenever I ask policemen about those being killed by bonnet gangs, they often say, ""That's really a drug suspect."" They say he's really on their drug watch list. As if to say, case closed. As if to mean, it was okay to kill them because they're really addicts or pushers.)

David – who, in his smartphone, keeps a list of EJK victims – recalled specific cases of vigilante killings. 
One of these is the murder of the relatives and friends of Jay-R Santor, an alleged drug suspect. 
David said 4 of Santor's friends refused to reveal his whereabouts to vigilantes. All 4 of them ended up killed in front of Santor's house – Jonel Segovia, 15; Sonny Espinosa, 16; Angelito Soriano, 16; and Kenneth Lim, 20.
Inside Santor's house, he said vigilantes also massacred Santor's mother, Cristina; his brother, Ednel; and his pregnant sister, Analyn.
""Sa loob ng 5 minuto, 8 ang napatay nila, kasama na ang sanggol sa tiyan ni Analyn. Pero ang talagang hinahanap nila ay hindi nila natagpuan doon,"" David said. (In 5 minutes, they killed 8 people, including the baby in the womb of Analyn. But they failed to find the one they were really looking for.)
""Pagkatapos ng 3 araw, lumabas sa balita, Jay-R Santor, napaslang. Nahanap na rin nila. Pero ubos ang buong pamilya ni Jay-R Santor,"" he added. (After 3 days, the news said Jay-R Santor was killed. They were able to find him. But Jay-R Santor's family was also wiped out.)
'New Judases'
David closed his homily with a prayer, asking God's forgiveness for all these sins.
""Salamat sa biyaya ng Eukaristiya, sa biyaya ng patawad at kaligtasan, pati na sa mga traydor at mga bagong Hudas sa aming bayan,"" he said. (Thank you for the gift of the Eucharist, for the gifts of forgiveness and salvation, even for the traitors and new Judases in our country.)
For many Catholics who joined the mass for EJK victims, however, the ""termites"" appeared to have made their presence felt during Sunday's Mass.
At around 4:30 am on Sunday – or 30 minutes before the Walk for Life began – members of the San Jose de Navotas Parish learned that there was no electricity in their church.
Aurora Santiago, president of the Council of the Laity of the Diocese of Kalookan, said there was electricity in the priest's residence and the nearby school, and the outage curiously affected only the church building itself.
David said Mass using only a generator connected to either the priest's residence or the nearby school.
""Hindi ho namin maintindihan kung bakit walang kuryente dito lang sa simbahan. May kuryente ho sa buong Navotas, pero dito lang sa simbahan, biglang nawala,"" David said at the start of his homily.
(We can't understand why there's no power only here in church. There's power in the whole of Navotas, but it is gone only here.)
""Ewan ko lang kung bakit nangyayari ang mga bagay-bagay na ito. Parang may ibig pumigil sa ating dapat gawin ngayong umaga (I don't know why things like this are happening. It seems like some people want to stop us from achieving our goals this morning),"" David said, as ""termites"" continue to roam the country. – Rappler.com

Yap, who was Escalante City mayor when the attacks took place, faces trial for 4 counts of murder and one count of frustrated murder, the Ombudsman said in a statement on Thursday, July 14.
Charged with Yap are Richard Patpat, Rolando Catayan, Joel Villarin, Jay Vargas, JR Buhat, Gregory Tuayon, Bernardino Patigas, Hernando Llorente, Rolando Llamata, Lorenzo Perolino, Joey Llorente, Eleazar Navas, and 3 others known only by their aliases – Renan, Bam-Bam, and Bob Soler.
The Ombudsman said its investigation showed that the 5 victims were known supporters of Yap’s former political opponent.
Sun.Star Bacolod reported in June that the victims in the murders cases are Ferjun Damalerio, Armando Lutrago, Eric Matugas and Jury Alsado Sr; and Fernando Damalerio, the victim in the frustrated murder case – all supporters of former Escalante mayor Santiago Barcelona Jr.
The New People’s Army had claimed responsibility for the attacks on Barcelona’s supporters but the Ombudsman, in its consolidated resolution, gave credence to the testimonies of witnesses who cited Yap’s close links with the group.
According to the Ombudsman's press statement, “the witnesses disclosed that Yap supplied the CPP-NPA Command of its logistical needs and alleged that Yap exercised considerable influence over the Command.”
“The sworn statement [by witnesses] is given the presumption of credibility absent any showing that they are motivated by ill-will,” the resolution said.
“This Office is inclined to believe that that motive for these crimes were political,” said Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales.
Yap served as Escalante mayor from 2007 to 2016, before he won as Negros Occidental First District representative. 
In 2011, the National Police Commission stripped Yap of his supervisory power over the local police over allegations that he was sympathetic to the NPA, and the continuing extrajudicial killings in Escalante. 
In April 2013, families of victims of extrajudicial killings in Escalante filed murder and frustrated murder complaints against the then mayor and several others before the city prosecutor’s office. – Rappler.com"

PNP spokesperson Chief Superintendent Dionardo Carlos issued the statement late Friday afternoon to correct an announcement he had made hours earlier – that there has been only one case of extrajudicial killing since Duterte became president.
""The PNP protects every individual's right to life. To allay or remove their fear of becoming victims of EJK, let it be known that under the present administration, there is only one case of extra-judicial killing or EJK for the period July 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017,"" Carlos said in his text message to reporters past 10 am on Friday.
The PNP spokesperson made the statement in response to the results of the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey which showed that 7 in 10 Filipinos fear that they may become victims of extrajudicial killings.
Carlos initially said the only extrajudicial killing the PNP recognizes is the case of slain journalist Larry Que in Catanduanes.
Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua, and Police Officer 1 Vincent Tacorda, the whistleblower cop who claimed he can no longer stomach illegal activities in their police force, had been implicated in Que's case. (READ: The tangled web in publisher Larry Que's slay case)
While Tacorda had recanted his statement, Carlos said at first that Que's case was still considered as extrajudicial killing.  ""Tacorda retracted his statement but Que is still dead, so the case still stands,"" Carlos initially said.
Hours later, Carlos sent another statement to the media correcting his earlier figure, after the task force  in charge of cases of killings of media people and political activists pointed out his ""mistake.""
""I was corrected by TF Usig that the Larry Que case is not a confirmed EJK case. so officially, no case..... I stand corrected,"" the PNP spokesperson said in his text message sent past 4 pm.
Definition
While the PNP does not recognize any cases of extrajudicial killing under the Duterte administration, the PNP counts at least 3,850 drug suspects killed in their anti-drug operations, and at least 2,290 killed for drug-related motives, mostly slain by unidentified assailants.
Some cops, particularly from Caloocan City, had also come under fire for the killings of teenagers Kian delos Santos and Carl Arnaiz. 
Carlos clarified that the PNP uses the definition of extrajudicial killing as provided  under Administrative Order 35 issued by the Aquino administration.
Under the order, extrajudicial killings are defined as committed by ""state and non-state forces"" to silence, ""through violence and intimidation, legitimate dissent and opposition raised by members of the civil society, cause-oriented groups, political movements, people’s and non-governmental organizations, and by ordinary citizens."" 
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Saturday, October 7, that while they are confined to the definition as stated under AO 35, the government recognizes that ""one death is one too many.""
""We wish to emphasize that one death is one too many. Regardless of  this definition, these deaths are being addressed to ensure the accountability of perpetrators, even as it calls upon witnesses and individuals who can provide valuable evidence that will lead to speedy resolution of cases,"" Abella said.
Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano used the same definition when he made a presentation to the United Nations Human Rights Council in May, and maintained that there was no new wave of killings in the Philippines under Duterte. (READ: CHR refutes Cayetano: We did not change definition of EJKs)
According to the international definition, an extrajudicial killing is an execution done by government actors without going through the legal process. – Rappler.com

SWS did survey wrong, says PNP",,"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) believes that the survey on the perception of extrajudicial killings (EJK) in the country was incorrectly done by polling firm Social Weather Stations (SWS).
""I don't want to dispute the statistics derived from SWS except there is something amiss with how the questions are framed in relation to the perception [of] the alleged police involvement in illegal drugs and alleged EJK,"" PNP chief Director General Oscar Albayalde read from a prepared statement in a Camp Crame briefing on Monday, March 4.
In a survey conducted from December 16 to 19, 2018, the SWS found that 78%, or almost 4 out of 5 Filipinos, are worried that they, or someone they know, will be a victim of EJK amid the administration's relentless campaign against illegal drugs.
According to the police chief, the question of the SWS was leading, and bound to evoke fear from respondents because of its phrasing, ""How worried are you that you or anyone you know will be a victim of 'extrajudicial killing’ or EJK?""
""Mali naman kaagad na 'Gaano kayo nangangamba.' Everyone will be scared of course, sino ba ang 'di takot mamatay, sino ba ang 'di takot mabiktima ng krimen?"" Albayalde said. (It is wrong that you start with ""How worried are you."" Everyone will be scared, of course. Who is not afraid of dying? Who is not afraid of being victimized by crime?)
Albayalde added that the SWS should have ""provided a briefing to define EJK.""
How is EJK defined? The PNP definition of EJK follows Administrative Order 35 of the Aquino administration.
The order defines EJKs as committed by ""state and non-state forces"" to silence, ""through violence and intimidation, legitimate dissent and opposition raised by members of the civil society, cause-oriented groups, political movements, people’s and non-governmental organizations, and by ordinary citizens.""
However, there is a new definition of EJK that bolsters the high number of claims of human rights advocates. Newly-signed Republic Act No 11188 or the Act for Special Protection of Children in Situations of Armed Conflict defines EJK as follows:
""Extrajudicial killings refer to all acts and omissions of State actors that constitute violation of the general recognition of the right to life embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UNCRC and similar other human rights treaties to which the Philippines is a state party."" – Rappler.com

BACOLOD CITY, Philippines - Families of the victims of extrajudicial killings in Escalante City, Negros Occidental called on President Benigno Aquino anew to act on the killings.
About 8,000 residents joined a rally on Saturday, April 20, to demand justice for the victims of extrajudicial killings in the city since 2007.
According to Luke Espiritu, counsel of the victims, such killings have claimed 25 lives in the city.
Tessie Villadar Damalerio, whose son and brother were among victims, said President Aquino and Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas should immediately act on the findings of Task Force Escalante, the body that investigated the deaths.The report of Task Force Escalante was submitted to the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) last year.
""Do we have to wait for another killing to take place before you act?"" Damalerio asked.
Police records showed that majority of killings in Escalante, the most recent being the assassination of Police Officer 1 Beijen Tanguan and police asset Joseph Lutrago, were perpetrated by the New People’s Army (NPA).Lutrago's brother, Jonathan, who also participated in the rally, claimed that NPA rebels behind the killings are in the payroll of a politician.Peace advocates in the province also expressed dismay, saying authorities have forgotten the cases. 
Impunity
Espiritu said the culture of impunity in Escalante is too much already. “The government has to intervene now, replace the policemen and place Escalante under Comelec control,” he added.The call to place the city under Comelec control is being supported by re-electionist governor Alfredo Marañon Jr. and Escalante mayoral candidate Santiago Barcelona, who were both present in the rally.Barcelona, who is running against reelectionist mayor Melecio Yap, said 18 of the 25 victims of extrajudicial killings in the city were his supporters.
A former mayor himself, Barcelona lost to Yap in the 2010 mayoral race. His wife, Alice, also lost to Yap in the 2007 elections.
Yap and 8 others, including a retired Army major and a former policeman, were charged last week for 3 counts of murder and two counts of frustrated murder in connection with the spate of killings in the city.
Another rally
On the other hand, supporters of Yap also held on Saturday a prayer rally, just 250 meters away from the rally attended by Marañon and Barcelona.

Yap said he welcomes the charges filed against him. He said he wants to clear his name in the proper forum. At the same time, Yap also warned he would file counter-charges against those who he said fabricated lies about him.His lawyer, Dan Pondevilla, questioned the motive for the filing of charges against Yap. ""Why only now, when the election is about to happen?""
Pondevilla added the claims have no basis, and that many killings have already been solved and suspects were charged in court.
Yap also dismissed Marañon's previous comment describing the killings in Escalante as worse than the Maguindanao massacre. The reelectionist mayor said the statement is “unfair to Escalantehanons.”""Why is he (Governor Marañon) frequently visiting Escalante, if the place is not peaceful? It is because he is afraid to lose,"" he added.In 2011, Yap was stripped of his supervisory power over the local police following allegations that he was sympathetic to the NPA, and because of the killings in the city.
Escalante falls under Category 1 of the Comelec watchlist due to the employment of private armed groups by candidates and intense political rivalries. - Rappler.com"

The PDEA’s latest count, from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2019, showed that lives of 5,526 people were claimed in the course of 134,583 anti-drug operations by the government, while 193,086 drug personalities were arrested in that period. Majority of the operations were carried out by the Philippine National Police (PNP).
The PDEA's findings are part of #RealNumbersPH, the government's effort to counter what it called a ""false narrative"" on the war on drugs.
Outside the PDEA's count, rights groups estimate the drug war to have claimed as much as 27,000 lives, including the victims of vigilante-style killings. (READ: PH drug war killings reach 'threshold of crimes against humanity' – report)
PDEA's latest data showed a continuous climb in the number of deaths, with an additional 476 kills since the end of 2018. Prior to this, the government recorded 5,050 suspects killed in anti-drug operations as of November 30, 2018. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Along with the high death toll, the government also reported 7,054 ""high value targets"" and 681 government workers were arrested in anti-drug operations. Among the government workers were 323 government employees, 282 elected officials, and 76 uniformed personnel.
Aside from this, the Philippine National Police said 2,367 cops have been dismissed from service as part of its internal cleansing program.
Halfway mark: In the previous SONA, Duterte vowed his drug war would not be sidelined as he dismissed international criticism over his campaign. The President vowed his anti-drug campaign would be ""as chilling as on the day it began.""
Duterte amped up his actions by releasing a list tagging politicians of supposedly being involved in illegal drug operations just weeks before the 2019 midterm elections held last May.
Meanwhile, glaring gaps in the government's anti-drug campaign have prompted certain sectors to question the operation before the Supreme Court. The petitioners were asking the High Court to declare as unconstitutional the anti-drugs campaign.
In April 2019, the High Court ordered the release of thousands of drug war documents, despite efforts to block it by the Solicitor General.
Recently, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in July 2019 adopted a resolution to look into drug war killings in the Philippines. It tasked the UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to write a comprehensive report on the situation in the Philippines and present this to the council. (READ: U.N. rights chief: Deaths in PH anti-drug operations a ‘most serious concern’)
Malacañang, though, has so far shown no signs it would cooperate with the completion of the comprehesive report, instead calling it an ""insult"" to Filipinos. (READ: On U.N. resolution vs drug war killings: What if Duterte blocks review?) 
Not yet over: Despite this, the government has claimed the drug war is far from over with officials tagging it as a ""protective measure"" for ""law-abiding citizens"" against supposed errant drug users.
It claimed 13,753 of the 42,045 total barangays have been cleared since June 2019. This leaves 19,215 that have yet to be ""cleared.""
This is an additional 3,754 barangays cleared since the start of the year. Prior to this, PDEA reported 9,999 barangays were cleared as of December 31, 2018. – Rappler.com

Nanette Castillo has felt it. It has numbed her. On October 2, 2017, she lost her son Aldrin, who was shot to death by unidentified men on motorcycles just across their house on Herbosa Street, Tondo, Manila. 
Nanette slumped beside him on the street, feeling every last bit of warmth escaping his body before it was taken by funeral workers. She was hysterical – cursing the cops who did not bother to call an ambulance, even hastily blaming her daughter for asking Aldrin to come to their home in Tondo in the first place. 
“I knew he was dead, but I still wanted to bring him to the hospital. I was hysterical. I screamed at the police – you sons of bitches, are you God?"" she recalled in Filipino.
On Wednesday, March 7, Nanette counted it as the 157th day since that gruesome night. She counts every single day without Aldrin, describing each day without him ""only heavier than the day before.""
She spoke before lawyers and law students at ""Rise, Resist, Unite against Tokhang and Tyranny,” a forum on the human rights implications of President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, organized by a new network of lawyers, Mga Manananggol Laban sa EJK or MANLABAN sa EJK.
Many have told Nanette that it was futile to pursue a case against Aldrin’s killers, who have remained unidentified to this day. But she is hopeful, even confident, that there is more to this catharsis than just grieving and letting go. 
She is not afraid to admit that Aldrin used drugs. Not once had he been involved in trouble anyway, she said. Aldrin is neither listed in the barangay watch list nor does he have any criminal records in the Manila Police District. 
In fact, the 32-year old bachelor was supposed to go to Saudi Arabia to work as a professional welder had he not been killed. Both unemployed, Nanette and her husband relied mostly on Aldrin's support. “He was never a burden to us,” Nanette said. “Maybe in the eyes of Duterte he is a plague, but to us, Duterte is the plague."" 
Speak for other women

While Nanette is far from finding justice for Aldrin, she remains vocal about her story of victimization, especially after working with faith-based group Rise Up for Life and for Rights. 
She tells Rappler speaking out is the least she could do for her son. But, more importantly, she says she speaks on behalf of those who cannot, or who would not, speak.  
“Other victims are scared,” Nanette said. “I want them to be empowered, I want mothers to be enlightened. You have to stand up because you are victims, you have nothing to be afraid of. And even if you aren’t victims, you should speak up.”
Indeed, Nanette is but one of the thousands of women who are left to “claw their way out of bereavement, anger, marginalization, and poverty.” 
In the same forum, National Union of Peoples Lawyers (NUPL) chairman Neri Colmenares spoke about this particular issue, suffering women who are mostly alone. 
“For every tokhang victim, there is a woman wailing beside,” Colmenares said. “Out there are ten thousand mothers who have borne the personal brunt of the loss of a husband or a child."" 
“It’s the women who will be picking up the breadwinner's mantle and teaching the children how to cope with grief and anger, with dignity and honor. It will take feisty and consistent female courage to take this administration, and perpetrators and enablers, to account,” he added.
Nanette seems to be an exception to this statement, as she does not need much courage to do what she does. She tells herself she’s gone through the worst. “What do I have to be afraid of, when I’ve already lost my son?"" 
“This is why you can’t bully me, Duterte. I cannot be bullied” Nanette said.  
Fight like a woman
But with thousands of mothers and daughters left behind, there are only few like Nanette who could face the camera to speak out against the killings. 
Angela (not her real name), a mother like Nanette, opts to go a different way – the legal way.
Unlike Nanette, Angela is certain that cops are responsible for her son’s death because he was arrested at a checkpoint a few days before he was found dead in a morgue in Manila. 
Confident that her son was innocent, Angela found herself investigating the case, finding links to clarify the puzzling death of her son. 
She fought hard to get copies of police reports and CCTV footage, even if it meant sending out 60 letters of request. 
She was determined to pursue her fight, but she questioned herself: “How do I defend my son who did not even do anything wrong?”
Angela is now represented by the NUPL, specifically Attorney Krissy Conti, who has been involved in cases of extrajudicial killings related to the drug war.
As a woman herself, Conti says it has been easier for mothers to connect and share their stories to her, knowing full well that there is a common understanding between women. 
“The female factor is the trust given to you by mothers because they know you can relate – which I dont see with their relations with male lawyers. They are stiff and formal with male lawyers, but with women lawyers they are relaxed,” Conti said. 
Conti said she understands the plight of these women, knowing that it is most painful for any parent to predecease a child. This is why women will be the ""moving force"" of this fight against extrajudicial killings, she said. 
Conti said it would be a challenge for women, however, to communicate their issues to the sexist President Duterte. She wonders how Duterte would deal with the issue of so many wailing women who will come to him. 
“He doesn't listen because he's a populist, and we only have one, two, three [women speaking out]. If 5,000, 10,000 women would pester him, things might change,” Conti said in Filipino.
With more and more women victimized by Duterte’s war on drugs, Conti said there is a need to double the effort women to come together. “Mothers and daughters share empathy differently,” she said. 
To organize, Conti and her fellow advocates against EJKs coined the term “WoManlaban” to engrave what it means for every woman to fight in this war on drugs. It also a play on the word ""nanlaban"" (fought back), the reason almost always cited by cops for killing drug suspects. 
Women hold families together, Conti said, so it will be inevitable for other members of the family to join their mothers or sisters in this fight.
""To WoManlaban, you bring in your entire family into your struggle as well,” Conti said. “When a woman fights, she fights not only for herself but for others, and she brings in others into the fight as well."" – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippine – An activist priest found himself the target of a death squad he closely followed and documented most of his life. 
In a blog post on Sunday, August 26, Father Amado Picardal narrated how the threats he had gotten for years materialized in the last few months as he lived “a quiet life as a hermit” in Southern Philippines. 
“Two weeks ago, I almost became a victim of extrajudicial killing and the 4th priest to be killed under the Duterte regime had I stuck to my routine,” he wrote. 
Picardal said he got information that on the afternoon of August 11, about 6 men on board 3 motorcycles “with full-faced helmets” stationed themselves near the entrance of the monastery he frequented in Cebu. It was usually the time he would go out, following his usual routine. 
“Had I gone out, there would have been no escape for me,” he wrote. “I recognized their modus operandi – that’s what I learned from a former member of the Davao Death Squad when we were documenting the extrajudicial killings years before.”  
“It was a close call, I thank God for protecting me,” the priest added.  
Three Catholic priests have been killed under President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. (READ: More Catholics outraged by killings of priests) 
Father Richmond Nilo, a 43-year-old priest in Nueva Ecija, was killed last June 2018. Murdered before him were Father Marcelito Paez, a 72-year-old priest also from Nueva Ecija, and 37-year-old Father Mark Ventura of Cagayan. 
Just last July, a gunman was killed in a shootout outside the Archbishop's Residence in Cebu City. He was allegedly looking for Archbishop Jose Palma. 
Years fighting the DDS
Picardal’s work involving the call for justice for victims of extrajudicial killings may have been the reason for his being targeted. 
As part of the Coalition Against Summary Executions (Case), Picardal was able to document the killings allegedly carried out by the Davao Death Squad (DDS) when Rodrigo Duterte was mayor. He was based in Davao City from 1977 to 1981 and from 1995 to 2011. 
The DDS is claimed to be responsible for the deaths of at least 1,000 people. The group was allegedly overseen by then mayor Duterte, according to several whistleblowers. He, however, has denied this.
FOR LIFE AND PEACE. Father Amado Picardal dedicates his life to seeking justice for victims of extrajudicial killings.
Photo from his blog
Picardal was among the main sources of several groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW), as they reported on these extrajudicial killings. (READ: What ever happened to the Davao Death Squad investigations?)
The priest, however, is not sure who ordered his hit – whether it was the President himself or “some zealous henchman trying to please him” – as all he knows is that a death squad is determined to kill him. 
“Whatever happens  to me – whether the order came from him or not – the blame will be placed on him for under this regime the culture of death has claimed the lives of over 25,000 people,” Picardal wrote. 
“This regime has nothing to gain in creating a martyr so those behind the project should think twice before carrying out their evil plan,” he added.
Hermit life on hold
As several priests and staff of the monastery have noticed that the unidentified men still lingered for several days after August 11, Picardal was advised to “move to a more secure location and avoid public exposure.” 
He, however, wrote he “always knew"" his ""life would be at risk” but that he would not make himself an easy target. 
“I have decided to temporarily vacate my hermitage up in the mountain and continue to spend my life of silence, solitude, prayer and writing in a more secure location,” Picardal wrote, adding that he hopes to go back to the mountains soon. 
In March 2018, Picardal embarked on what he called the last phase of his life which includes “a life of solitude, silence, and prayer” as a hermit in the mountains. 
His hermitage plans have been temporarily put on hold as the threats against his life mount, he wrote. (READ: One last bike trip for the fearless Father Picx) – Rappler.com

""Maraming namatay dito, totoo 'yan, but prove na ako ang pumatay at kung sino,"" said Duterte on Tuesday, September 20, during an event in Davao City.
Though he did not name De Lima explicitly, he spoke of a ""Delilah,"" a nickname he has used before to refer to her.
""Si Delilah, 1,000. Sabihin ko sa kanya (I'll tell her), name the 10th victim. Isang question ko lang (I just have one question): so there have been about 500, who was the guy, the 500th who was killed and on what day and how it was done?"" said Duterte.
The President even invited witnesses to go to Davao City so he can cross-examine them.
""Pumunta sila dito, ako ang mag cross-examine sa kanila (They go here so I can cross-examine them). Who was the first victim? Who was the second? What was the name? Where did it happen?"" he said.
Fault of 'enemies'
Duterte claimed his ""enemies"" in Davao City are responsible for portraying him as behind the extrajudicial killings.
""Meron dito, mga kalaban ko for whatever reason – kung sino pumatay, it does not really matter – kukunan ng picture and then it was made into a folder with so many folders there, victims of crimes against persons, nasali lahat doon,"" he said.
(Here I have enemies who, for whatever reason – it does not really matter who killed them – they will take a picture of the body and then it was made into a folder, victims of crimes against persons, all were included there.)
Duterte said he chose to respond to these past accusations with sarcasm.
""'Napaka gago naman ninyo. Eh kung talagang killer ako, I've been mayor here 23 years, 'yan lang ipakita ninyo sa akin? Karami kong tinapon diyan sa Samal Island na Davao Gulf 'yan lang nakita mo?' I raised it to the level of sarcasm,"" he said.
('You are insane. If I were really a killer, I've been mayor here for 23 years, that's all you can show? I've dumped so many bodies in Samal Island, Davao Gulf.' I raised it to the level of sarcasm.)
But Duterte admitted he has ordered the deaths of certain criminals. Previously, he had already admitted to ordering that criminals be shot if they posed a threat to law enforcers.
""Sinabi ko, umalis kayo dito if you're into drugs, murder for hire. Umalis kayo kasi 'pag hindi, papatayin ko kayo and in the process marami akong pinatay upon my direction, walang problema 'yan,"" he said.
(I said, get out if you're into drugs, murder for hire. Get out because if you don't, I'll kill you and in the process I had many killed, no problem there.)
Just threats?
Duterte also cautioned people from equating his colorful threats against criminals to actual acts of extrajudicial executions.
Specifically, he criticized members of the European Parliament for using his threats as proof that he is behind the recent spate of extrajudicial killings.
""Putang ina ka, istorya mo lang 'yan. Kung ginawa ko, ibang storya 'yan,"" he said. (Son of a whore, that's just your story. If I really did it, that's another story.)
Simply threatening criminals is not a crime, Duterte added.
""Look at these idiots, they’re using a phrase, a narrative of my speeches before threatening criminals. Now let me ask you stupid lawyers of the other countries, is there a law in the Philippines that would make it illegal for a mayor, president, or governor to threaten criminals?"" he said.
Duterte chose to issue his challenge to De Lima the day after she was ousted as chair of the Senate committee on justice. As such, she will not be presiding over future hearings on extrajudicial killings.
Senators who voted to oust her said she was too ""anti-administration"", thus supposedly compromising the impartiality of the investigation.
Senator Richard Gordon, the new justice committee chairperson, has promised an objective investigation.
Duterte's challenge also comes on the first day of a House probe into De Lima's alleged involvement in the Bilibid prison drug trade. De Lima claimed the probe, launched by Duterte's allies in the House, is meant to discredit her. – Rappler.com

Police Officer 2 Jhaymar Espedido, Senior Police Officer 4 Wilson Villegas, Senior Police Officer 3 Noel Malabayabas, and Senior Police Officer 2 Bryan Nobo of the Agdangan Police in Quezon face a complaint of frustrated murder filed at the Office of the Ombudsman Thursday, November 29.
The 4 cops also face complaints of grave misconduct and grave irregularity in the performance of duty, while their station chief, Inspector Wilson Mansion, was filed with a complaint for gross neglect of duty.
Roger Herrero, who was shot in the head and sustained a broken jaw, is recuperating at the hospital. An online fundraising initiative by journalist Ezra Acayan gathered donations to help Herrero with hospital bills. 
The complaint
According to the National Bureau of Investigation, “claims and facts” by the policemen “do not jibe” with current evidence.
The policemen claimed that they were responding to a distress call evening of November 1 by a certain Rommel Supilinas, who claimed Herrero robbed him at gunpoint.
The policemen said they hunted down the suspect – Herrero – but that the victim fired his gun first. Herrero, who the cops said fled towards the bushes, allegedly engaged the cops in a firefight. Herrero would be found later in a hospital in nearby Atimonan town.
Supilinas, however, did not show up for NBI questioning.
Residents of Barangay Binagbag, where the alleged gunfight happened, told the NBI that “no firefight occurred in their area, much less heard gunshots on the night of November 1.""
A barangay official was named as a witness for a certificate of inventory which states a .38 caliber revolver was found by the police, but the NBI said the certificate was not signed by the issuing person.
Victim’s version
The complaint to the NBI was filed by Herrero’s common-law wife and his sister.
According to them, Herrero said he was asked by a friend named Franklin Pareja to meet and go to the barrio of Laboy. When they got there, Herrero said Pareja ran off, leaving him to be picked up by men on board a car.
Herrero said he was immediately handcuffed, and that he recognized his abductors as policemen from their town. He heard one cop called by the name “Sir Espidido” later identified as Police Office 2 Jhaymar Espedido.
Herrero said he was interrogated by cops on alleged robberies.
“After hearing the abductors say that Pareja had admitted to them his involvement in crimes, he thought it best to admit his involvement with Pareja. He then realized that Pareja had betrayed him,” the NBI said in its complaint to the Ombudsman.
Herrero said when they reached a bridge in Atimonan, they all got off the car where the cops led him to a grassy portion of the road. Herrero said the cops told him to start praying.
“Sensing that something bad will be done unto him, he pleaded that his life be spared for the sake of his young children, but as it is, he was shot in the head close range. He dropped to the ground and was left for dead,” the NBI said.
Herrero regained consciousness and managed to walk until a group of young men took him to a nearby hospital. Thinking he would soon die, he wrote “Sir Spidido” on a piece of paper and the word “salvaging” (a term that had been used in the Philippines as execution) and penned goodbye to his wife and sister.
Giving merit to the testimonies of witnesses and Herrero, the NBI said “absent any evidence showing any reason or motive for complainant and witnesses to perjure, the logical conclusion is that no such improver motive exists.”
The complaint was filed on the same day that the Caloocan Regional Trial Court convicted local policemen of murder for shooting a 17-year-old boy they claimed was involved in drugs. The teen, Kian Delos Santos, did not survive. – Rappler.com

Practically every day for the most part of the year, TV footage, online posts, and newspaper photos showed blood and grief as policemen raided poor villages and shanties to implement the Duterte administration's war on drugs. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Despite official data and eyewitness accounts, the government has repeatedly denied that the dead are victims of extrajudicial killings.
This state of denial has come in many forms, such as official declarations – like the one made before the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in September – that the deaths from police operations ""are not extrajudicial killings""; the rejection of calls by United Nations member-states to conduct a thorough and impartial probe; and the intimidation of local and foreign human rights advocates.
At the slightest hint of intending to investigate the drug war, international organizations and personalities were demonized by President Rodrigo Duterte. He cursed and threatened to slap United Nations Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard and warned to put on the immigration blacklist US lawmakers who have been pushing for an independent probe into alleged police abuses.
The government also declared it would reject aid from nations that have expressed concern over the killings. 
Parallel to these frontal attacks were diplomatic efforts made by Duterte's advisers, such as Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano and Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
Before state-parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC), where a Filipino lawyer filed a ""communication"" against Duterte, Roque said that the administration would ""reassess"" its commitment to it should the court violate the principle of complementarity enshrined in its founding treaty. (The principle requires the ICC to step in only if it's been proven that a concerned country has not been willing to act on the issues hurled against it.)
Government officials have also issued broad commitments to bring to court anyone found to violate criminal laws.
Denial's consequences
Latest government numbers show that 3,993 suspected drug personalities were killed in police anti-drug operations since Duterte became president in June 2016. Families of victims said policemen shot defenseless suspects. (READ: The Fifth Man)
Ellecer Carlos of the In Defense of Human Rights and Dignity Movement (iDEFEND) said the administration's dismissal of any human rights probe is proof that it won't ""accept any interference.” But this has consequences, he said.
Carlos noted that aid-giving states have ""considerations that will always depend on how the government treats its most vulnerable, how it respects, protects and fulfills human rights."" He added, ""There will be states which may now think twice about providing support to the Philippine National Police because they know that the funding will just go to waste.”  
As signatory to various international human rights treaties, the government is “duty-bound” to follow the guidelines and implement appropriate measures to investigate and prosecute those responsible, he said.
Non-acceptance of the criticisms and recommendations by other countries regarding the human rights situation “does not relieve the government at all of its obligations and accountability before the community of nations,” according to lawyer Perfecto Caparas. 
 “At all times, government remains to be the duty-bearer primarily responsible to respect, protect and fulfill all the economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights of all people, who are the rights-holders,” he added. 
No to executive branch's investigation
Human rights groups and advocates said the situation calls for investigation by parties outside the executive branch of government. (READ: Supreme Court asked to order probe into all EJK cases)
Yet, the local constitutional body tasked to protect human rights and prevent its abuse, has also been emasculated. The Commission on Human Rights is barred from accessing important legal documents such as case folders of drug war deaths. 
Outside the Philippines, the UN has various mechanisms and tools to hold countries and leaders accountable. 
The UN Human Rights Council can unilaterally begin its own investigation of the reported extrajudicial killings here, according to John Fisher, director of Human Rights Watch Geneva, citing the example of Myanmar and the prosecution of the Rohingya Muslims there. 
“One way or another, there needs to be an investigation, there needs to be accountability and if the government is sincere in saying that it is open to that kind of scrutiny, then we expect them to be open to that kind of probe,” Fisher said.  
He expressed the hope that the government would eventually cooperate with an international team – should the time come. (READ: No extrajudicial killings in PH? World 'not fooled,' says HRW)
“If the government claims that they are not doing anything, why would they not want to cooperate?” Fisher said. “The fact that they have been so resistant to independent scrutiny suggests that they are well aware that the killings of the so-called war on drugs are in violation of international standards and that in fact don't want what's happening to come to life,” he added.
What local groups can do 
Carlos said that any move by UN agencies and experts is “very dependent” on the activities of human rights groups in the Philippines. (READ: 'Demonizing' human rights in the first year of Duterte)
These local groups have been the center of Duterte’s tirades. He has threatened to shoot advocates if they “obstruct justice” even as rabid supporters called for their death. “The government fostered systemic impunity and engendered routine disregard for the rule of law makes the work for human rights defenders very challenging and risky,” Carlos said. 
While it is a tiring and taxing battle, the human rights campaign compels groups involved to exhaust all legall means to exact accountability from public institutions and officials.
If these means are exhausted and impunity persists, then this would be a ""key requirement for various international mechanisms to kick in,” Carlos said.
One example of an international mechanism is the ICC, which can try Duterte over crimes against humanity or “serious violations committed as part of a large-scale attack against any civilian population.”
In April 2017, lawyer Jude Sabio filed with the ICC a 78-page “communication” entitled, ""The Situation of Mass Murder in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte: The Mass Murderer.” Additional documents were filed by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano.
The filing is just the first step as  the Office of the Prosecutor still has to decide whether the complaint has basis. (READ: What challenges will complaint vs Duterte face before ICC?) 
But the ""decisive arena” of the human rights struggle is in the domestic front, Caparas stressed. “Surely, our people will continue defending the democratic space we still have at the moment,"" he said. – Rappler.com

Detained opposition senator Leila de Lima said she wants an end to the extrajudicial killings under President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody drug war, which has killed thousands.
""Christmas is indeed one of the most anticipated holidays in the Philippines where Filipino families traditionally spend time together over good food and good stories. But may we also remember that Christmas this year, as with last year, brings sadness and grief to many of our countrymen who will not be with their loved ones killed in Duterte's drug war,"" De Lima said in a statement.
Aside from this, De Lima added that she wishes to be vindicated from the drug charges against her, which she maintains were fabricated.
Minority Senator Francis Pangilinan also called on the public to reflect on the hardships many families had to face this year.

(Even if it's sad, they embody the heart of the Filipino that keeps on fighting. We are a resilient people, a country that keeps on seeing hope and love amid struggles. There is no doubt that they would also find happiness welcoming the birth of Christ.)
Peace, unity
Senator Grace Poe, for her part, wished for an ""outpouring of love and compassion"" for the poor and downtrodden, including the families of slain victims. (READ: For families of EJK victims, Christmas will no longer be the same)
""Let the Christmas season be an outpouring of love and compassion for the families in shelters due to fighting and calamities; for the relatives crying out for justice for their killed kin; for our men in uniform in the field; for our OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) in faraway places; and for the zestful youth, especially those who make use of social media to make their voices heard,"" she said.
Poe and Senator Joel Villanueva also called for peace and unity among Filipinos.
""This season is an invitation for us to reinforce the ties as Filipinos, woven from our shared hopes and aspirations of a progressive future for all. Let's spread love, not hatred. Let our faith grow stronger towards justice, reconciliation, peace, and compassion. These are the greatest gifts we can give to our fellow Filipinos,"" Poe said.
""Amidst the challenges our nation faced over the past year, we are grateful for all the tremendous opportunities that God Almighty has bestowed on the Filipino people. This holiday season, I pray for unity and peace in our nation and may the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ bring new hope for the Philippines,"" Villanueva said.
Meanwhile, Senator Loren Legarda called on the public to reflect and be grateful for the year.
""The Yuletide season is more than just a joyful celebration. It is also a time to reflect and be grateful. As we end this year and welcome a new one, let us appreciate the experiences we had and the people who have helped us turn our adversities into triumphs, misgivings into wisdom, and doubts into hope,"" she said. 
Senator Francis Pangilinan also urged Filipinos to remember families who went through a lot this 2017.
""Maraming nawalan ng pamilya at kaibigan sa madugong kampanya na nagdulot ng sakit at lungkot para sa mga biktima nito. Marami ang magdiriwang nang malayo sa mga tahanang ipinagkaila sa kanilang mabalikan. Marami ang magdiriwang nang mag-isa,"" he said in a statement sent on Christmas eve.
(Many lost family and friends to the bloody campaign that caused pain and sadness to its victims. Many will spend Christmas away from homes they cant return to. Many will celebrate it alone.)
Pangilinan still expressed hope this Christmas, noting that Filipinos are strong – a nation that always sees hope and love despite problems.
""Walang duda na makakakita sila ng paraan para salubungin ang pagsilang ni Kristo nang may ngiti sa kanilang mga mukha. Ito ang tunay na diwa ng Pasko, at kung ano ang 'sinisimbolo ng pagsilang ni Kristo: ligaya, pag-asa, at kaligtasan.""

MANILA, Philippines – As couples celebrated Valentine's Day on Wednesday, February 14, families of the victims of the government's war on drugs gathered in a mass at Sto. Niño Parish Church in Caloocan City to offer prayers to their slain loved ones.
Many of the bereaved parents, widows, and orphans who attended come from Bagong Silang in Caloocan, one of the most gravely affected communities in Metro Manila in terms of the fatalities.
""As the beginning of Lent also coincides with Valentine’s Day, the season’s call for recollection brought the families together for a meaningful remembrance of their lost loved ones,"" said the CSO-CHR Consultative Caucus on Human Rights in a press statement.

""Deaths caused by EJK causes greater pain for these families: even as they search for justice, many of these families continue to struggle with poverty and the trauma of violence.""
One of the most controversial cases in the community was a case of a vigilante killing, dubbed ""the Caloocan massacre,"" on December 28, 2016, that left 7 people dead, including a pregnant woman and 3 minors.

The 3 men were reported missing one after the other since October 8.
Still fresh in the memory of Iba residents was the case of similarly 3 missing persons whose dead bodies were later dumped in one shallow grave near a river in San Felipe, Zambales three months ago.
Media here tried to coordinate with the head of the Iba Municipal Police Office, Chief Inspector Julius Caesar Noveno, but he refused to answer questions because he said he was busy attending a conference. 
Relatives have been posting on social media about the latest missing men, who all disappeared in the span of one week this month. 
First reported missing on October 8 was Jonash Alba, 30, of Acayan St., Barangay Palanginan. Alba’s wife, Danna Belles, said her husband went out to buy cigarettes but has not returned since.
She said Alba was wearing a gray T-shirt with black sleeves and had red ball cap when he left the house.
On October 13, James Camba, 39, a water refiller, of Purok 4, was reported missing in Barangay Palanginan. Reports said Camba had no known enemies in the neighborhood.

""Sigurado ako may sinalvage, sigurado ako diyan, and we will investigate,"" he said on Thursday, August 4, during an environment summit in Davao City.
(I am sure there are salvage victims, I am sure of that, and we will investigate.)
Duterte spent a bulk of his speech talking about his administration's campaign against illegal drugs. He had been explaining how some 470,000 drug addicts have already surrendered and how the fight must be sustained to save the Philippines from being a ""fractured country.""
While ""salvage"" in English means ""to save"", in Filipino it is also slang for summary killings or deaths that occur under mysterious circumstances.
While around 300 drug suspects have been killed in police operations, there have also been many drug-related deaths in the past months that happened mysteriously. 
In some cases, bodies were found in alleyways or side streets with signs identifying them, supposedly, as a drug addict, pusher, or drug lord.
In others, persons who did not fit the profile of a drug suspect were shot at. Relatives of these victims insisted they were just at the wrong place, at the wrong time. (READ: Drug user? No, Oman was a good son and Lauren Rosales: Don't remember her as the girl killed in a jeep)
'Suspects fought back'
After saying he would have such cases investigated, Duterte defended the police in cases when drug suspects were killed during their operations.
Duterte, echoing the police, insisted that the drug suspects fought back thereby forcing the police to use deadly force.
""'Yang ganoon, may baril talaga 'yan, at maniwala ka diyan sa mga pulis na 'yan,"" he said. (They really have guns, believe what the police say.)
Duterte said police are placed in a very dangerous situation when facing a suspect whose brains are addled with drugs.
""Lumalaban talaga 'yan, kaya lang siyempre ang pulis, ang kalaban niya bangag, cannot even shoot straight,"" he said. 
(They really fight, and of course the police, the enemy is not in his right mind and cannot even shoot straight.)
The President even said he learned the previous night that a chief of police had been shot during an anti-illegal drugs operation.
He said he plans to pass by the hospital to visit the policeman before going to his office in the Malacañang of the South in the Panacan district.
Duterte's war on drugs has earned criticism from human rights groups who allege it has encouraged the killing of drug suspects without due process.
The police said all drug suspects killed during their operations fought back. The rise in number of extrajudicial killings that accompanied the war on drugs is due to drug syndicates killing each other, said the police. – Rappler.com

In a statement, Karapatan secretary general Tinay Palabay called the Duterte administration“not a government for the people"" because of its rising number of reported violations.
""As we mark International Human Rights Day with protest, we likewise register our continuing resolve to defend people’s rights and resist tyranny and dictatorship,” she said.
According to latest data from the Philippine National Police, almost 5,000 people were killed in police operations while groups estimate the number at more than 20,000 to include victims of extrajudicial killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
In Defense of Human Rights and Dignity (iDEFEND), meanwhile, calls on the public to remain steadfast in demanding the government to adhere to the rule of law and human rights as mandated by the 1987 Philippine Constitution and various international legal instruments signed by the Philippines. 
“In order to realize our full potential as Filipinos we must be equally relentless in pursuing social justice and the rule of law,” the group said. 
“Let us do away with a dispensation that negates our humanity, strengthen our ranks and specifically in the coming 2019 elections bring forth a true government for human rights,"" it added.

The Philippines' role in the first years of the UDHR's adoption, the group said, ""is a reminder for everyone, especially for church people, that we must constantly be vigilant and act upon what our faith has taught us: that the respect and promotion of human rights can help in bringing about the good news of God’s peace."" – Rappler.com

Fernando, a political detainee in the 80s serving a second term in the municipal council of Lezo, Aklan, succumbed to gunshot wounds -- one to the neck, the other to the head. A bullet pierced through his helmet. And the perpetrators fled. 
The killing bore the imprint of impunity which characterized the human rights situation during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. But it happened during the term of President Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III, a few days before his first State of the Nation Address in 2010. 
Fernando was the first reported victim of extrajudicial killing under the current administration. Ironically, during the 2010 elections, he ran under the President's party.

UN human rights review
The Philippine Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said it investigated the incident and that police filed case number INV 101101573 in a local court in 2010. Warrants of arrests were issued but were never served. 
Lamenting that his family has not gotten justice in the country, Fernando's son, Ernan, took his father's case to the United Nations (UN), which is reviewing the human rights records of its member-countries from May 29 to June 1.
""We came here to Geneva to tell the international community that impunity and injustice are continuing in the Philippines,"" Ernan told human rights organizations and representatives of foreign missions now gathering in Switzerland for the second Universal Periodic Review (UPR).
According to the Philippine UPR Watch, Fernando's case is one of the 76 cases of extrajudicial killings that took place under the Aquino government. The group also reported 9 cases of enforced disappearances.   
However, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, who led a 29-member delegation in Geneva, reported to the UN that the Aquino government has undertaken actions that ""resulted in a dramatic decrease"" in reported incidents of extrajudicial killings.
During the first cycle of the rights review in 2008, the Philippines, voluntarily committed ""to maintain the momentum on addressing killings of activists and media professionals.""
""The wheels of the Philippine justice system are indeed moving, with all verified cases either under investigation or already in the courts,"" De Lima assured the UN body conducting the second cycle of the review.
The CHR, which monitors the government's compliance with its human rights obligations, reported only 24 cases of murder, frustrated murder, killing and salvaging from July 2010 to March 2012.
Enforce measures to end impunity
According to De Lima, Task Force Usig, a special unit under the Philippine National Police, has independently verified that incidents of extrajudicial killings and torture have clearly declined under the Aquino administration. 
De Lima also stressed that the Aquino government condemns these crimes and that it is committed to resolving verified cases and bringing perpetrators to justice, whether they are state or non-state actors.
However, Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said, ""It is not enough for the Philippines to merely acknowledge concerns about continuing abuses and impunity raised by UN member states.” 
“The Aquino administration needs to implement enforceable and time-bound measures to end abuses and ensure that those who commit them are prosecuted,” Pearson added. 
More than 300 complaints on human rights violations allegedly committed by the police and military between July 2010 to March 2012 were documented by the CHR.
States grill PH on rights record
On the eve of the review, Ernan said he had spoken to different country missions in the UN and hoped they would ask tough questions of the Philippine government. He was not dissapointed. A total of 67 States participated in the discussion, raising issues and posing a series of recommendations to the Philippine delegation. 
What dissapointed Ernan and human rights advocates observing the review was the government's selective presentation of information and emphasis on the treaties it signed.
""The GPH report drowns the essentials on the failure of the Aquino administration to improve or change the human rights situation in PH. These facts remain -- EJKs, torture, enforced disappearances continue to be committed with impunity, with efforts to seek accountability being solely shouldered by the victims themselves and their kin -- Karapatan spokesperson Cristina Palabay said.
""These facts were glossed over by the gloating emphasis of the GPH on their long-overdue obligations to international rights,"" added Palabay, who is a member of the Philippine UPR Watch delegation in Switzerland. 
De Lima reported that the Philippines ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Protocol 1 Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which was a particular recommendation during the 2008 review. 
The Philippines is now a signatory to 8 international human rights treaties.
This is the 2nd time that the UN's Human Rights Council is conducting the lone international rights review since it was formed in 2008. The human rights body is expected to adopt the report of the UPR Working Group on the Philippines this Friday evening, June 1 (Manila time). -- Rappler.com

The family and friends of Kim Lester Ramos trooped to the Marikina City Hall of Justice on Monday morning, wearing the same white shirts and carrying the same tarpaulins that called for justice when Kim was buried in October. Ramos was the 23-year-old construction worker killed by Soller after Ramos allegedly tried to snatch the cop’s gun – a narrative fiercely contested by members of Ramos’ quiet Marikina community.
Ramos’ father, Norman, led the crowd and filed the complaint, backing up his claims with “5 to 7 witnesses” according to their lawyers from the Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment through Alternative Legal Services or IDEALS.
Lauro Lagarde, Kim Lester Ramos’ childhood friend who was present during the shooting, accused Soller of frustrated murder for shooting Lagarde at the hip in the same encounter. Lagarde then played dead, and when he opened his eyes briefly, he said he saw Soller shoot his friend at the back of the head point-blank.
After the case received extensive media coverage, Soller was relieved from his post in the Marikina City Police office as an intelligence agent and placed in a holding unit, effectively putting him on ""floating status.""

Why this matters: Many families have stepped forward to tell the public that cops in the Philippine National Police (PNP) have killed their relatives and friends in anti-drug operations, but only a few have decided to formalize their accusations into a legal complaint.
With the complaint submitted, Norman Ramos hopes that his son is afforded the same verdict as the case of Kian delos Santos, the 17-year-old Caloocan boy who was killed by cops then painted in police reports as a drug runner.
“Sana manalo kami kasi sinungaling naman ang pulis na yan…Bakit niya binaril ang anak ko sa ulo eh tumatakbo na nga eh (I hope we win in this case. Why did he shoot my son in the head even if he was already running?),” Norman Ramos told reporters in an interview after the filing of the complaint.
Ramos and Lagarde’s lawyers have declined to share the complaints as they wanted to keep their witnesses confidential to keep them safe from harassment.
Kim Lester Ramos is among at least 5,500 killed suspects whom cops have accused of “fighting back” in anti-drug operations. Human rights groups, however, estimate the kill tally to have reached over 30,000, including killings inspired by President Rodrigo Duterte’s so-called war on drugs. – Rappler.com

This claim is a lie. 
Evoking images of Michelangelo's Pietà, the photo was taken by award-winning photojournalist Raffy Lerma, and was published on PDI's front page on July 24, 2016. 
The photo came under fire after Malacañang said on Saturday, October 21, that Siaron was killed by a member of a drug syndicate, not the police. Based on this claim by the government, propagandists and trolls attacked PDI and Lerma for supposedly publishing a piece of ""fake news."" 
PDI, however, never said in its original photo caption that the Philippine National Police (PNP) killed Siaron. 
What PDI said was that Siaron was killed by ""motorcycle-riding gunmen.""
Here is PDI's caption for that photo on July 24, 2016: ""A weeping Jennelyn Olaires hugs partner Michael Siaron, 30, a pedicab driver and alleged drug pusher, who was shot and killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen near Pasay Rotonda on Edsa. He was one of six killed in drug-related incidents in Pasay and Manila yesterday.""
A screenshot of this Inquirer front page, as uploaded online, is embedded below.
BANNER PHOTO. The caption of this Inquirer photo on July 24, 2016, is as follows: 'A weeping Jennelyn Olaires hugs partner Michael Siaron, 30, a pedicab driver an alleged drug pusher, who was shot and killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen near Pasay Rotonda on Edsa. He was one of six killed in drug-related incidents in Pasay and Manila yesterday.' Screenshot from www.inquirer.
net
The copy of PDI's page one on July 24, 2016, where the photo appears, is also accessible on the PDI website. 
A similar photo, shot by award-winning photojournalist Noel Celis, was published by Agence France-Presse. 
The Agence France-Presse photo came with this caption: ""This photo taken on July 23, 2016 shows Jennilyn Olayres (centre) hugging the dead body of her partner Michael Siaron who was shot by unidentified gunman (sic) and left with a cardboard sign with a message 'I'm a pusher' along a street in Manila.""
'Fake news' from Tiglao
Still, former journalist Rigoberto Tiglao wrote a Manila Times column on October 23 this year, titled, ""Fakest 'fake news' was viral Inquirer photo.""
""Siaron, the newspaper claimed,* was executed by the police in the course of President Duterte's war against illegal drugs,"" according to Tiglao, former spokesman of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, an ally of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Tiglao's column came with the following footnote: ""To be accurate, the PDI in the article that accompanied the photo did not blame the police, reporting only that the pedicab driver was killed by 'two men riding on a motorcycle.' It was the photographer Lerma who would write four days later, referring to the victim: 'It was the third extrajudicial killing of suspected drug pushers that I covered on the graveyard shift last week.' Extrajudicial killing is defined as executions by the police or other state agents of suspected criminals without the sanction of a court.""
Lerma wrote about this ""third extrajudicial killing of suspected drug pushers"" in an opinion piece for the Inquirer. While opinion writers, like Tiglao himself, do not represent the official stance of their newspapers, Tiglao nevertheless said it was the Inquirer that ""claimed"" Siaron was killed by the police.
In his opinion piece, Lerma never said the PNP killed Siaron, as Tiglao falsely claimed. (READ: Tiglao and his fever swamp of conspiracy theories)
Abella, Cayetano, Andanar
Like Tiglao, officials of the Duterte administration released statements on the Pietà photo based on the wrong premise.
Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said on Saturday, ""The relentless attribution of such killings to police operations was both premature and unfair to law abiding enforcement officers who risk life and limb to stop the proliferation of illegal drugs in our society."" 
Days later, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a post by state-run PTV, ""The identification of the suspected killer of Michael Siaron, also referred to as the Pietà drug suspect, vindicates the members of the PNP and other law enforcement agencies who were portrayed as merciless killers."" 
In an interview on Wednesday, October 25, Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano also cited the Pietà image in discussing a recent meeting with European Union officials.
""We're also telling them, look at the alleged Pietà picture. It already went around the world, it already went to international organizations, and they condemned the PNP, and even if you look at the survey, mayroong hindi naniniwala sa PNP dahil sa mga iyon (there are some who don't believe in the PNP because of those things),"" Cayetano said.
It was in the same interview that Cayetano backtracked on his earlier statement that the Philippines was rejecting all forms of grants from the EU.
Duterte's defeated running mate said that if critics ""only waited for the investigation,"" they would have found out that a ""drug lord,"" not the PNP, had Siaron killed.
Duterte himself said, however, that 9,000 policemen, or 4 in every 100 cops, use or sell illegal drugs.  
Policemen have also been suspected as behind vigilante-style drug war killings across the Philippines.
In October 2016, two young police officers – Senior Inspector Magdalino Pimentel Jr and Inspector Markson Almeranez  – were accused of gunning down Citizens Crime Watch regional director Zenaida Luz in front of her house in Oriental Mindoro. 
Pimentel supposedly wore a ""bonnet and hoodie jacket"" while Almeranez used a ""facemask and a wig to disguise himself,"" according to the Manila Bulletin. The Bulletin story was titled, ""2 PNP officials unmasked as riding-in-tandem killers.""
Months later, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David denounced vigilantes as ""termites"" and ""new Judases,"" as he questioned why the PNP has failed to catch these unidentified killers. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Families left behind by people killed in the Philippine government's bloody anti-drug campaign took their quest for justice to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
On Tuesday, August 28, the families who convened under the Rise Up for Life and for Rights network called on the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor to indict and eventually convict President Rodrigo Duterte for thousands of extrajudicial killings.
In a 50-page complaint addressed to Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, the families ""call for an end to madness and for President Duterte, who has likened himself to one of the most evil men in history, to be brought before the ICC and be held to account for crimes against humanity.""
""The extrajudicial killings, mass arrests, roving searches, and other inhumane acts in the Philippines under the auspices, order, command, and policy of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte threaten the core principles of humanity itself, subsuming individual victim experiences, and even state borders,"" the families told the ICC.
Aside from Rise Up, relatives of 6 victims are also named in the document – Irma Locasia, Dennise David, Maria Lozano, Mariel Sabangan, Normita Lopez, and Purisima Dacumos. They are represented by the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL).
Hoping for progress at ICC
This is the latest complaint sent to the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor, which began a preliminary examination of the anti-drug campaign back in February. The office, at this stage, is determining if there is sufficient evidence to establish that the case falls under its jurisdiction.
Duterte, however, ordered the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC last March. This move is now the subject of oral arguments on Tuesday, August 28, at the Supreme Court (SC), after minority senators challenged its validity in May.
But the outcome of the petition at the SC would have no bearing on the preliminary examination at the ICC. Article 127 of the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding document, states that any investigation or criminal proceeding that started before the withdrawal takes effect would still continue.
The timeline of the ICC's preliminary examination is unknown, but NUPL chairperson Neri Colmenares hopes it would be completed soon. (READ: ICC's track record and what it means for Duterte and the PH)
""We don't know when the ICC will move forward, but we're hoping this will happen before dumami pa ang mga mamatay (more people are killed),"" Colmenares said.
""Malakas ang influence ni Pangulong Duterte na hindi mabigyan ng katarungan sa local courts ang mga biktima (President Duterte's influence is so far-reaching that local courts would not be able to give justice to the victims).""
'More than our loved ones'
The families' quest for justice has now gone beyond their sons and husbands.
According to Dennise David, whose son John Jezreel David was killed in January 2017, he doesn't want other families to suffer their ordeal.
""Ayaw kong maramdaman ng ibang magulang iyong naramdaman ko. Gusto ko matigil na itong pamamaslang na ito kasi hindi makatarungan,"" he said.
(I don't want other parents to feel what I feel. I want these killings to stop because it isn't right.)
John Jezreel's case is now pending before the Office of the Ombudsman. Since filing the case in September 2017, Dennise has left his home and fled to outside Metro Manila, sacrificing his livelihood and time with his family.
Dennise said: ""Kailangan natin gawin iyon para makamit natin iyong katarungan. Hindi ako nagtatago kasi takot ako, proteksiyon rin ito para sa sarili ko kasi kung nawala ako, sino'ng lalaban para sa anak ko?""

""Manuel is Randall Echanis,"" Perez told Rappler in a text message. 
The ""Manuel"" that Perez referred to was Manuel Santiago, the name on one of the identification cards found by the police in the crime scene. Cruz did not explain why Echanis was using a different name.
Echanis was known  as an agrarian reform advocate. He was credited for his work in helping craft the the Genuine Agrarian Reform Bill (GARB).
Echanis also served as political consultant for the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). He is the 4th NDF political consultant to be killed, after Sotero Llamas, Randy Malayao, and Julius Giron.
The Quezon City Police District (QCPD) earlier reported that the only sensational case in their area that took place the same time as Echanis' murder was the stabbing incident that killed 2 men in Novaliches.
However, the QCPD insisted that none of the victims was Echanis, saying that they were a certain Manuel Santiago and a certain Louie Tagapia.  Manuel Santiago was Echanis after all.
Perez said there has been no correction made with regards to the identity of Louie Tagapia.
Initial investigation showed that at 1:35 am on Monday, a witness heard a ""loud noise"" from the 2nd floor of  No. 14 Petronia Street in Barangay Novaliches, Quezon City. The witness went to check the source of the noise and found the bodies of Echanis and Tagapia.
Without citing a source, police said in their report that around 5 people could have killed Echanis and Tagapia.
The SOCO team recovered  identification cards, a Dell Laptop, a small notebook, 2 USBs and P400 cash.
The investigation of Echanis' killing has been delegated to the QCPD's Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit (CIDU), which usually handles high-profile killings. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday, December 11, again rejected allegations that killings being linked to his war on drugs are state-sponsored.
In a speech at the Belenismo sa Tarlac 2016 Awards in Tarlac City, the President denied ever ordering the police or the military to carry out summary executions.
""Ayaw kong pumatay. Nasasaktan akong pumatay ng Pilipino. Ayaw ko, pareho tayo. (I don't want Filipinos to get killed. It's painful for me to see Filipinos dead. I don't want that, like you.) ...Do you think I enjoy [that]?"" Duterte said.
""I do not allow extrajudicial [killings]... We do not do that. It's a dirty job,"" he added. ""At saka para kang hindi lalaki. Talian mo, balutin mo, it's a form of torture, binabalot ng plastik. Hindi trabaho ng pulis 'yan pati sundalo.""
(And it's also as if you're not man enough. Tie up a victim, wrap him in plastic, it's a form of torture, wrapping in plastic. That's not the work of policemen or soldiers.)
The President reiterated that his marching orders are for cops to shoot only if suspects resist arrest or fight back. (READ: Shoot to kill? Duterte's statements on killing drug users)
""Hanapin mo sila, arestuhin mo kung kaya pa, pagka-lumaban at may armas ... that would place the life of the police or military man, pati siya madadamay sa kamatayan, unahan na ninyo. That's my order,"" he said.
(Find the suspects, arrest them, if they fight back and they have weapons that would place the life of the policeman or military man in danger, then fire at them. That's my order.)
More than 5,800 deaths have been linked to the Duterte administration's anti-drug campaign since July 1. Of this figure, around 2,000 have been killed in police operations, while the rest are victims of extrajudicial or vigilante-style killings. (READ: Dela Rosa to Senate: We are not butchers)
""We will, I will address the problems of extrajudicial killing. It is not our job. Maniwala kayo (Believe me). Even before the elections. Please look back in the hands of time and you would notice that marami nang nagpatay-patayan (killings were rampant even then),"" Duterte said. (READ: Duterte: We will investigate mysterious killings)
The President also said he cannot lose momentum in the fight against drugs, despite the criticism being thrown at him. (READ: Duterte hopeful war on drugs 'nearly over')
Senator Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics, earlier dubbed him ""the father of all extrajudicial killings"" and said he was a ""murderer."" De Lima's remarks came after Duterte vowed to protect police officers tagged in the murder of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr, who was linked to drugs by the President himself.
On Saturday, December 10 – International Human Rights Day – human rights activists across the country also condemned what they described as Duterte's ""worsening human rights record.""
""Duterte's remorseless extrajudicial killings in his crusade against drugs is unacceptable... Duterte has been using this campaign to sow fear among the people,"" the League of Filipino Students had said. – Rappler.com

(Our slain brothers and sisters will never be in peace. They will always remind us, every November, every time it is their death anniversary, to seek justice for them.)
Father Gilbert Billena, spokesperson of the group Rise Up for Life and for Rights, made this call on the eve of All Saints' Day, November 1.
All Saints' Day, also called Undas in the Philippines, is the day for remembering the dead in this predominantly Catholic country. 
Undas this year comes as President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs, which has run for more than a year, has killed more than 14,000 people in both police operations and vigilante-style killings. (READ: Church to hold EDSA march vs killings on November 5)
Billena talked about this in a Mass for victims of drug war killings at San Isidro Labrador Parish in Bagong Silangan, Quezon City, on Tuesday morning, October 31.
Billena explained that even in the Book of Revelations in the Bible, martrys, even though in heaven, still prayed for justice for themselves.
'May katapusan din ang lahat'
The priest said justice for drug war victims – even if not today or tomorrow – is sure to come.
""Alam natin na may katapusan din ang lahat. Katulad noong Martial Law, maraming pinatay at pinaslang, ngunit may katapusan din ang diktadurya. At naniniwala tayo na may katapusan din ang ganitong klaseng pamamaraan at pang-aapi ng estado sa mga mahihirap at mga biktima,"" Billena said.
(We know that there's an end to everything. In the case of Martial Law, when many people were killed, the dictatorship also came to an end. And we believe there will also be an end to this kind of persecution by the state against poor victims.)

MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) is striving to keep up with investigations as the death toll continues to rise two years into President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign.
Latest data obtained by Rappler show that since 2016, the CHR has handled 1,106 drug-related cases with 1,345 victims. Out of this number of cases, 594 stemmed from police operations, while 512 were vigilante-style killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
CHR Spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia admitted their current case load does not represent even half of the reality on the ground, adding that the extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration are ""a new phenomenon"" for the commission. 
""If you are to compare the number of cases [the CHR is handling] to the entire situation, it really pales in comparison and we're very much aware of that,"" De Guia told Rappler. ""In terms of rate and scale, we never did encounter this [many] killings.""
""Masyado na talagang marami (There are really a lot) and we cannot really cope with the sheer number of cases,"" she added.
Anti-drug operations of the Philippine National Police (PNP) claimed the lives of 4,729 suspects between July 1, 2016 and May 15, 2018. But human rights groups estimate that drug war killings have reached almost 20,000. (READ: In the PH drug war, it's likely EJK when...)
All in all, police documents show 33 people have been killed each day since Duterte became president in 2016.  
The problem with the CHR setup 
Created through the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the CHR is mandated to investigate alleged human rights abuses by state actors such as the military or police. (READ: Things to know: Human rights in the Philippines)
But the setup of the CHR as an institution and its lack of manpower hinder it from doing its job as efficiently as possible, especially given the magnitude of the anti-drug campaign, according to De Guia.
""The way we are set up as an institution is not really meant to be as responsive as law enforcement agencies are,"" she explained.
Unlike in the case of the PNP which has a unit in each city or municipality, the CHR has to make do with regional offices, and only 7 to 10 investigators per region.
In response to the Philippine situation during the early months of the Duterte administration, the commission established a task force on extrajudicial killings. It also identified a focal person per region to ensure that investigations into extrajudicial killings move in their jurisdiction.
For major incidents, such as ""one-time, big-time"" operations by police which result in many casualties, the CHR activates a special composite team of investigators pulled in from various regional offices.
It doesn't help that the PNP has so far failed to make good on its promise to efficiently cooperate with the CHR. In fact, police have not given case documents to aid CHR investigations despite several requests from the commission since 2016. (READ: Evading probes? The many times Duterte admin didn't give drug war documents)
""Dati ang daling makakuha ng police reports tapos minsan hindi mo kailangan mag-subpoena o magbigay ng letter minsan. Ngayon, wala ka na makuhanan talaga,"" De Guia said.
(It was so easy to get police reports before that we didn't even have to issue subpoenas or send letters. Now, it's so hard to obtain documents.)
Climate of fear, war on the poor
There are few families filing complaints over the deaths of their loved ones in the anti-drug campaign – another reason behind the low number of cases in the past two years.
According to latest data, 90% of the cases being handled by the CHR since 2016 are motu proprio, or investigations initiated by the commission itself. These incidents are monitored through media reports.
Unfortunately, however, leads sometimes go nowhere as relatives opt not to file a complaint, while some witnesses become uncooperative. The climate of fear hinders families from moving forward.
Filing complaints, according to Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch (HRW), is already ""an act of extreme self-sacrifice"" as victims' families expose themselves to danger.
In fact, the CHR's help desk recorded a significant increase in the number of families seeking assistance when the anti-drug campaign was suspended. 
""Meron talagang impact iyong climate of fear dahil takot sila kasi ang binabangga mo ay pulis. Nagtatanong raw kasi iyong mga pulis na kung saan gagamitin iyong mga documents na hinihingi ng family ng victims. Pahihirapan sila,"" De Guia said.
(The climate of fear has an impact since victims' families are afraid because they're going against the police. The police often ask the families what they intend to do with the documents they're asking for. They're given a hard time.)
But Conde pointed out that victims, who come from lower-income groups, may already have been conditioned that the law will never favor them.
""The fact that many of them have run-ins with the law in the past discourages them from pursuing cases for fear of incriminating themselves, adding to their troubles,"" he said. ""I think the fear for physical safety is just a small part of the problem – the fear for the institutions of justice plays a larger role in all this.""
Intimidating legal process, lack of support system
Aside from the fear of retribution, the entire process of filing and pursuing a case is seen as intimidating. The legal fees, together with other expenses tied to going to and from courts, are too much for the poor.
Human rights lawyer Edre Olalia of the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) pointed out that juggling a legal battle with daily life is not an easy task.
""The poor are preoccupied with sheer daily survival that they cannot afford the added hardship of dealing with a largely slow, tedious, complicated, and even skewed process,"" he told Rappler.
This was echoed by De Guia, but she noted that the CHR has partnered with civil society groups to establish a support system for victims' families.
The commission has also tapped several law organizations such as the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for legal support, as well as the Balay Rehabilitation Center for psychosocial counseling.
The CHR, however, acknowledged that financial aid and other types of assistance during the course of investigation aren't enough, adding that they've lacked post-investigation support. 
""It's a reality na hindi sapat iyong ibibigay na financial assistance namin kasi nawalan ang mga pamilya na ito ng income earner eh (It's a reality that the financial assistance we give won't be enough because these families lost an income earner),"" De Guia explained.
It also does not help, she added, that other government agencies do not have any program to assist victims' families aside from helping with burial expenses. (READ: The cost of dying in Duterte's drug war)
""Ang dali sa amin na i-refer ang victims ng ibang violations sa other government agencies kasi may programa para sa kanila. Kaya lang wala talagang programa ang government para doon sa survivors ng extrajudicial killings, kaya nagkaroon ng gap,"" De Guia said.
(It's easy to refer victims of other violations to other government agencies because there are programs for them. But the government does not have a program for survivors of extrajudicial killings, that's why there's a gap.)
Olalia, meanwhile, said that the families should be made aware that they are not alone in the fight for justice.
""Educate them and assure them that credible individuals and groups are willing to help them see this through without anything in return but to seek justice,"" he said.  ""[We need to] explain to them that what happened to them could happen to many others and that seeking justice for their kin is imperative to stop the madness and grief.""
Need for a law
Duterte is entering his 3rd year in office and the fight for accountability will still continue despite incidents seen as setbacks – including the Philippines' planned withdrawal from the International Criminal Court. (READ: The year of deaths and denials in the drug war)
Seeking accountability, according to Conde, is very important as it will empower the victims' families.
""If they see that the judicial system works, or that a police officer or suspect has been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted, they are more likely to come out and file complaints,"" he said.
""Duterte himself has said that he is going to pardon anybody who is convicted, so the victims ask: What is the point of pursuing cases if the perpetrators are already assured of being pardoned even if assuming that their case would even go past the inquest phase?"" Conde added.
Congress should also come up with a law that will further spell out and strengthen the punishment for those who commit extrajudicial killings, similar to the Anti-Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance Act and the Anti-Torture Act.
Until then, the CHR will have to make do with its current resources in a bid to ensure that the thousands of victims of what critics call ""the worst human rights crisis since Martial Law"" get justice – even if it may take a while. – Rappler.com

""Ang extrajudicial killings ay paggawa ng bagay na hindi ayon sa batas. 'Yan ay krimen. Kaya hindi mababawasan ang krimen sa pamamagitan ng paggawa ng krimen,"" Pabillo said in a Mass to pray for victims of extrajudicial killings.
(To do extrajudicial killings is to do something that is against the law. That’s a crime. We cannot suppress crime by committing another crime.)
The extrajudicial killings have been linked to Duterte's war against illegal drugs. Referring to the victims of these killings, he said, ""Tao pa rin 'yun."" (They’re still persons.)
He added that there’s no proof that the slain suspects actually engage in drug trafficking. “Wala namang nagsabi sa atin niyan, maliban sa nakalagay na karatula sa kanila,” he said. (No one told us that, aside from the cardboards placed on top of them.)
At the same time, Pabillo showed concern for the family members of victims of extrajudicial killings.
""Kahit na totoo na sila ay drug pusher at nakagawa ng masama sa ibang tao, paano naman ang kanilang mga pamilya? Sila rin ngayon ay ginawan ng masama,"" he said.
(Even if it’s true that they’re drug pushers and they did something wrong to other people, what about their families? They themselves have been done wrong.)
The bishop asked, ""Maitutuwid ba natin ang masama sa pamamagitan ng masama?"" (Can we correct evil by doing evil?)
Duterte: Priests can't stop death
During his SONA on Monday, Duterte defended the killings of suspected drug pushers. 
Duterte earlier said he will protect policemen who kill suspected drug pushers in legitimate police operations. The long-time Davao City mayor, on the other hand, previously said there is ""no honor"" in extrajudicial kilings.
Duterte said in his SONA: ""Kayo namang hindi pa bungog diyan, hindi pa pumasok 'yang mga droga, e kung ayaw ninyong mamatay, ayaw ninyong masaktan, huwag kayong umasa diyan sa mga pari, pati human rights. Hindi nakakapigil 'yan ng kamatayan.""
(As for you who aren’t yet groggy, who haven’t gotten involved in drugs, if you don’t want to die, if you don’t want to get hurt, do not count on those priests, even those in human rights. They cannot stop death.)
The Mass on Monday – with the theme ""Huwag Kang Papatay"" (Thou Shall Not Kill) – is the first major movement of Catholics in response to Duterte's bloody war against illegal drugs. (READ: Mass held for 'sacrificial victims' in war vs drugs)
Estimates show at least 300 people have died in the war against drugs. This figure includes those killed in legitimate police operations and those in extrajudicial killings as well.
Leaders of Catholic nuns, the president of De La Salle Philippines, and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, among others, have voiced their concern over the killings since Duterte won the presidency.  
Former Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Viña on Monday said killing suspected drug traffickers will not win Duterte’s war against drugs. 
La Viña said in a pre-SONA analysis on Rappler: ""We all agree that the war on drugs won't be won by extrajudicial killings, or even death penalty, or even legitimate encounters. The war against drugs is also a war on poverty, war on powerlessness."" – with reports from Rambo Talabong and Janelle Paris/Rappler.com

Most of the victims were in their homes when armed men attacked them in the wee hours of the day.
The killings continued in the month of August, claiming at least 4 more lives. We have listed the killing incidents, who the victims were, where the killings took place, and the manner with which they were carried out.
The first casualties are the 4 police intelligence officers – Corporal Relebert Beronio, Patrolman Raffy Callao, Patrolman Ruel Cabellon, and Patrolman Marquino de Leon of the 704 Mobile Force Company of the Regional Mobile Force Battalion in Central Visayas – ambushed by the New People's Army (NPA) in Barangay Mabato in Ayungon town. The 4 victims, who were set up for the ambush, were supposed to meet their contact in the village, who turned out to have links with the rebels.
The chieftain of the village, Sunny Caldera, who was also tagged in the killings of the policemen, dies 5 days after the ambush. He allegedly drank pesticide. More than 20 suspects are tagged in the ambush-slay of the policemen, 8 of them already arrested and charged. 
 
Lawyer Anthony Trinidad from San Carlos City in Negros Occidental is killed in Guihulngan City. Aboard a sports utility vehicle with his wife and a client, they are waylaid by unknown assailants who shoot them at close range. The lawyer dies at the hospital, his wife sustains injuries, while the client is unscathed.
Rebel returnee Weny Alegre and Felimino Janayan, leader of a farmer's association, are gunned down by 4 unidentified men on two motorcycles in Zamboanguita town. The victims, also on board a motorcycle, were on their way home when they were attacked by the suspects and shot at close range.
In Dumaguete City, resident Yngwie Malmstien Fabugais who was watching television inside his home, is also shot several times by two unidentified men who enter his home. The police have yet to establish the motive for the killing. 
The bloodiest day, thus far, with 7 people killed in a span of 24 hours.
In Guihulngan City, Arthur Bayawa, a school principal and his sister, Ardale Bayawa, an official of the local Department of Education office, are shot dead inside their residence. Unidentified armed men barge into their home and kill them while they were asleep.
About 45 minutes later, Barangay Buenavista chief Romeo Alipan, is killed in Guihulngan, too, after his home is invaded by armed suspects. In Siaton town, Raklin Astorias of Barangay Maloh is shot to death by motorcycle-riding assailants. On board a motorcycle, the victim is attacked by the unidentified perpetrators.
In another shooting incident, Reden Eleuterio of Ayungon town is gunned down by unidentified men on a motorcycle. The victim dies on the spot. In Sta. Catalina town, a family is attacked by unidentified suspects, killing the father, Marlon Ocampo, and his one-year-old son Marjon. His wife and another child are wounded in the shooting.
Fedirico Sabejon of Siaton town is also killed in his home. The victim is shot dead by unidentified motorcycle-riding suspects. He is declared dead upon arrival at the hospital.
Armed men in the wee hours of the morning storm the home of Councilor Ramon Jalandoni in Barangay Panubigan in Canlaon City. They forcibly enter the house of the victim then shoot him with an unknown firearm. After a few minutes, Barangay Panubigan chief Ernesto Posadas in Canlaon is also killed after armed suspects attack his residence.
The suspects in the two Canlaon killings flee on a getaway vehicle. They also spray-paint the messages “Traidor sa NPA (Traitor to NPA)” and “Mabuhay ang NPA (Long live the NPA)” on the walls, fences, and vehicles of the victims. 
Over at Ayungon town, still on the same day, armed suspects barge into the home of former mayor Edsel Enardecido in Barangay Tampocon 1 and kill him and his cousin, Leo Enardecido. The former mayor is a cousin of the lawyer killed on July 23. 
Barangay Bucalan tanod Anaciancino Rosalita is shot dead at the Oval Public Market in Canlaon City, also in the same Panubigan village. While walking in the area, he is followed by an unidentified man who peppers him with bullets. He is the last victim for the month of July.
Joshua Partosa, a Grade 11 senior high school student, is gunned down by 4 assailants aboard two motorcycles in broad daylight in Sibulan town. Walking with his two siblings to school, the victim is shot by one of the suspects. He tries to escape but suspects catch up with him and shoot him again. He is also stabbed in the neck.
On the same day, a barangay kagawad and a former kagawad are gunned down in separate shooting incidents in neighboring Negros Occidental.
Former kagawad Fernando Toreno is shot dead by unidentified suspects on board a Ford Everest, in Barangay Kamaliskis in Salvador Benedicto. An hour later, 3 suspected assailants aboard a motorcycle are intercepted in neighboring San Carlos City. One of the suspects yields a caliber .45 pistol with magazine and ammunition.
After 4 hours, over at Moises Padilla town, Kagawad Raul Fat is shot to death by two unidentified men near the village hall in Barangay Macagahay. Two suspects approach the victim at the clinic then shoot him at close range. The two assailants, along with their 4 companions, who serve as lookout, flee the scene on foot.
 
Cristal Faith Jastiva of Bago City is shot to death by two assailants aboard a motorcycle while she is waiting for a pedicab at Magsaysay Avenue in Bacolod City, just a few meters from the Bacolod City Police Office headquarters. The victim had just come from the Metro Bacolod District Jail-Male Dormitory, which is adjacent to the city police office, to visit her partner. She is approached by the assailants who then shoot her at close range.
Meanwhile, Colonel Romeo Baleros, director of the Negros Occidental Police Provincial Office, has ordered his men to implement heightened security measures, particularly at the boundary of Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental.
At least 300 Special Action Force commandos were deployed to Negros Island to augment the local police units in their anti-criminality campaign. – Rappler.com"

MANILA, Philippines – Festive music blared from the speakers as 179 families attended a Christmas party at the Sacred Heart Village in Quezon City on Saturday, December 9.
Despite the celebratory music, however, there was sadness in the air as well.
It was, after all, not a typical Christmas party. The families present had lost a loved one to the Duterte administration's war on drugs.
The gathering had been organized by the Diocese of Novaliches to help the families heal and move forward as they fight for justice. (IN PHOTOS: Families of EJK victims celebrate early Christmas)
'No more celebration'
It served, at least for some, as a little escape from the pain and grief they have experienced from losing their loved ones.
Fe, for instance, lost her nephew Adrian in a police operation in Novaliches in August 2016. Adrian and his wife Vivian were reportedly killed while they were sleeping.
For Christmas this year, Fe promised to bring together the 7 children that the couple left behind. Fe shared that she and Vivian's parents had agreed to share the responsibility of raising the orphans – 3 are with Fe, while the 4 others are with their grandparents.
""Ang gusto lang talaga nila, magkasama-sama sila, kasi 'yun ang nakasanayan nila dati, sama-sama,"" Fe said, sobbing. ""Gagawa talaga ako ng paraan para makapag-celebrate sila ng sama-sama ngayong Pasko.""
(What they really want is to be together, just like what they're used to. I will really find a way to make sure they will celebrate Christmas together.)

For Cecilia, mother of 19-year-old Asoy, Christmas is no longer worth celebrating. Asoy, a graduate of a vocational automotive course, died last July in front of their house.
""Sabi ko sa mga anak ko, huwag na tayo mag-ano, mag-Pasko, nalulungkot lang ako dahil wala na ang anak kong isa,"" Cecilia said.
(I told my other children that we should no longer celebrate Christmas. I'm sad because one of my kids is gone.)
According to Cecilia, Asoy was a sweet, cheerful son. He even promised to buy a car so that he could help their family.
""Hindi na nga masaya sa bahay namin eh. Tapos kapag matutulog ka makikita mong kulang ang mga anak mo. Ang hirap lang talaga. Maski walang makain basta kumpleto 'yung mga anak ko,"" Cecilia shared while crying.
(Our home is no longer happy. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I see that my children are no longer complete. It's really difficult. I don't mind not having anything to eat as long as my children are complete.) 
Confronting challenges
While losing a loved one is tough, Bishop Antonio Tobias urged everyone to draw strength from their struggles.
""Ang nakaraan, mga nangyari, ay nakaraan na. Ibig sabihin, gusto ng Panginoon daanan mo 'yan. Daanan natin lahat ng ating mga pangkasalukuyan na mga pagsubok sapagkat diyan lamang lalakas ang inyong kalooban,"" he said.
(What is past is past. The Lord wants you to go through that. Let us persevere amid all the challenges because it is through them that we will find strength.)
During Tobias' homily, he also assured the victims' families that the Catholic Church is listening to the cries of the poor.
""Sa totoo hindi naman kayo nag-iisa. Nandito ang mga kapatid ninyo. Alam 'nyo itong ginagawa natin (church workers) ngayon, nakakapagbigay dapat ng lakas ng loob. 'Yan po ang diwa ng isang Kristiyano – 'di ka nagiisa,"" he added.
(You are not alone. All your brothers and sisters in faith are with you. This gathering should help strengthen your resolve. That is the essence of being a Christian – you are not alone.)
MOVE FORWARD. 'There is no easy way in moving on, only with the help of God,' Bishop Antonio Tobias tells the bereaved families.

Recently, the National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, known as the Baclaran Church, generated buzz on social media after temporarily replacing the INRI inscription on a crucifix with ""Stop the killings"" written on a piece of cardboard. (LOOK: Baclaran Church reminds faithful Jesus was an EJK victim too)
Last July, the Diocese of Caloocan joined the Walk for Life. They marched from San Ildefonso Parish to the Church of San Jose de Navotas to pray for victims, similar to the Walk for Life attended by around 10,000 people in Manila back in February.
Duterte has repeatedly slammed the Catholic Church, saying it should help address the country's drug problem instead of criticizing the anti-drug campaign. The Church, in fact, has been handling drug rehabilitation programs, such as one in Bulacan that has been running for more than two decades.
""Laban sa droga – kaya may namamatay diyan kasi laban 'yan eh, labanan. Pero para sa ating mga Kristiyano, ang buhay ay labanan pero dapat walang namamatay. Iyan ang ating ipakikita sa ngayon,"" Tobias said.

In the United States and its former colony, the Philippines, extrajudicial killings – long practiced but often swept aside – have recently become the norm.  
Is it possible to think comparatively, which is to say critically, about the connection between these two regimes of extra-judicial killings thousands of miles away: the police execution of black citizens and other peoples of color in the US on the one hand and the Presidentially-mandated, police and vigilante incited and performed executions of purported drug dealers and drug addicts in the Philippines on the other?
In the US, the targeting of black bodies has a very long history. It is rooted in centuries of racialized slavery, segregation and settler colonialism productive of and sustained by an ideology of white supremacy. The history of these practices and ideology continue to be deeply entrenched and institutionalized in militarized modes of policing which have emerged since the 1970s in response to urban insurgencies in US cities. Indeed, the history of policing in America has its roots in slave patrols – bands of armed white men employed by slave holders to keep blacks in check and search for runaways – as well as a long history of local codes designed to criminalize the mere presence of Native American and immigrants of color in urban areas. The system of discriminatory policing is also sustained by a vast prison-industrial complex. The criminal justice system in the US disproportionately incarcerates and disenfranchises people of color, placing them under constant surveillance even when they are released from prison. 
The climate for extrajudicial killings has been further stoked by the ready availability of assault rifles and other high-powered guns. Thanks to the lobbying efforts of Second-Amendment fundamentalists such as the NRA and the gun industry, the US now has a heavily armed citizenry. This volatile combination of racism and guns has literally triggered the recurring murder of black people by police forces and, more recently as in Dallas, the occasional armed response by a lone black gunman. 
Mostly poor
In the Philippine case, things are, of course, different. 
The targets of extrajudicial killings are mostly poor. Those who are influential and wealthy are publicly accused but held off from execution and subject to investigation, such as the police generals named by President Duterte. For the poor, however, there is no due process. Suspicion or accusation is warrant enough to kill them. Their bodies are displayed, at times with signs, for everyone to see as both warning to other dealers and as marks of the will of a sovereign power, as in any public execution. Terrorizing ordinary citizens, the display of their corpses are ways for the regime to claim for itself the power of their enemies and project this power to the people. 
What about the comparative responses to extrajudicial killings? 
In the US, anti-racist movements such as Black Lives Matter arise to protest the killings. They draw on a long history of civil rights activism that appeal to liberal democracy even as they are critical of its discriminatory application. Media debates are intense, and the conservative press aside, there is a real debate to recast issues and put forth solutions both on the local and national level. And the US being an imperial power, it is not uncommon that racist violence at home are often linked to racist warfare abroad, and more generally the racializing inequities of global capitalism. Hence, many have pointed out the irony of President Obama denouncing both the police murders of blacks even as he presides over a kill-list of suspected terrorists in the Middle East targeted for drone assassination. The use of a robot to kill the alleged assassin of Dallas cops during a Black Lives Matter demonstration shows how the counter-terrorist weaponry used abroad has come home to roost in the US cities. 
HUMAN RIGHTS. The Philippines is one of the worst places for human rights defenders, 32 of whom were killed in 2015.

In the Philippines, social movements have yet to emerge questioning extrajudicial killings.
While some Senators and human rights advocates raise objections, no one wants to be seen as coddling or protecting those who are killed. The communist Left and its allies have so far remained circumspect over these killings in an attempt to solidify their coalition with Duterte. Some of the armed groups have even acted as vigilantes to carry out killings in the provinces. Everyone, or at least most everyone, thus assumes that those who are killed are guilty and their innocence need not be proved. They are dead because they deserve to be dead according to this solipsistic populism. They have forfeited their rights, and due process would simply be a waste of time and resources, according to this logic, since courts are corrupt and drug dealers, armed with lots of cash, will simply bribe their way out of prosecution. 
Unlike the US, victims of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines start out as being racially or ethnically identical with their perpetrators. But being associated with illegal drugs renders them into a different race altogether: one deserving neither human recognition nor humane treatment. They become in the eyes of the President, the police and vigilantes, pieces of garbage polluting society and so needing to be cleared away. Their corpses then become surfaces which serve as living signs of an ominous power capable of overcoming the power of death itself.
In both the US and Philippines cases, there is thus a process of racialization that takes place. In the US, it entails the ""blackening"" or “browning” of bodies tantamount to their criminalization and the necessary prelude for the police to render summary judgment as to who shall live and who shall die. But the response to police violence and white supremacy is loud and swift: wide-spread opposition develops, calls are made for reform and the prosecution of guilty police, academic analysis and policy debates ensue. Even if it seems like little changes, the political and ethical stakes of opposing racialized extra-judicial killings are clear. The ready availability of cell phones to record killings have further given citizens an important tool for raising awareness and providing proof of these police murders.  
In the Philippines, again, nothing of this sort has or is likely to happen.
Poor people, to begin with, have few rights that the middle class or the wealthy are compelled to recognize. From the perspective of the latter, the poverty of the former is not related to the wealth of those above; the causes of their destitution are rarely traced to the privilege of the rich; and their tendency to turn to crime, including the dealing and consumption of illegal drugs, are disconnected from any understanding of their immiseration and the precariousness of their daily lives. Historically excluded from the liberal elite democracy inherited from nationalist ilustrados, the poor exist to be exploited, their votes bought, their labor used up, their sufferings patronized and made into the material for soap operas and political sloganeering. Small wonder then that they can be easily racialized: set aside as less than human and casually killed, their deaths weighing less than a centavo on the heads of those above. By subsuming the poor as a separate race, the class-based violence of the state is also tinged with racist intent. 
But what about the poor themselves? What is their understanding of extrajudicial killings?
I'm not sure and I’m not aware of much research on this topic—an absence which is itself telling of the seriousness, or lack of it, with which their views are taken by the political and cultural intelligentsia. But we can guess at some of the reasons why they stand by while the killings occur. Perhaps some support the President and the police, seeing drug dealers as non-humans with little or no rights. Perhaps they have been victimized by dealers themselves, suffering their extortions and violence. Indeed, some of those targeted have been corrupt cops known for taking bribes and selling drugs. One can imagine how their execution might seem like just deserts to those who knew them. 
No doubt, the poor are also fearful of intervening directly. Bereft of resources, they feel their disenfranchisement and vulnerability on the most practical level. Rather than confront state authorities, many opt for a variety of traditional tactics to negotiate with them—from bribes to compliance, from collaboration to flight, though very rarely do the poor resort to assassination and other violent—and riskier--forms of retaliation against the police. In short, they will do anything to deflect the full force of those above while inflecting that force towards maximizing their chances for survival. 
In any case, the seeming passivity, maybe even consent, of the poor to extrajudicial killings remains a real puzzle. The relative absence of collective class-based response occurs amid the sharp and finely developed sense of class-consciousness whereby the poor have a deep understanding of what it means to be poor.
This gap between action and consciousness is undoubtedly common in many places and among other classes. But in the context of extrajudicial killings aimed specifically at the poor, it stands in stark contrast to the strength of anti-racist discourse and resistance in the US. Such a contrast deserves further study. –Rappler.com

The Mr and Ms PUP Engineering pageant had sparked outrage online after candidates posed for a photo shoot that had extrajudicial killings as the theme. The pictures were uploaded via Facebook album, and have since been deleted.
The organizers have said sorry to those who were offended, and explained that they only wanted to raise awareness of the spate of killings in the country.
In a statement sent to media on Thursday, PUP College of Engineering dean Guillermo Bernabe also apologized on behalf of the college.
""We offer our apologies to the families of the victims of extrajudicial killings. The Mr and Ms College Engineering pageant has been already canceled until further notice,"" Bernabe said.
He added that while the students ""had the best intentions in their #EmbraceYourFlaws photo shoot,"" they were unable to deliver their message well.
The candidates who posed as victims of extrajudicial killings had cardboard signs next to them, showing their ""flaws"" or ""insecurities."" Real victims often have cardboard signs as well, claiming they are drug pushers or drug users.
""As a university that hones its students to be socially aware and critical, we believe that matters like extrajudicial killings shall not be downplayed to just a theme in a pageant's shoot,"" Bernabe said.
""This experience has helped the College of Engineering be more responsible and keen-sighted on the topics that we will highlight in our future events.""
Since President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs began on July 1, 2016, there have been 7,080 deaths recorded. Of this figure, 2,555 were killed in police operations, while the rest were victims of vigilante-style or unexplained killings.
The spate of killings in the country has been condemned both here and abroad, including by the United Nations, the European Parliament, the United States, and the International Commission of Jurists. (READ: Cops are paid to kill in PH war on drugs – Amnesty Int'l) – Rappler.com"

Some families marked the annual Filipino event a couple of days earlier, and in a different way.  On Monday afternoon, October 30, families of victims of drug-related deaths gathered at the Most Holy Trinity Parish in Sampaloc, Manila, to share their stories and dedicate prayers for their slain loved ones. 
The ""Padasal Para sa mga Pinaslang: Undas ng Kababaihan (Prayer vigil for the slain: All Saints' Day of Women),"" organized by women's group Baigani, aims to support families who experienced similar traumatic events.
Artists read poems and sang songs influenced by the culture of impunity that those in the room experienced. 
Lea (not her real name), a resident of Camarin, Caloocan, said the group has become her new family after she lost her husband, who was summarily executed last year.
The first few months after his death were the hardest, Lea said, as neighbors judged and ignored her. ""I almost went insane, that I even thought of ending my life, as well as my children's, to end our misery,"" she said.
She now draws strength from her fellow widows. “For the first time, I am able to speak without others judging me. I am with people who understand me.” 
Women warriors
CANDLES FOR THE DEAD. Candles are lit around an outline of a body of a man.

This kind of isolation from their own communities is one reason Baigani was created as a group for ""women warriors,"" according to activist nun Sister Mary John Mananzan.
The traumatic experience of the families of EJK victims is “comparable to none,” Mananzan said. “The only people who could comprehend your pain are the same people who experienced it.” 
With Baigani’s partnership with parishes and other support groups, the widows and mothers are provided with free therapy sessions and legal assistance. 
Katherine Bacani, whose husband was killed in a police operation in August 5, 2017, said a lot of her fellow widows were in tears when she shared her husband's story, as if they were reliving their own experiences.
The women in the group eventually became her friends. “Now we can joke around and talk about things other than our trauma,” Katherine said.

As night fell, all of the women were given candles to be placed in front of the altar as the names of the victims were recited. Volunteers and supporters also lit candles and prayed for victims. 
Behind the lit candles was a glass box filled with yellow chicks feeding on grains, traditionally placed on top of the coffin of a crime victim. It is said that the pecking of the chick would nudge the perpetrators' conscience. 
Activist and actress Mae Paner, popularly known as “Juana Change,” joined the lighting of candles after performing a monologue about a widow and Zumba instructor – inspired by a woman’s real life experience. 
Katherine lit hers for her husband, Adolfo, and the husbands and sons of her newfound friends. 
Although justice is still elusive, Katherine feels that they have attained a bit of it from the outpouring of love they have received from strangers.

Her father is Vicente de Lima, former Commission on Elections commissioner.
The agonies of the families, she said, should serve as a reminder that Filipinos should look out for one another. She then urged the public to pray for ""deliverance from fear and intimidation and from the sins that plague our country.""

In the same message, De Lima reiterated her call to end the killings amid the Duterte administration's intensifed war on illegal drugs.
""So on this day and all the days henceforth, let us do our part to end these killings and allow the mighty stream of the rule of law and justice flow. The fight will not be easy because we are up against the idea that it is fine to kill in the name of war against drugs,"" De Lima said.
The senator said the upcoming visit of UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard is the nation's chance to stand its ground for justice and truth ""until extrajudicial killings are finally put to rest."" (READ: UN expert gets Duterte invite to probe killings)
The senator made the statement as the Philippine National Police aims to nab over 300,000 drug targets by the end of the year.  The PNP has listed as its ""target and end result"" over 334,137 individuals from drug watchlists until December 2016. (READ: Caught in the middle of the drug war)
De Lima and Duterte have long been at odds over the issue of human rights. As former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, De Lima investigated Duterte's alleged links to the Davao Death Squad (DDS). The probe went on when she became justice secretary.
She drew the ire of Duterte anew after she launched a Senate investigation into the spate of extrajudicial killings under his administration.
De Lima was ousted as chairperson of the Senate justice committee after she presented witness Edgar Matobato, a self-confessed hitman of the DDS, who accused Duterte of ordering killings when he was city mayor.
The panel, in its initial findings, said neither Duterte nor the state sponsored the killings and that there is no evidence that the death squad exists. – Rappler.com

A police officer who tried but failed to pacify Piñar ended up shooting him dead, the South China Morning Post reported.
Netizens slammed Duterte for giving the shoot-to-kill order and his government’s overall approach to curb the spread of the coronavirus that has left several poor families hungry and unable to cope with the economic impact of the community quarantine measures.
Duterte has a proclivity for giving such orders. In his administration’s war against illegal drugs, he has repeatedly encouraged police to shoot dead drug suspects who would resist arrest.
Human rights lawyer Chel Diokno has taken up the cudgels for families of the victims of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration.
Diokno said in an episode of Rappler Talk aired on Saturday, April 4, that the “use of deadly force is really meant to be as a last resort.” (WATCH: Rappler Talk: Chel Diokno on the Rule of Law in a pandemic)
“Someone who would be arrested could be subdued without having to use a firearm,” Diokno said.

June 30, 2020 signals not just President Rodrigo Duterte’s 4th year in power, but also another year without justice for the thousands killed in his anti-illegal drugs campaign.
It will be exactly 1,003 days since Nanette Castillo’s son, Aldrin, was mercilessly killed in Tondo, Manila. Since October 2, 2017, Nanette has desperately tried to fill in the void left when unidentified gunmen asked Aldrin to kneel before shooting him twice in the head and twice in the torso.
More than two years may have passed but the details remain vivid as ever for Nanette. She remembers her daughter’s frantic voice on the other line, the one-hour commute to the scene of the crime, and seeing her son’s lifeless and bloodied body slumped on the road.  
The pain and grief will never go away, Nanette said, but they are fueling her quest for justice. She has since joined protest movements, engaged with other grieving mothers and widows, and has openly talked in public against the violent drug war.
“Nagpahayag na agad ako ng matinding galit at paghingi ng hustisya,” she said. “Ang motivation ko, hindi katanggap-tanggap na ginawa nila sa anak ko.” 
(I voiced out my anger and call for justice almost immediately. I am motivated by the unacceptable deed they did to my son.) 
JUSTICE. Nanette Castillo remembers her son Aldrin.

Nanette told Rappler that fear will always be there. Her family fears for her life. Distant relatives, all supporters of the administration, already told her to stop because it will not lead to anything. Even other families of victims, whom she’d talked to, are afraid.  
“Mahal na mahal ko ang anak ko at hindi ako papayag na ganyan na nga nangyari sa kanya tapos makakalimutan pa ng mga tao, na walang hustisya para sa kamatayan niya,” she said. “Palagi siyang nasa puso at isip ko kaya alam ko na gusto niyang ilaban ko siya.” 
(I love my son so much and given what has happened, I will not allow him to be forgotten by people and to have no justice for his death. He’s always in my heart and mind, I know that he wants me to fight for him.) 
On the legal side, there has been not much progress for Aldrin’s case. His death remains to be one of the thousands that are yet to be solved, if the investigation was even started in the first place. 
According to Nanette, the only document she has is the spot report.
“Nilakad ko iyong police report, hindi sila willing ibigay kahit ano,” she said. “Marami silang dahilan, sinasabihan ako pumunta na lang sa madaling-araw kasi ganyang oras naka-duty ang investigator ko, sinong magiging panatag ang loob na pumunta doon nang ganoong oras?”  
(I tried to get the police report, they weren’t willing to give anything. They gave many reasons and they told me to just go past midnight because that’s when the investigator is on duty. Who will be comfortable going to a police station at that time?) 
Nanette’s experience with police officers is similar to thousands of others. Uncooperative police officers are usually the first hurdle that families face in trying to get justice for their loved ones.  
Even the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), mandated by the 1987 Philippine Constitution to investigate state abuses, faces a blank wall when it comes to dealing with the PNP. 
The promised opening of police reports, or even at least spot reports, never materialized despite numerous letters of request.
“Lackluster ang cooperation nila sa amin (Their cooperation with us is lackluster),” CHR Investigation Office Director Jasmin Regino told Rappler. “They have a number of ways to decline our requests.” 
The lack of information-sharing and access to important documents proved to be a challenge. It’s like “looking for a needle in a haystack,” Regino said, since they start with nothing. They get a tip, but they will not be able to probe further.  
CHR’s special investigators sometimes have to employ their own techniques in probing. In some cases, they resort to just taking photos of documents they need after negotiating with the police. 
STOP ABUSES. The Commission on Human Rights faces challenges in doing its mandate against state abuses.

The Commission also partners with several civil society organizations, faith-based groups, and even barangay human rights action officers for documentation purposes. 
“Kung ayaw man kami bigyan ng copies ng reports ng kapulisan, at least may makukuha kaming information from our partners on the ground,” Regino said. ""More or less, meron na kaming panghahawakan so we can deploy our special investigators.”
(If the police don’t give us reports, at least we can get information from partners on the ground. More or less, we have some information so we can deploy our special investigators.) 
Non-cooperation of law enforcers, together with the Commission’s lack of manpower resources, proved to be a challenge in pursuing justice for the victims of Duterte’s war on drugs.  
The violent campaign has claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in police operations, while human rights groups estimate the number to reach at least 27,000, to include vigilante killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
But CHR has investigated only 3,101 cases – 1,803 were killed in police operations while 1,298 were killed vigilante-style.
The Commission has so far referred 96 cases to other government bodies while 7 are set to be filed soon: 
CHR also has archived at least 500 cases already due to lack of evidence or other vital information that could move it forward. 
But Regino said that archiving a case is not the end, it just means that it will be parked until more evidence come in, or a witness comes forward.  
“Even victims' families, they refuse to cooperate with us because of the climate of fear kasi raw baka raw babalikan sila (since they fear reprisal),” she said. “Kahit kami tumutulong na, marami talaga ang takot at ayaw talaga magsalita (Even if we're helping them already, a lot are still scared and don’t want to speak).”
Regino recalled families who reported being harassed by local authorities, or felt that they were being monitored when they reached out to CHR. This usually leads to them refusing to further cooperate with investigators, or withdraw the case altogether.  
Still, despite the small number of families going forward, Regino said CHR continues to monitor and document everything that’s happening. The prescription period for murder or homicide, after all, is 20 years, according to the Revised Penal Code. 
“May mga pamilya kasi na because of the political landscape, ayaw nila mag-file for now,” she said. “Kapag nag-iba na lang daw ang presidente because of the climate of fear, it really boils down to the climate of fear and reprisal.”  
(There are families who say they don't want to really file anything for now because of the political landscape. Maybe when there’s a different president already because of the climate of fear. It really boils down to the climate of fear.) 
The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a report released on June 4, said that there is a “failure of domestic mechanisms to ensure accountability thus far.” (DOCUMENT: U.N. Human Rights report on killings, abuses in PH)
An analysis by Rappler also found that the Duterte administration has allowed thousands of killings to go unsolved, mainly due to systematic gaps at the police and prosecutorial levels. 
Lawyer Krissy Conti knows all too well how the climate of fear and impunity blocked justice for many victims. It has manifested in the judicial process, too.
“Natatakot ka kasi puwede ka balikan, natatakot ka kasi hindi mapaparusahan iyong gumawa ng masama sa kapamilya mo, natatakot ka kasi iyong ‘justice’ na makukuha mo would be incomplete at hindi naman talaga makukulong,” she told Rappler. 
(You’re afraid that they will get back at you, you’re afraid that the ones who wronged your next of kin will not be punished, you’re afraid that the justice they will give is incomplete and won’t even jail the perpetrators.)
“If you're going against government policy, then it’s so sure that every stage of the prosecutor or the legal aspect, meron kang kalaban (you will have to face an enemy),” Conti added.
She said there is “a little bit of a glimmer of hope” in local courts. But it takes a long time. 
For example, Conti pointed out a case she’s handling that’s taken close to 3 years already, in the same Caloocan court that convicted the killers of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos – the first conviction of abusive cops in Duterte’s drug war.
“Ang napansin namin (we’ve noticed), if you put public pressure and the public eye on cases, judges will be more critical,” she said.
JUSTICE. Families of victims of extraudicial killings call on international mechanisms against the drug war killings.

As member of the NUPL, Conti has been at the forefront helping families of drug war victims explore the avenues where they can seek justice. (READ: Lawyers do dirty groundwork to fight Duterte’s drug war)  
She understands the fear of families, of lawyers, of those involved in the legal process. But she highlights also the courage of mothers, of widows, who come together to seek justice for their slain loved ones.  
Since December 2016, Conti has been assisting the Rise Up for Life and Rights, a group composed of families left behind. She recalled that mothers and widows help each other determine what cases are ripe for filing or what still needs some further documentation. 
“Every time a mother files a case, she is backed up by other mothers and other families,” she said. “It’s never going to be about one victim, one family, it’s going to be about the community.” 
Rise Up for Life and Rights brought its quest for justice to the International Criminal Court (ICC), after Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced that her office is opening a preliminary investigation into the drug war killings. 
In August 2018, the group submitted to Bensouda a 50-page complaint in which they ""call for an end to madness and for President Duterte, who has likened himself to one of the most evil men in history, to be brought before the ICC and be held to account for crimes against humanity.""
The families' quest for justice has now gone beyond their sons and husbands. They did not want what happened to their loved ones happen to others.  
The international court’s move has struck a chord. Duterte withdrew the Philippines’ membership from the ICC, aside from publicly lambasting Bensouda.  (READ: Duterte throws out decade-long fight for the International Criminal Court) 
But the withdrawal will have no effect on ongoing proceedings at the ICC. According to Bensouda, her office aims to finalize the preliminary examination in 2020 so they “reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines.”
There is still no hint of what will happen. But for Conti, what sets the possible case with the ICC from international condemnation is that there’s a “real threat of arrest for Duterte.” 
“Even if we say that the ICC has actually carried out only a few arrests, there is still a possibility that it could happen to Duterte,” she said. “Liliit ang mundo niya, even that slight chance na makulong siya, I think that jars him.” 
(His world will become smaller. Even that slight chance of going to jail, I think that jars him.)

On Wednesday, June 24, Nanette Castillo commemorated the 997th day since Aldrin was killed. She rearranged the existing small corner dedicated to her son. Strips of LED lights surround the frames, illuminating photos of Aldrin whose smile is now a distant memory. 
Posting this development on Facebook, Nanette wrote: ""Nais kong palaging may ilaw ang mga larawan nya mapa araw man o gabi! Lalaging may puwang si Aldrin sa bahay at sa puso namin at iyon ang hindi nila kayang kunin sa akin."" (I want his photos to be illuminated day and night. Aldrin will always have a place in our home and hearts, and that's something they can never take away from me.)
In about 4 months, Nanette will mark Aldrin’s 3rd year death anniversary. Her son’s killers remain unidentified but she hasn't lost hope.
There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the case of her son. One thing Nanette is sure of: in one way or another, justice will catch up with Duterte and other government officials complicit in the drug war.
“Hindi ko siya kaya ipasa-Diyos, although nagdadasal ako palagi na sana mabigyan siya ng hustisya, hindi ko kaya ipabahala na lang kay Lord,” she said. “Kailangan ko talaga kumilos.”

Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales announced this on Tuesday, August 29, after a Senate budget hearing on her office's proposed 2018 budget. (READ: Can Ombudsman take over Kian case?)
""We already started our fact-finding investigation. The Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (MOLEO) of Ramos is here. He has already started the fact-finding investigation,"" Morales told reporters in an interview, referring to Deputy Ombudsman Cyril Ramos who heads the MOLEO.
Morales also said they have already started sending out subpoenas for documents and witnesses.
Police shot Delos Santos for allegedly fighting back during an anti-drug operation. CCTV footage and witnesses' testimonies, however, indicate that the boy was a victim of an extrajudicial killing.
Ballistic tests show the bullet found inside Delos Santos' body came from the gun of PO3 Arnel Oares, who led the raid. Delos Santos, meanwhile, tested negative for gunpowder.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said he talked to Morales, who supposedly confirmed that her office has indeed ""concurrent jurisdiction"" over Delos Santos' case, as it involves government officers with a salary grade below SG27.
""The Ombudsman has confirmed that she has concurrent jurisdiction with the DOJ (Department of Justice) insofar as Kian's killing is concerned. But, because of the MOA (memorandum of agreement), it's the DOJ that's assuming jurisdiction. She is, in fact, conducting a fact-finding investigation on the same case, on a number of issues,"" Drilon said.
In the Senate probe into the teenager's death, Drilon slammed Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II for his ""bias"" and asked Aguirre if he would be willing to have the case transferred to the Ombudsman.
Aguirre, however, rejected the proposal because it might make the DOJ look ""incompetent"" and incapable of conducting an impartial probe. (READ: Aguirre: What's the difference between kids killed by addicts, cops?)
""If [the] Ombudsman can conduct [a] preliminary investigation on impeachable officials, how much more ordinary policemen? So that only indicates the erroneous interpretation of the secretary (Aguirre) in the desire to just assume jurisdiction over the investigation,"" Drilon said. 
On Tuesday, a formal petition was filed before the DOJ seeking its inhibition from conducting a preliminary investigation into the murder and torture complaints against Caloocan City cops.
""The Office of the Ombudsman is the best forum to conduct the preliminary investigation for this case given the impartiality of this constitutionally-mandated body,"" said the petition. – Rappler.com

Duterte's statements on killing drug users,,"MANILA, Philippines – It has been a common refrain between the government and its critics: the latter decries President Rodrigo Duterte's ""shoot-to-kill"" orders against alleged drug users, while the former denies there ever was such a thing. 
As human rights groups, international media, and diplomats begin to take increasing notice of the number of drug-related deaths in the Philippines, it comes with criticism against what they perceive as the government's tacit endorsement of extrajudicial killings.
The harrowing images have been splashed across international news outlets: photos of slain people with their faces wrapped in tape, usually beside a cardboard sign saying: ""I'm a drug pusher, do not emulate me.""
But the relatives of some of the victims insist that their loved ones did not fit the profile of a drug user, or were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
One US senator said Duterte was endorsing ""what amounts to mass murder."" Human rights groups point out that vigilantes have grown emboldened because of Duterte's many statements defending and even promoting the killing of alleged drug users who fight back.
Even before the start of the campaign period for the May 2016 polls, Duterte had already promised to order the killing of criminals. But he emphasized that this should only be done if they fight back.
This caveat has been the government's consistent defense against criticism that it endorses extrajudicial killings.
Shoot to kill, DIY arrests
Duterte has long been vocal about his hardliner stance against illegal drugs. His campaign threats to kill drug users, he said, were not rhetorical.
Several months since the May polls, the Philippines is seeing the concrete evidence of that statement: thousands have been killed in Duterte's bloody war on drugs, some of them under questionable circumstances. (READ: 'Nanlaban sila': Duterte's war on drugs)
In May, shortly after winning the elections, Duterte said he would give security forces ""shoot to kill"" orders against those who resist arrest. 
He also said he would offer million-peso bounties for the capture or death of drug lords.  
But he was quick to add: ""I'm not saying you kill them but the order is 'dead or alive.'""
The President has made several pronouncements in the same vein, issuing shoot-to-kill orders but immediately clarifying that it should only be done if the suspects resist arrest.
He has made this call not only to law enforcers, but to ordinary citizens. In June, during a thanksgiving party in Davao City, Duterte endorsed the idea of ordinary civilians engaging in do-it-yourself arrests.
""Kayong nandiyan sa neighborhood ninyo (Those among you in your respective neighborhoods), feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourself if you have the gun, you have my support,"" he said.
If a suspect resists arrest, ""you can kill him,"" Duterte said.
The President added, ""Only if your life is in danger, at lumaban, at may baril din at kutsilyo, barilin mo (and there is resistance and the suspect is armed with a gun or knife, shoot). I'll give you a medal."" 
'Layered' messages?
Aside from issuing shoot-to-kill orders, Duterte has vowed to protect the policemen who do their duty, even if they kill a thousand people in the course of their work.
""Do not bullshit with me but do your duty, I will die for you. Do your duty and if in the process you kill 1,000 persons because you were doing your duty, I will protect you,"" he said in July. 
That message was said even during the campaign period, when Duterte said he would pardon policemen convicted of killing criminals and civilians while performing their duties. 
In August, the President acknowledged that some of those killed in the war on drugs were victims of extrajudicial killings. 
He then echoed the police's defense, insisting that those killed in police operations all fought back. 
In September, however, Duterte's message took on a different tone. In contrast to his earlier pronouncement that only those who resist arrest should be killed, this time, Duterte told soldiers that criminals should be killed whether or not they fight back. 
""Pagka bumunot, patayin mo. 'Pag hindi bumunot, patayin mo rin, putang ina, para matapos na. Eh kaysa mawala pa 'yung baril. Ako na ang bahala sa inyo,"" he said. 
(If they pull out a gun, kill them. If they don't, kill them still, son of a whore, so it's over, lest you lose the gun. I'll take care of you.)
But it's unclear whether the President meant it, because he would later flip-flop on his own statement by saying he would never order the military to commit illegal acts.
""Hindi ako mag-order ng illegal. 'Wag kayong maniwala diyan. (I won't order anything illegal. Don't believe that.) I did not order you and the police to perform punitive police action. I have declared war against the drug syndicates in this country. You know what is war. War is war,"" he said.
Asked about the President's conflicting messages, Abella said Duterte's remarks are ""layered.""
But this shoot-to-kill order has been slammed by critics, including Senator Leila de Lima. De Lima, a former justice secretary and former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, said that such an order should only be a last resort of law enforcers.
Senator Panfilo Lacson also agreed with De Lima, saying that shoot-on-sight or shoot-to-kill orders not used for self-defense would be murder. 
Killings 'not a gov't policy'
In the face of mounting criticism over the death toll in the war on drugs, Malacañang has defended itself by saying that extrajudicial killings are not a policy of the Duterte government. 
""Notwithstanding the accusations hurled against him, no formal charge of human rights violations has been filed. Alleged EJKs (extrajudicial killings) are not the policy of his administration,"" Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said last month.
Abella also told the United Nations that Duterte, as a lawyer and former prosecutor, ""knows the limits of the power and authority of the presidency."" 
Various groups, such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), pointed out however that Duterte's statements constitute an ""implicit"" support of killings in violation of the rule of law.
""Duterte implicitly voiced support for such unlawful brutality by stating that police can rightly put illegal drug suspects 'below the ground' if necessary,"" HRW's Phelim Kine said.
He added, ""President Duterte must publicly recognize that respect for rule of law and fulfilling the human rights of Filipinos extends to all Filipinos, including criminal suspects and those implicated in the drug trade.""
Should the President's statements be interpreted as a tacit approval of drug-related killings? In his public statements, Duterte is careful to add that killing should be done only if necessary. But with 2,294 victims of extrajudicial killings as of latest figures – and with investigations into these deaths still pending – these drug-related killings remain a cause for concern for the Philippine government. – Rappler.com"

""Tama na po 'yang declaration sa media. Kung talagang may banta, gamitin ang mga remedyo at mayroon tayong writ of amparo,"" Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said in Palace news briefing.
(Stop making declarations to media. If there is really a threat, use the available remedies like the writ of amparo.)
Picardal, who has lived in seclusion since April and has not approached the media, wrote in a blog post how 6 men on board 3 motorcycles and wearing ""full-faced helmets"" stationed themselves outside a Cebu monastery he visits as part of his routine.
Picardal said that if he had visited the monastery that day, August 11, he could have become ""a victim of extrajudicial killing and the 4th priest to be killed under the Duterte regime had I stuck to my routine.""
Roque, a lawyer, assured Picardal that if he files a writ of amparo, the courts will quickly act on it.
""His remedy is to file a writ of amparo with the Supreme Court. It can be filed in the lower courts and it will be acted upon expeditiously,"" said the presidential spokesman.
The writ of amparo is a legal remedy in which a person or group of persons may obtain a temporary restraining order if their right to life, security, and liberty is threatened or violated by a public official or private entity.
It can be filed, for free, before the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan, or Regional Trial Courts.
The writ is meant to protect persons from abuses by the military and police, and from extrajudicial killings. 
Picardal is no stranger to the issue of extrajudicial killings. As a member of the Coalition Against Summary Executions (Case), Picardal documented killings allegedly carried out by the Davao Death Squad (DDS) when President Rodrigo Duterte was Davao City mayor. Picardal was based in Davao City from 1977 to 1981 and from 1995 to 2011.
The DDS is allegedly responsible for the deaths of at least 1,000 people. Whistleblowers have accused Duterte himself of masterminding or leading the death squad. 
Picardal began his life as a hermit in the mountains in April, after going on a two-week ""Bike for Life and Peace"" around Northern Mindanao where he advocated 3 appeals: end extrajudicial killings, resume peace talks with communist rebels, and lift martial law in Mindanao.  (READ: One last bike trip for the fearless Father Picx) – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Despite fear for their safety, the families of Payatas men killed in the name of the government’s war on drugs have come forward to strengthen evidence against Quezon City policemen in an extrajudicial killing complaint.
They follow the lead of Efren Morillo, friend of their slain relatives who survived the “execution-style killing” and who earlier filed his complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman.
The families filed supplemental affidavits on Thursday, March 16, to bolster Morillo's complaint.
According to lawyer Rommel Bagares, they have monitored around 100 similar cases being handled by other lawyers.
Could this lead to cases that will directly link President Rodrigo Duterte and the Philippine National Police to the murders?
“It requires a deeper investigation,"" Bagares said.""Of course there is the memorandum circular of the police, so we are looking into the elements of the PNP’s memorandum circular ordering TokHang.""
Bagares stressed the importance of paper trail but lamented the police’s lack of cooperation when it comes to providing documents.
Women take the fight
The supplemental complaint filed on Thursday back up Morillo’s accusations of multiple murder, frustrated murder, robbery, planting of firearms, planting of evidence and grave misconduct against police official Senior Inspector Emil Garcia, and policemen PO3 Allan Formilleza, PO1 James Aggarao and PO1 Melchor Navisaga.
They conducted the Oplan TokHang operations and allegedly gunned down the victims while they sat on a bench handcuffed and begging for their lives.
The complainants are Marilyn Malimban, live-in partner of Jessie Cule; Lydia Gabo, mother of Rhaffy Gabo; and Maria Belen Daa, mother of Marcelo Daa Jr. 
Too scared
Apart from Cule, Daa and Gabo, Anthony Comendo also died in the operation but his family is too scared to file a case.
“Apat and biktima dito, may isa pang pamilya ayaw sumama kasi natatakot sila... may pananakot pa rin na nangyayari,” Bagares said.
(There were 4 victims, there’s another relative who should have filed but they didn’t because they were scared. In fact, we think they’re still being subjected to threats and intimidation.)
Bagares added: “Napagalaman ko sa mga kasamahan kong abugado na may dalawang bangkay na tinapon malapit sa bahay ng nanay ni Marcelo Daa, parang threat siya sa mga kliyente namin.”
(We found out that two dead bodies were thrown near the house of Marcelo Daa’s mother as a way of threatening our clients.)
This, even if they had secured a permanent protection order from the Court of Appeals (CA) last February.
Bagares and his colleagues from the Center for International Law (CenterLaw) first sought a writ of amparo from Supreme Court (SC) and later the (CA) precisely because the complainants claimed they were being harrassed by the said policemen.
In granting the writ, the SC and the CA prohibited the cops from going within a 1-kilometer radius from the complainants.
The courts also directed the reassignment of the policemen and ordered the PNP to update the complainants of their investigation into the incident.
'Execution-style killing'
The policemen conducted TokHang operations on August 21, 2016 – a police practice of knocking on doors of suspected drug dealers and pushers to convince them to surrender. Critics said the campaign is a mere cover for executions.
The cops barged into a shanty in Payatas where the five men were playing pool. A 14-year-old witness said the cops took the men to the back of the house and shot them one by one.
“Jessie Cule was the last of the 3 to be killed. He begged to be spared, hugging the legs of one of the armed men and sobbing. As he would not let go of his hold, the man shot him on the nape,"" their petition to the SC reads.
Morillo survived by playing dead and then later sliding down into a ravine and walked until he reached the highway. Morillo is now under the custody of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)
On Tuesday, another murder complaint was filed against Police Superintendent Ali Jose Duterte for the deaths of a drug suspect and his son in a buy-bust operation in Caloocan in September 2016. – Rappler.com

The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) called on the government to intensify efforts to seek accountability for other abuses under President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign.
""We call on the government to step up their efforts in delivering justice for all victims of extrajudicial killings by ensuring that all perpetrators are apprehended and charged,"" CHR Chairperson Chito Gascon said.
Caloocan City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 125 Judge Rodolfo Azucena Jr on Thursday found Police Officer III Arnel Oares, Police Officer I Jeremias Pereda, and Police Officer I Jerwin Cruz guilty for the death of Delos Santos.
They were sentenced to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. (TIMELINE: Seeking justice for Kian delos Santos)
Delos Santos was dragged to a dark alley and shot on August 16, 2017. Police claimed he was armed, but CCTV footage and witnesses revealed that he was defenseless. (READ: Our son, Kian: A good, sweet boy)
Reports from government agencies, including the National Bureau of Investigation, found several irregularities in the police operation.
Warning to other cops
Gascon expressed gratitude to the people who helped secure the first conviction of abusive cops under Duterte's anti-drug campaign.
""We welcome the trial court's conviction of Kian's killers and thank all those who assisted in securing justice in this case – particularly the courageous eyewitnesses, the church workers, and human rights defenders who offered sanctuary, and the investigators and prosecutors who performed their duty,"" he said.
Human Rights Watch (HRW), meanwhile, said the conviction is a sign that law enforcers should stop using power to abuse and violate the rights of citizens.
""This is a triumph of justice and accountability and a warning to members of the Philippine National Police to respect due process and the rights of civilians as they do their job,"" said Brad Adams, HRW Asia director.
He, however, warned of Duterte's previous statements that police would be pardoned if convicted for their actions in line of duty.
""This is why it remains important that the government create an independent commission to investigate these killings,"" Adams said.
""This also underscores the need for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to take further action on the complaints against Duterte,"" he added.
Delos Santos' death triggered condemnation of Duterte's violent anti-drug campaign, which has so far led to nearly 5,000 deaths in police operations. Other minors like Delos Santos have been killed in drug-related circumstances.
The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor is conducting a preliminary examination of the anti-drug campaign to determine if it has jurisdiction over the case in relation to crimes against humanity. – Rappler.com

Delos Santos was dragged to a dark alley and shot on August 16, 2017. Police claimed he was armed, but CCTV footage and witnesses revealed that he was defenseless. (READ: Our son, Kian: A good, sweet boy)
Reports from government agencies, including the National Bureau of Investigation, found several irregularities in the police operation.
Warning to other cops
Gascon expressed gratitude to the people who helped secure the first conviction of abusive cops under Duterte's anti-drug campaign.
""We welcome the trial court's conviction of Kian's killers and thank all those who assisted in securing justice in this case – particularly the courageous eyewitnesses, the church workers, and human rights defenders who offered sanctuary, and the investigators and prosecutors who performed their duty,"" he said.
Human Rights Watch (HRW), meanwhile, said the conviction is a sign that law enforcers should stop using power to abuse and violate the rights of citizens.
""This is a triumph of justice and accountability and a warning to members of the Philippine National Police to respect due process and the rights of civilians as they do their job,"" said Brad Adams, HRW Asia director.
He, however, warned of Duterte's previous statements that police would be pardoned if convicted for their actions in line of duty.
""This is why it remains important that the government create an independent commission to investigate these killings,"" Adams said.
""This also underscores the need for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to take further action on the complaints against Duterte,"" he added.
Delos Santos' death triggered condemnation of Duterte's violent anti-drug campaign, which has so far led to nearly 5,000 deaths in police operations. Other minors like Delos Santos have been killed in drug-related circumstances.
The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor is conducting a preliminary examination of the anti-drug campaign to determine if it has jurisdiction over the case in relation to crimes against humanity. – Rappler.com

Bongbong, the only son and namesake of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, sat on a plush chair facing Enrile, former Marcos defense minister and known architect and implementor of Martial Law. (READ: Martial Law, the dark chapter in Philippine history) 
But the two men made false or misleading claims in their video entitled, ""JPE: A Witness to History,"" a clear attempt to justify Marcos’ Proclamation No. 1081 which placed the whole country under martial rule on September 21, 1972.
Bongbong opened the interview by asking Enrile, “What is the biggest fallacy that young people now are being fed about the reasons behind and the actual events of Martial Law?” (READ: #NeverAgain: Martial Law stories young people need to hear)
CLAIM: “They claimed that we killed a lot of people. That’s why when I was interviewed by someone some time ago, I challenged her: Name me one that we executed other than Lim Seng,” said Enrile. 
Enrile went on to say that it is “not true” that 70,000 people were arrested during the Marcos years, unless that number included ""the people who [violated] curfew and jaywalkers.”
Enrile also said that no one was arrested during Martial Law because of their political or religious beliefs or because they had opposed Marcos. 
“Name me one person that was arrested because of political or religious belief during that period. None…. Name me one person that was arrested simply because he criticized President Marcos. None,” said Enrile.
FACT: During the interview, Enrile was selective about his recollections. He excluded reference to the extrajudicial killings under Martial Law. (READ: FALSE: 'Only one executed,' 'none arrested' under Marcos' Martial Law – Enrile)
""Executed"" as used by Enrile in the interview appears to refer to the imposition of the death penalty by the government as punishment for a crime committed. Extrajudicial killings, which often target those who oppose the government, happen without the sanction of any legal process.

Lim Seng, whom Enrile mentioned in the interview, was executed through firing squad in 1973 because he was a Chinese drug lord. Enrile, however, erred in saying Seng was the only criminal executed by the government, because Canada-based The Ottawa Citizen reported another execution during Martial Law. The report said that on October 31, 1976, Marcelo San Jose was sentenced to death by electrocution.

As for extrajudicial killings, Amnesty International reported at least 3,240 people were killed from 1972 to 1981, while around 70,000 people were imprisoned, and 34,000 were tortured.

The late senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr, one of Marcos’ fiercest critics, was one of the first individuals arrested after Martial Law was proclaimed. (READ: LOOK BACK: The Aquino assassination) 
Aquino was placed under military trial after he was accused of murder, illegal possession of firearms, and subversion. He went on a hunger strike for 40 days from April 4 to May 13, 1975, to protest the “trumped-up charges” against him. 
In 1977, the military tribunal sentenced Aquino to die. The execution, however, was never carried out as Aquino was allowed to live in exile in the US.
Brave young Filipinos at the forefront of the anti-dictatorship movement were also imprisoned and killed during Martial Law. (READ: Gone too soon: 7 youth leaders killed under Martial Law)
Among them is 21-year-old Archimedes Trajano, who stood up during an August 1977 open forum where Bongbong's sister Imee Marcos, now Ilocos Norte governor, was a speaker. Trajano asked why she was the national chairperson of the Kabataang Barangay.
Witnesses said Trajano was seen forcibly taken from the venue by Imee's bodyguards, was tortured for 12 to 36 hours, and thrown out of a second floor window. His bloodied body was found in the streets of Manila on September 2, 1977.
Trajano's mother later sued Imee and former Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Fabian Ver before a district court in Honolulu, Hawaii, on March 20, 1986, about a month after the Marcos family moved there, following the EDSA People Power Revolution that toppled the Marcoses from power.
The Trajanos won the case in 1991, with the court awarding them $4.4 million. They then filed a civil case with the Pasig City Regional Trial Court in 1993 to collect the compensation from the Marcos family.
But in 2006, the Supreme Court voided the case and ruled in favor of Imee and Ver. (READ: How Imee Marcos got away from paying $4M in damages for Trajano death)
Years later, Republic Act (RA) No. 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013 created the Human Rights Victims' Claims Board, tasked ""to receive, evaluate, process, and investigate"" reparation claims made by victims of human rights violations under Martial Law.
Ironically, Enrile was the Senate president when RA 10368 was signed into law.
A total of 11,103 victims of human rights violations under Martial Law are now mandated to receive reparations for the abuses they endured. (READ: House OKs longer validity of Martial Law victims' compensation)
CLAIM: “During Martial Law, there were no massacres, like what happened in Mendiola during the supposed democratic government of Cory Aquino,” said Enrile. 
FACT: There were at least two massacres that happened during Martial Law. (READ: FALSE: 'No massacres' during Martial Law)
On September 24, 1974, military forces in pursuit of rebels from the Moro National Liberation Front gunned down more than 1,000 civilians praying in a mosque in Malisbong, Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat. This is known as the Malisbong massacre or the Palimbang massacre.
Details of a second massacre – the Bingcul massacre – were reported by various  newspapers based in the United States and Canada. On the evening of November 12, 1977, 7 uniformed men were reported to have entered Bingcul village somewhere in Mindanao and ordered 12 families to get out of their houses. 
The uniformed men made them squat then opened fire on them, killing 42 people. One adult and 3 children survived. 
CLAIM: Towards the end of the episode, Bongbong asked Enrile what convinced the government then that Marcos should already declare Martial Law. Enrile claimed the Jabidah massacre was a mere invention.
“It started when they invented the Jabidah massacre. I say invented because until now, I have not heard anyone who complained about anyone being massacred in Corregidor. No one. The only one who appeared as a member of the supposed Muslim trainees in Corregidor was that fellow who swam across Corregidor to Cavite, which was the invention of Montano and Ninoy Aquino. Because of that political outburst of Ninoy, we lost Sabah. That Jabidah massacre injured the political stature of the Marcos regime, followed by the Plaza Miranda grenading in 1971,” said Enrile. 
FACT: The Jabidah massacre happened on March 18, 1968, when at least 23 Muslim trainees were shot to death in Corregidor Island. The Marcos government, however, tried to cover it up. 
The inside story on the massacre was written by Rappler editor-at-large Marites Dañguilan Vitug and Rappler managing editor Glenda Gloria in one chapter of their book, ""Under the Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao,"" first published in 2000.
It all began with Oplan Merdeka, a clandestine operation hatched by Marcos in 1967 that sought the training of a special commando unit – named Jabidah – that would create havoc in Sabah, a territory claimed by the Philippines but occupied by Malaysia.
The plan was to send Muslim recruits to invade Sabah in 1968, but the operation ws botched.
On top of not receiving the stipends promised to them, the trainees had to endure harsh living conditions in Corregidor. They were also reportedly not informed that Oplan Merdeka's real purpose was to invade Sabah. Some of the trainees secretly wrote a petition addressed to Marcos to air their grievances.
Smelling a mutiny brewing, the training officers of the Jabidah unit transferred some recruits to other camps. But on March 18, 1968, some of the trainees were shot and burned – the bloodbath known as the Jabidah massacre.
The massacre sparked the decades-long armed struggle in Mindanao. The Bangsamoro people continue to demand justice for the Jabidah massacre victims to this day. – Rappler.com

Robredo calls it an insult,,"MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday, September 30, said that interpreting President Rodrigo Duterte's admission of extrajudicial killings merely as a joke is an insult to the victims' families.
""Kung nagbibiro man, dapat hindi iyon ginagawang biro. Insulto 'yon. Insulto 'yon sa napakaraming pamilya na naiwan ng mga napatay dahil sa extrajudicial killings,"" Robredo said on her Sunday radio program. (If he was joking, then that should not be treated as a joke. That's an insult. That's an insult to the many families left by those who died because of extrajudicial killings.)
Robredo added that ""it should be taken seriously,"" contrary to the stance of Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. She said that such admission could be used as an evidence for the complaint lodged against Duterte at the International Criminal Court (ICC).
""Hindi mo dapat 'hindi siniseryoso iyon,' dahil maraming buhay iyong nakitil doon… Tapos ngayon, parang sasambitin na parang wala lang? Kung iyon naman ay pagpapahayag ng isang katotohanan, parang sinusuportahan mo iyong kaso sa International Criminal Court, 'di ba?"" she said.
(You should not ""not take it seriously,"" because several lives were lost because of that. Now, it's being treated as if it's nothing? If that was an admission of truth, this supports your case at the International Criminal Court, right?)
Robredo also said that the confirmation that there are extrajudicial killings came from Duterte himself, as other government officials repeatedly refused to admit such killings. (READ: No extrajudicial killings in PH? World 'not fooled,' says HRW) 
""Kasi ano man iyong sabihin ng Presidente, nakaka-influence iyon ng policy. Nakaka-influence ito ng paano ang aksyon ng mga alagad ng batas, ‘di ba? Kapag Presidente iyong nagsabi na patayin iyong mga drug addict, nakita natin na talaga iyong patayan nandiyan,"" Robredo said.
(Whatever the President says, it influence policies. It influences how enforcers implement the law, right? If it was the President who said that drug addicts should be killed, we can see that there were indeed killings.)
Robredo reminded the public that Duterte's pronouncements serve as a declaration of policy, and that words of elected officials come with responsibilities. 
Malacañang, on the other hand, sought to clarify that Duterte's supposed admission to the killings should not be taken seriously. (READ: Not funny: CHR calls out Duterte over extrajudicial killings remark)
Duterte faces complaints for crimes against humanity at the ICC over the thousands killed due to his campaign against illegal drugs. More than 27,800 Filipinos have died in both vigilante-style killings and police operations since the anti-drug campaign was launched in 2016.
With Duterte's fresh statement, human rights groups and opposition lawmakers urged the ICC to hasten the opening of an investigation. ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda is still conducting a preliminary investigation into whether the international tribunal has jurisdiction over the case.
Duterte ordered the withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC, but this move the has been questioned before the Supreme Court. – Rappler.com

Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II assures his fiercest critic, Senator Leila de Lima, of safety if she is detained.
MANILA, Philippines – Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II allayed the fears of Senator Leila de Lima that she might become another victim of an extrajudicial killing if she would be put in jail.
Aguirre assured the senator, the fiercest critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, that she would be protected wherever she will be detained.
""Definitely, she will be safe kung saan man (wherever she is jailed). She will,"" Aguirre told reporters after his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, February 15.
He said he is 99% sure about that. Directly asked if De Lima might get killed, he said: ""Wala naman siguro (I don't think so). I'm sure, 99%.""
Asked for her reaction, De Lima questioned why there is still a 1% chance that she might die in jail.
""Eh di may 1% [chance] pa? Siguraduhin lang 'yung security kasi ano na 'yan eh, foregone conclusion na 'yan ang gagawin nila (So there's still a 1% chance? Security should be guaranteed because what they would do, it's a foregone conclusion),"" De Lima said, referring to the killings.
Expecting her arrest anytime soon, De Lima earlier requested that she be put in a ""safe and secure"" detention place.
She cited the case of former Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr, who was killed while inside a Leyte jail.
""Sakali lang po mangyari na, God forbid, sana ilagay naman ako sa isang lugar na safe and secure ako. Kasi marami na hong nangyayari 'di ba, pinapapatay sa loob ng selda, so what is another EJK?"" De Lima had said.

Tagbilaran City residents and hundreds of visitors from neighboring towns of Bohol province came to light candles, say prayers, and camp around open spaces at the St Joseph Catholic Cemetry, Bohol's biggest public cemetery located in Barangay Dampas, Tagbilaran City.
Security was tight in the area, with police and army troops patrolling the area around the clock.

Undas was relatively peaceful and orderly in the entire Central Visayas, according to the regional police.
“We are happy that the public is cooperating with the police even with the strict security measures we are implementing in cemeteries,” said Police Regional Office (PRO) VII Director Jose Mario Espino.
So far, no major incidents related to the observance of All Saints’ Day were reported in the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, and Siquijor.
In Cebu City, thousands of people trooped to the major cemeteries – the Carreta and Calamba cemeteries – to visit their departed loved ones. Espino said the relatively good weather prompted more people to visit the cemeteries early.
As of noon time, the police have seized bladed weapons, mostly those used in clearing tombs of weeds and plants, and bottles of alcoholic drinks.
Wanted man arrested in Cebu City
At the Carreta Cemetery, the police arrested a 27-year-old wanted man for carrying an unlicensed .38 caliber revolver inside the cemetery undetected by security personnel manning the entrance.
Waterfront Police Station chief Senior Inspector Jovito Labra said a concerned citizen informed the police about the suspect, Rolito Fernandez, who was seen carrying a .38 revolver inside the cemetery.
Labra said Fernandez, whom they found out has an arrest warrant for robbery, was immediately arrested by authorities.
Aside from deploying hundreds of policemen and security personnel at the different cemeteries in Central Visayas, Espino said policemen have also been deployed in various tourist destinations in the region. 
Security measures at Duterte parents' grave
In Davao City, the police have deployed forces to secure the Davao Roman Catholic Cemetery, also known as the Wireless Cemetery, for President Rodrigo Duterte's possible visit to his parents' grave on Wednesday. 
""The President is probably visiting so we've tightened our security there,"" Senior Police Inspector Maria Theresita Gaspan said in a radio interview on Monday, October 30.
""We've also mounted a security plan from road security down to perimeter security,"" added Gaspan.
In 2016, his first Undas as president, Duterte nearly failed to pay respects to his parents' grave due to bad weather.

In a statement, the Rise Up for Life and for Rights network said authorities have a lot of explaining to do over the findings that only 1% of the total supply of illegal drugs in the Philippines has been seized by authorities.
""Napakahina ng PNP (Philippine National Police), akalain 'nyo, nabuwisan ng buhay ang mga dukha, samantalang 1% lang ng total ang nasamsam nilang shabu, iyan ba ang tinatawag nilang tagumpay?"" said Emily Soriano of Rise Up.

(We're demanding a thorough explanation. Why did they sacrifice our children and loved ones, when authorities are practically doing nothing to solve the problem of illegal drugs in the Philippines?)
Robredo on Monday, January 6, called President Rodrigo Duterte's flagship program a ""failure,"" and gave the Duterte government a ""1 out of 100"" score as she released her findings during her 18-day stint as co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs.
Robredo's findings include that authorities were only able to seize less than 1% of the estimated 156,000 kilos of shabu consumed across the country every year. The Vice President also found that the Anti-Money Laundering Council only confiscated P1.4 billion worth of drug money from 2017 to 2018 out of the estimated P1.3 trillion a year. (READ: Here are reforms Robredo wants in Duterte gov't's drug war)
Duterte's war on drugs is widely criticized for the high number of killings. More than 6,000 people have been killed in anti-drug operations by police alone, while human rights groups estimate there may be as many as 27,000 deaths, including victims of vigilante-style killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Soriano said families of victims, Rise Up, and other human rights groups will continue to fight for justice. The Duterte government, she added, must pay its ""bloody debt.""
""Hindi kami titigil hangga't hindi nananagot si Duterte sa pagpaslang ng mga dukha,"" Soriano said. ""Oo, patay na sila at 'di na mababalik ang buhay, pero hustisya lang ang makapagbibigay sa amin ng katahimikan at kapayapaan."" 
(We will not stop until Duterte is made accountable for the killings of the poor. Yes, we cannot bring back the dead, but justice alone can give us peace and quiet.)
For rights group Karapatan, Robredo's report reaffirmed that the war on drugs is anti-poor.
""State policy of mass murder against the poor failed and has been ineffective in curbing the proliferation of illegal drugs and in resolving the root causes of such in the country – at the expense of millions of pesos in government funds and resources and thousands of lives,"" Karapatan secretary-general Cristina Palabay said. – Rappler.com

Kindly view at your own discretion.)
MANILA, Philippines – Liliosa Hilao, or Lilli to friends, was a consistent honor student and scholar of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM). The communication arts student, an active member of different student organizations, was due to graduate cum laude. (READ: '#NeverAgain: Martial law stories young people need to hear')
Her weak health did not stop her from being an active student leader. She was editor-in-chief of HASIK, PLM’s student publication that openly criticized the Marcos administration. Lilli was too sickly to rally on the streets and channeled her strength through her pen, writing thoughtful essays against the dictator’s regime. 
At 23, Lilli made it to history books and publications, but not because of her academic excellence nor her writing talent. She was the first female and student activist to die in detention during martial rule.
Lilli suffered a fate worse than death. 
Drunken soldiers from the Constabulary Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU) beat up Lilli and took her to Camp Crame. She was eventually found dead in the detention center. CANU reported she committed suicide by drinking muriatic acid, but her body showed signs of torture: her lips bore cigarette burns, her arms had injection marks, and her body was full of bruises. According to her sister, her internal organs were removed to cover signs of torture and possible sexual abuse.
Lilli’s tragedy is just one of the many stories of torture during the Marcos regime.
Worse than death
Amnesty International (AI) has estimated that during martial law, 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed. The AI mission, which visited the Philippines from November to December 1975, found that 71 of the 107 prisoners interviewed alleged that they had been tortured. 
Historian Michael Charleston Chua published a study entitled, ""TORTYUR: Human Rights Violations During The Marcos Regime,"" that detailed the different kinds of torture used by authorities during this dark chapter in Philippine history, as recounted by victims and published in different reports. 
According to Chua, here's what physical torture looked like during martial law: 
Electric shock - Electric wires are attached to the victim’s fingers, arms, head and in some cases, genitalia.
San Juanico Bridge - The victim lies between two beds and if his/her body falls, he/she will be beaten. 
Truth serum - An injection administered in hospitals and used for interrogation, making a victim ""talk drunkenly.""
Russian roulette - Loading a bullet into one chamber of a revolver, spinning the cylinder, and then forcing the victim to pull the trigger while pointing the gun at his/her own head. 
Beating - Victim is beaten by a group of soldiers.
Pistol-whipping - The victim is beaten with a rifle butt.
Water cure - Water is forced through the victim’s mouth and then forced out by beating. 
Strangulation - Constriction of the victim's neck done by hand, electric wire, or steel bar.
Cigar and flat iron burns - Victims of torture are inflicted with burns using cigarettes, and even a flat iron.
Pepper torture - A ""concentrated pepper substance"" is put on the victim’s lips or rubbed on his/her genitalia.
Animal treatment - The victim is shackled, caged, treated, and fed like an animal. 
Other forms of torture
Torture during martial law also came in non-physical forms. Chua noted that the regime also inflicted psychological and emotional torture to ""shake one’s principle."" This is done through solitary confinement and isolation. Some reported mental torture by threats of imminent death, rape, and harm to their families. 
Stories of sexual abuse were also prevalent inside detention centers. Women were stripped naked, made to sit on ice blocks, stand in cold rooms, and raped and sexually assaulted using objects such as eggplants smeared with chili peppers. 
The list of different methods of torture recounted by victims go on. (READ: '#AnimatED: Millennial, paano ka apektado ng martial law?' )
Even during martial rule, no amount of censorship nor state control could stop the horror stories from spreading then, as they got more and more atrocious every day. 
Survivors and families left behind by victims of the regime are still haunted by the trauma they and their loved ones suffered at the hands of those who had sworn to protect them. Decades after the Marcos regime, these stories continue to be told, serving as stark reminders of the country's darkest years.
Never again, the victims cry. – Rappler.com "

According to the Caloocan police's consolidated initial investigation report obtained by Rappler, cops were only forced to retaliate during the raid that claimed Delos Santos' life, which was part of the cops' one-time, big-time operation.
As told by PO3 Arnel Oares, it all happened at around 8:45 pm of August 16 with an 11-man team from Caloocan Police Community Precinct 7 (PCP-7) conducting an anti-drug and anti-crime operation at Block 7, Riverside, in Barangay 160.
Oares said they ""divided themselves into groups"" to cover more ground.
Oares, PO1 Jerwin Cruz, PO1 Jeremias Pereda, and a civilian informant formed ""one of the groups that crossed the basketball court."" Other groups were tasked to cover other narrow passages.
Oares and his team entered an alley ""on the right portion"" of the court and ""subsequently turned left.""
In that lane, they were met ""by several male persons who were scampering away after sensing the operation.""
Oares said in the report that they were ""prompted to go after"" the men, starting a chase.
He said they identified themselves as cops but the men did not stop.
As they reached the end of the path, described by Oares as ""a narrow road blocked by a concrete fence bordering Valenzuela City by [the] Tullahan River,"" shots were fired ""from their left side.""
He said the shots got them ducking, but they ""managed to spot the retreating male person.""
Oares then chased the gunman. The cop said he was ""prompted to return fire"" to prevent further aggression, and ended up killing the gunman.
The supposed gunman was Kian Loyd delos Santos.
Kian the family 'drug runner'?
Recovered from the scene were 4 fired cartridge cases, a caliber .45 pistol, and two transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substances believed to be shabu.
The next day, PCP-7 conducted another operation along Tullahan Road, Apple Ville, Barangay 162, resulting in the arrest of a certain Renato Loveras and ""3 other drug personalities.""
Loveras apparently told police that Delos Santos ""receives 10 grams of shabu daily,"" sometimes handed to him by a certain Jeslyn Escopin, daughter of arrested drug suspect Jessie Escopin.
The police report added that a background investigation on Saldy delos Santos, Kian's father, revealed that he was ""involved in criminal activities in the past.""
Despite accusations against the Delos Santos family, however, Metro Manila police chief Director Oscar Albayalde said they are focusing primarily on the allegation that the younger Delos Santos was a victim of an extrajudicial killing.
Based on CCTV footage and eyewitness reports, Delos Santos was unarmed, but given a gun by the police and coerced to run and shoot.
Countering reports
With doubts surrounding the narrative of Oares and his team, they have been placed under the Regional Personnel Holding and Accounting Unit – the unit where cops report daily when they are suspended.
Their supervisor, Police Chief Inspector Amor Cerillo, was also relieved and assigned to the holding unit.
The case of Delos Santos has sparked outrage in the country, with many believing there was foul play.
The cops are facing a probe by the Philippine National Police (PNP) Internal Affairs Service (IAS), but separate investigations are also being conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and Commission on Human Rights (CHR).
Senators allied with President Rodrigo Duterte are also calling for an inquiry into Delos Santos' death and the other recent killings in Duterte's war on drugs. – Rappler.com

Mangahas revealed the finding in an Inquirer column on Saturday, where he said the SWS found in June 2019 that 51% of Filipinos agreed with the statement: ""It is dangerous to print or broadcast anything critical of the administration, even if it is the truth.""
Meanwhile, 20% of Filipinos disagreed with the statement, making for a net +31 perception that it was risky to put out criticism of the administration.
Mangahas also revealed the June 2019 SWS survey showed 67% agreed ""mass media in the Philippines have freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press."" On the other hand, 10% disagreed, he said, making for a net +57 ""affirmation of media’s constitutional guarantee of freedom.""
According to Mangahas, this showed ""that those seeing danger in publicizing criticism of the administration feel personally much freer to dissent (net +57) than those seeing no danger in it (net +24).""
For respondents who agreed with media’s freedom of expression, Mangahas said results showed they ""feel personally very free to dissent (net +56), whereas the few who deny media’s freedom to dissent do NOT feel personally free to do so themselves (net -25).""
Fear in surveys?
Mangahas was responding to former editor and Inquirer columnist John Nery's column last July 30, which raised the question of whether or not ""a climate of fear now colors all surveys.""
Nery highlighted how a December 2018 SWS survey – which found 74% of Filipinos were satisfied with President Rodrigo Duterte's peformance – also showed 78% said they feared they or someone they know would become a victim of an extrajudicial killing.
Nery said this showed SWS should include the survey question every quarter. ""It must explain to the public how, or whether, almost complete administration control over every level of government affects survey-taking,"" he said.
""Duterte supporters and government officials must learn not simply to stand behind the President’s high ratings, but reconcile the difference between public opinion that supports the President and public opinion that consistently expresses deep anxiety over the President’s signature program,"" Nery added.
But Mangahas said SWS assessed respondents' fear not by asking them their fear of being a victim of extrajudicial killings, but by asking them to agree/disagree with the following statement: “I can say anything I want, openly and without fear, even if it is against the administration.""
SWS survey results, he said, showed that under the Duterte administration 5 surveys revealed net ""personal freedom to dissent"" ranged from a moderate +23 to a strong +41.
The question was first introduced in July 1985, during the Marcos dictatorship, in a survey done for the Bishops-Businessmen’s Conference for Human Development. At the time, Mangahas said, personal freedom to dissent was at an all time low of +3 net agreement.
According to Mangahas, the net ""personal freedom to dissent"" under Duterte was not ""unusual"" considering previous presidents like Fidel V Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III showed similar results.
""Freedom of speech has been probed 40 times from 1985 to the present. Its net score averaged +33 during the administration of Cory Aquino, +38 in the time of Fidel Ramos, +41 in the time of Joseph Estrada, +34 in the time of Gloria Arroyo, and +32 in the time of Noynoy Aquino,"" SWS said. 
""From 1986 to now, personal freedom to dissent never returned to single-digit,"" Mangahas added. 
The June 2019 SWS was conducted from June 22-26, 2019 through face-to-face interviews with 1,200 adults nationwide: 300 each in Metro Manila, Balance of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The survey saw a sampling error margins of ±3% for national percentages, and ±6% each for Metro Manila, Balance of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
Filipinos and freedom
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said, the Palace was ""curious as to why"" 51% of Filipinos felt it was dangerous to publish anything critical of the Duterte administration.  
He said: ""The President respects criticisms as long as the same is not baseless, unfounded or false. He even urges the people, including writers and reporters, to freely express whatever sentiments they have.""
On the other hand, he added that the results which showed Filipinos agreed there was press freedom was ""a repudiation of the vociferous and unrelenting tirade of the critics and detractors of the President, as well as the opposition, that the freedoms of speech and of expression are being curtailed by the Administration. The survey rating means we have a vibrant and robust exercise of those freedoms."" 
In a statement Tuesday, August 6, the group Let's Organize for Democracy and Integrity (LODI) said the SWS' survey results attested to ""Filipinos’ love for freedom and their defiance of the regime’s attempts to impose full-scale tyranny. ""
""The oft-peddled claim of massive support for the President’s most oppressive policies crumbles amid the clear findings of the SWS survey: Those who report or express views critical of Duterte face safety issues. Yet those who believe they face clear danger refuse to crumble,"" LODI said.
The group likewise denounced attacks on press freedom such as the red-tagging of journalists, cyberattacks on alternative news websites, Duterte's threats to deny ABS-CBN its franchise renewal, harassment cases filed against Rappler, and the spread of fake news and troll accounts.
LODI added, ""Filipinos continue to exercise their rights by asking questions, expressing themselves and taking direct action. Because that’s what a freedom-loving people do in the face of a rising tyrant allergic of transparency and the breakdown of institutions supposedly holding him accountable."" – Rappler.com

Human Rights report on killings, abuses in PH",,"The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR) on Thursday, June 4, released its comprehensive report on the widespread killings in the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte.
The report said that the ""heavy-handed"" focus of the Duterte government on combating national security threats have led to serious human rights abuses. It added that these were also reinforced by the ""harmful rhetoric"" of government officials.
The report was conducted to abide with a resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which asked UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to write and present the report to the UNHRC 44th Session this June. 
Read the whole report here:
Since assuming office in 2016, Duterte's violent war on drugs has led to at least 6,000 suspected drug personalities killed in police operations, while human rights groups pegged the number to more than 20,000 to include those killed vigilante-style. (READ: The Impunity Series)
The UNHRC resolution in July 2019 also called on the Philippine government to take measures against unnecessary killings, joining both international and local voices that asked for justice and accountability over the thousands of deaths. (READ: Duterte gov't allows 'drug war' deaths go unsolved)

ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE, Philippines – The Diocese of Dipolog has strongly condemned the series of unsolved extra-judicial killings in Zamboanga del Norte, especially in Dipolog City and Sindangan town, and urged the government to act on the cases.
Bishop Severo C. Caermare and priests in the diocese made the statement read in all masses celebrated in the diocese on Sunday, February 1.
“We cannot be at peace and remain indifferent with these occurrences of cases of killings,"" they said.
Caermare, the youngest bishop in the Philippines, leads 71 priests in the diocese. He is known as the motorcycle-riding bishop who draws the faithful wherever he celebrates mass.
“For the people of God especially the families of the victims and those who choose to be silent because of fear, we are at your side, we feel your pain and we are one with you in prayer that justice be attained,” the diocese said in its statement.
The bishop and priests also appealed to the Philippine National Police (PNP), the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), and the Department of Justice (DOJ)  to continue upholding the rule of law and let the “wheels of justice run its course.”
They also urged government officials and all the laity to collaborate to help victims achieve justice and to stop extra-judicial killings, which “desecrate the basic dignity of life, the rule of law and the family.”
Probe
Justice Secretary Leila de Lima had earlier ordered the NBI to look into the spate of killings in the province.
Lawyer Sally Hans C. Barbaso, Agent-in-Charge of the NBI-Dipolog District Office, admitted they were in “limbo” on their investigation until December 5, 2014, when a known drug pusher and police asset, Arthur Barbaso, was, shot to death. 
The victim’s companion, Ronald Realiza – also a drug pusher and police asset – sought NBI protection, claiming that he could be the next target because he saw Barbaso's killer.
Realiza told the NBI that the suspect is a non-regular employee of the Dipolog city government and assigned to work under a group of policemen tasked to fight the proliferation of drugs in the city.
On January 9, the local NBI office submitted to the Dipolog City Prosecutor their investigation report with recommendation for prosecution of the suspect in the killing of  Barbaso, a police officer and 3 John Does.
The NBI investigation report was later sent to the national office of the Justice Department. Almost a month later, Caermare and his priests issued the statement condemning the killings. – Rappler.com "
