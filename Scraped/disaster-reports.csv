LA TRINIDAD, Benguet — Farmer Lolita Acop was fortunate to harvest her green ice lettuce a day before Typhoon “Ompong” (international name: Mangkhut) blew through the vegetable gardens in Benguet province on Saturday.
But her strawberry saplings and funnel-shaped gardens were destroyed as heavy rains turned farms, including the strawberry fields at Barangay Betag here, into a huge lagoon.
The weather bureau recorded 760 millimeters of rainfall in nearby Baguio on Saturday, more than the summer capital’s monthly average of 550 mm.
Many farmers were not as fortunate as Acop. A strawberry gardener, Mary Orlando, was unable to harvest her lettuce and what remained of it were destroyed by flood.
Crop losses
Orlando is among the 115 farmers who lost P1.27 million worth of crops due to the typhoon, according to the provincial agriculture office.
The two farmers and the rest of gardeners in Benguet have started repairing their farms to save or replant vegetables in the aftermath of Ompong.
“We could no longer salvage lettuce, like other leafy crops, but some strawberry saplings can be replanted,” Orlando said.
September marks the start of planting season for most strawberry farmers, so the floods have damaged young berry runners, according to La Trinidad Mayor Romeo Salda.
Strawberry production normally takes place from December to April. At the onset of the rainy season, most farmers shift to alternative crops, such as lettuce and beans, Salda said.
La Trinidad has 64 hectares of farms planted to strawberries, most of which are in the villages of Pico, Betag and Puguis.
But farmers growing chayote, potato and cabbage suffered the most. Swept by strong winds, these crops were the first to crumble when rains flooded gardens, said Lolita Bentres, provincial agriculturist.

Price increase
Ompong destroyed P172-million worth of high-value crops and P2 million worth of heirloom rice. Losses in eroded farms reached P2 million while damaged or shattered greenhouses and irrigation equipment cost P5 million.
Vegetable prices increased on Tuesday compared with those before Ompong struck on Friday. Cabbage was sold from P95 to P105 a kilogram, chayote from P55 to P70 a kilo, and carrots from P110 to P250 a kilo.
Bentres said the increase was caused by the delay in delivering supplies meant for markets in Metro Manila due to damaged roads.
In Buguias town, trucks and other vehicles were blocked by a 150-meter erosion at Kilometer 73 of Halsema Highway (Baguio-Bontoc Road) at Sitio Sinipsip in Barangay Amgaleyguey.
Farmers from Buguias and parts of Mountain Province had to take the much longer route through Kabayan town to reach the La Trinidad trading post.
Other farmers had been driving through Cervantes Road (Ilocos Sur province) to reach La Union province via Bessang Pass.
Bentres said vegetable prices would stabilize once the roads were opened to traffic.
“Not all farms are damaged. We have ample supply for the market, just delays in transport,” she said.
The immediate plan is to put up temporary bridges along eroded portions of Halsema Highway since rebuilding may take some time, Department of Public Works and Highways officials said.
Calamity
Benguet had been placed under a state of calamity on Sept. 3 after the province posted P194.356 million worth of losses in infrastructure and agriculture following weeks of strong rains starting in July.
Bentres said her office was offering seedlings for farmers, although the provincial government had asked the Commission on Audit to allow it to convert the seedling to cash.
“Many farmers prefer cash because they are given the option which seedling to buy to restart planting. Others have seedlings already stored but need cash to cover losses,” she said.

AP
HANOI – Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in Vietnam early Monday, meteorologists said, days after it left thousands feared dead and widespread devastation in the Philippines.
The US Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) said in an update at 2100 GMT the storm “is currently making landfall” approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) east south-east of the capital Hanoi.
The storm, which had weakened significantly since scything through the Philippines over the weekend, made landfall with sustained winds of 75 miles (120 kilometrer) per hour, said the JTWC, a joint US Navy and Air Force task force located in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
More than 600,000 people were evacuated on the weekend as Haiyan bore down on Vietnam.
Residents of Hanoi were braced for heavy rains and flooding, while tens of thousands of people in coastal areas were ordered to take shelter.
“We have evacuated more than 174,000 households, which is equivalent to more than 600,000 people,” said an official report by Vietnam’s flood and storm control department.
The storm changed course on Sunday, prompting further mass evacuations of about 52,000 people in northern provinces by the coast.
“People must bring enough food and necessities for three days…. Those who do not move voluntarily will be forced,” online newspaper VNExpress said, adding all boats have been ordered back to shore.
The Red Cross said Haiyan’s changed path meant that “the disaster area could be enlarged from nine provinces to as many as 15”, stretching the country’s resources.
Many of the capital’s residents were rushing to stock up on food and water before the storm hit.
“I ran to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, vegetables and meat for the family,” said office worker Nguyen Thi Uyen, 33.
“There was not much left on the shelves…. People are worried, buying food to last them for a few days.”
All schools were ordered shut in the capital Monday and extra police were dispatched to redirect traffic in flood-prone areas.
In the northern port city of Hai Phong, also facing heavy rain and flooding, residents voiced frustration with official preparations.
“The city only warned us about the typhoon very late…. They were too slow in advising people to prepare,” Nguyen Hung Nam, 70, told AFP.
Many of the estimated 200,000 people evacuated in four south-central provinces initially thought to be in the storm’s path have been allowed to go back to their homes, according to the government’s website.
Haiyan “has tracked north-northwestward at 15 knots (17 mph, 28 kph) over the past six hours,” the JTWC said on its website.
The storm was forecast to continue moving north before turning northeast and dissipating rapidly.
The weather system – one of the most intense typhoons on record when it tore into the Philippines – weakened over the South China Sea.
In Vietnam, at least five people reportedly died while preparing to escape the typhoon, the Vietnamese government website said.
By lunchtime on Sunday the typhoon had swept across Vietnam’s Con Co island, 30 kilometers off the coast of central Quang Tri province, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
“All 250 people on the island including residents and soldiers were evacuated to underground shelters where there is enough food for several days,” it said, adding the storm brought three-metre (10-foot) waves.
Central Vietnam has recently been hit by two other typhoons – Wutip and Nari, both category-one storms – which flooded roads, damaged sea dykes and tore the roofs off hundreds of thousands of houses.

MANILA, Philippines—Typhoon Santi (international name Nari) has slightly weakened after making landfall over Aurora and was over the West Philippine Sea on Saturday morning.
The typhoon was already out of Philippine landmass and was forecast to exit the Philippine area of responsibility by Sunday morning, Remy Liwanag of the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration told INQUIRER.net, adding that the weather will improve starting Sunday.
Santi made landfall before midnight on Friday in Dingalan, Aurora.
The following areas remained under storm signals, according to Pagasa:
Signal No. 3
Zambales
Pangasinan
Signal No. 2
La Union
Benguet
Tarlac
Pampanga
Bataan
Signal No. 1
Ilocos Sur
Mt. Province
Ifugao
Nueva Viscaya
Quirino
Aurora
Nueva Ecija
Bulacan
Metro Manila
Rizal
Cavite
Laguna
Batangas
Lubang Island
Santi was last observed over the West Philippine Sea or 40 kilometers west of Iba, Zambales. It packed maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 150 kph.
It was moving west at 22 kph.
Sea travel remained risky over the seaboard of Luzon and of Visayas. Heavy to intense rains were seen within the 400 kilometer-diameter of the typhoon.
Meanwhile, tropical cyclone Wipha, which would be called “Tino” once it enters PAR, was expected to enter the country by Saturday night or Sunday morning, Liwanag said.
It was heading towards Japan and would not directly affect the country, she added.

Powerful Typhoon “Ruby” (international name: Hagupit) slams into Eastern Visayas this afternoon for a four-day crossing of central Philippines, affecting the capital Metro Manila, that is likely to affect 32 million people—a third of the country’s population.
Ruby will cut slowly across the Visayas while affecting the Bicol region and southern Luzon, including Metro Manila, moving west-northwest at 13 kph toward the western seaboard.
That is so slow that Pagasa said it expected Ruby to clear the country as late as Wednesday morning.
Most of the communities in Ruby’s path are the very same parts of the Central Visayas that were flattened by Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) on Nov. 8 last year.
The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in Hawaii downgraded Ruby from a supertyphoon early Friday, reporting its wind strength at 240 kilometers per hour as it tracked toward land in the Philippines.
Still, this would make Ruby the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, with life-threatening winds, storm surges and flash floods.
All-out prep
Alexander Pama, Office of Civil Defense administrator, said the government would not cut back preparations even if the Ruby had weakened.
“We are not lowering our alert levels even if the typhoon has weakened. We will continue our instructions and disseminations in different regions until the state weather bureau does not advise us so. Preparations will continue at all levels,” Pama said.
So far, more than 100,000 families have been evacuated, mostly in Western Samar, where there are more than 50,000 evacuees, Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman said.
She said Yolanda served as a lesson to the residents there, who did not need any more convincing to flee their homes even before a typhoon hits.
“In [Eastern Visayas], the people themselves are preparing and do not think twice about leaving their houses. They know what to do,” she said.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has also prepositioned food packs in bulk in local governments, which will repack these for distribution to evacuees.
But Soliman expressed concern about the local governments’ capability to distribute the food packs to “the rightful beneficiaries.”
The previous strongest storm this year was Typhoon “Glenda” (international name: Rammasun), which killed 106 people when it cut across Manila and other parts of Luzon in July.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Ruby would make landfall in the Northern Samar-Eastern Samar area with maximum sustained winds of 195 kph and gusts of up to 230 kph.
Yolanda, which brought maximum sustained winds of more than 300 kph and generated giant storm surges, left more than 6,300 people dead and thousands injured or missing.
The strongest typhoon ever to hit land on record, Yolanda also displaced hundreds of thousands of people across the Visayas region.
Storm surges 4 to 5 meters
Pagasa warned that Ruby, with its powerful winds only slightly less than Yolanda’s, could generate storm surges 4 meters to 5 meters high, which could worsen flash floods.
The UN Global Disaster Alert System said on Thursday that almost 32 million people, a third of the Philippines’ population, were likely to be affected in some way by Ruby’s cyclone-force winds when the storm arrives this afternoon.
“This storm is not going to be quite as strong as Haiyan, but the probability is it has the potential to impact some of the same areas that were impacted last year,” said Ari Sarsalari, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel.
“By this weekend, you guys be aware, because this is definitely the type of situation that can get very ugly,” Sarsalari said.
Course clarified
Some weather agencies had suggested earlier that Ruby could take a northerly course skirting the country. But by 5 a.m. Friday, the Philippine and Japanese national weather bureaus and the JTWC—the joint weather station of the US Navy and the US Air Force in Hawaii—all said its course had clarified and agreed that it was most likely to remain on course for central Philippines.
Ruby’s slow movement is expected to cause significant problems, including rainfall totals Sarsalari called “extraordinarily high,” causing landslides, debris flows and life-threatening flash floods.
Storm signals in 36 provinces
On Friday, Pagasa raised storm signals in 36 provinces and localities mostly in the Visayas.
Forty-two coastal municipalities were also alerted for storm surge based on simulations run by Project Noah (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards).
The Samar provinces will take the brunt of the strong winds, flash floods and storm surges, Pagasa said.
The eye of the storm will remain over the Samar provinces for 24 hours, it said.
By Sunday afternoon, it said, the center of the storm will be in the vicinity of Masbate province and Ticao Island so the surrounding provinces will feel the brunt of the storm.
Potential high-risk areas
By Monday afternoon, the eye of the storm will be in the vicinity of Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro province, Pagasa said.
Since Ruby has a 600-kilometer diameter, 16 provinces were considered “potential high-risk areas,” Pagasa said.
These provinces are Bataan, Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Marinduque, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Romblon; Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Masbate, Sorsogon, Biliran, Eastern Samar, Northern Samar and Samar.
These areas, which are within the 100-km radius of the typhoon’s center, could have storm surges of up to 4 meters high, sustain heavy damage to agriculture and considerable damage to structures of light and medium materials.
The storm’s powerful winds could also uproot large trees, destroy houses made of light materials, cut power and make travel by land, air and sea dangerous, Pagasa said.
Metro Manila at risk
Fourteen other provinces are also considered potential high-risk areas, as they are within the 200-km radius of the typhoon.
These are Metro Manila, Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Batangas, Rizal, Palawan, Catanduanes, Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Cebu and Leyte.
These areas are foreseen to experience storm surges of up to 4 meters high, moderate damage to agriculture, large trees uprooted, a large number of houses made of light materials damaged, some old galvanized iron roofing destroyed, and risky travel by sea.
Pagasa listed 10 other provinces as potential risk areas that may incur some damage since they are within the 350-km radius of the typhoon.
These are Benguet, La Union, Pangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Guimaras, Bohol, Negros Oriental, Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur.
Storm signals No. 2 and 3
Friday night, Pagasa raised Storm Signal No. 3 in Northern Samar, Eastern Samar and Samar.
Signal No. 2 is raised in Albay, Sorsogon, Ticao Island and Masbate in Luzon; Biliran, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Northern Cebu including Cebu City, Bantayan Island and Camotes Island in the Visayas.
These areas can expect stormy weather and winds of up to 100 kph within 24 hours, Pagasa said.
Such winds are capable of destroying rice and corn fields, uprooting large trees, damaging houses made of light materials and blowing off old galvanized-iron roofs and billboards.
Pagasa warned against all sea travel in the region and of possible flash floods and landslides in low-lying and mountainous areas.

Signal No. 1
The weather bureau placed the following provinces under Storm Signal No. 1, saying these can expect occasional rains and occasional gusty winds of up to 60 kph in the next 36 hours: Catanduanes, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Burias Island and Romblon in Luzon; Capiz, Iloilo, Antique, Guimaras, Aklan, Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, the rest of Cebu, Siquijor and Bohol in the Visayas; and Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Island, Siargao Island, Agusan del Sur and Camiguin Island in Mindanao.
Flood warnings
Project Noah warned 42 municipalities in Samar, Leyte, Biliran, Cebu, Iloilo, Negros Occidental Masbate of storm surges of up to 4 meters high.
On its website blog.noah.dost.gov.ph and beta.noah.dost.gov.ph, Project Noah posted hazard maps that showed how far inland the floodwaters caused by storm surges will go, guiding residents where to go during evacuation.
The areas that can expect storm surges reaching over 3 meters are Talalora and Sta. Rita, Samar; Babatngon, Barugo and San Miguel, Leyte; Caibiran, Cabucgaya and Culaba, Biliran; San Remigio and Medellin, Cebu.
The areas that can expect storm surges of up to 3 meters high are Tarangnan, Catbalogan, Gandara and Sta. Margarita, Samar.
The areas where the storm surges will reach about 2 meters high are Uson and Mobo, Masbate; Sta. Fe, Bantayan and Tabuelan, Cebu; Daram, Samar; Carigara, Leyte; Esperanza and Pio V. Cruz, Masbate; Tuburan, Cebu; San Dionisio, Batad, Estancia, Iloilo; Leyte, Capoocan and Merida, Leyte; Kawayan, Maripipi and Almeria, Biliran; Dimasalang and Batuan, Palanas, Cawayan and Placer, Masbate; Carles, Iioilo; Daanbantayan and Madridejos, Cebu; and Sagay, Negros Occidental.

Two provinces in the Calabarzon area—Cavite and Laguna—were placed under a state of calamity due to widespread flooding. Calabarzon also embraces the provinces of Batangas, Rizal and Quezon.
Four people died in Laguna, including one who drowned in a creek. The two other deaths occurred in Batangas, where two sisters also drowned when they fell into a creek in Tanauan City and swept away by strong currents, police said.
Police identified the sisters as Anna May Pansipani, 9, and Anna Marie, 7.
Here is a province-by-province account of the devastation wrought by the rains and floods:
CAVITE: Bacoor City was the hardest-hit area, with nine villages submerged under 2-meter-deep floods that affected 800 families, according to Gov. Juanito Victor Remulla.
Three villages of Kawit and four villages of Rosario were swamped by waters up to eight feet deep.
The other towns affected were Naic, Ternate, Noveleta and Tanza and the cities of Cavite and Imus.
Remulla estimated at least 2,000 families had been evacuated by noon.
15 towns, cities
LAGUNA: Gov. Jeorge “ER” Ejercito said 15 out of the 18 lakeshore towns and cities in Laguna were severely affected by the floods.
The towns were San Pedro, Los Baños, Bay, Victoria, Pila, Sta. Cruz, Lumban, Siniloan, Famy, Sta. Maria and Mabitac while the cities were Binan, Sta. Rosa, Cabuyao and Calamba.
The floods affected 42,122 families and damaged 52 houses.
Martin Antonio of Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) information office said the Laguna Lake water level rose to 13 meters above sea level. The level reached 14.2 m during Typhoon “Ondoy” in 2009.
Rescue stalled
RIZAL: Some 3,300 families were brought to evacuation centers but the number continued to rise.
Vice Gov. Frisco San Juan Jr. said floods hit the towns of Rodriguez, San Mateo and Cainta.
In Kasiglahan village, rescue operations were hampered when dump trucks deployed to ferry the evacuees could not pass through the floodwaters.
BATANGAS: A total of 83 families were evacuated from the towns of Malvar, Lemery, Bauan and Tanauan City.
North of Manila, residents of Central Luzon awoke Tuesday with floodwaters rising fast, submerging town centers and residential areas and rendering major roads impassable.
PAMPANGA: For San Fernando City engineer Marni Castro, it was a case of déjà vu all over again. He said the last time he was confronted with this kind of scene was on Oct. 1, 1995, when Mt. Pinatubo’s lahar, as high as 15 meters, buried Bacolor town and spilled to San Fernando.
The villages of San Pedro Cutud and Sta. Lucia were flooded after water breached the San Fernando-Sto. Tomas-Minalin tail dike. Sandbagging operations were carried out.
“This is a disaster all over again,” said Castro.
The provincial boards and governors of Pampanga, Bataan and Zambales placed their provinces under a state of calamity.
North Luzon Expressway’s (NLEx) entry in Balintawak, Quezon City, and a section near the northbound entry of the Mindanao Avenue exit were flooded.
Pampanga Gov. Lilia Pineda asked residents near the Porac-Gumain River to move to higher ground or to designated evacuation centers.
Major dams
BULACAN: Continuous rains forced authorities to keep open the floodgates of the province’s major reservoirs, including irrigation dams, said Felicisima Mungcal, head of the Bulacan disaster relief agency.
Governor Wilhelmino Sy-Alvarado directed the operators of these dams to coordinate their releases because the discharges had aggravated flooding in the province.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the water elevation in Angat Dam had risen to 204.93 meters above sea level (masl), still below its 210 masl spilling level.
Many sections of MacArthur Highway, from the town of Calumpit to Meycauayan City, were impassable to light vehicles.
Children rescued
ZAMBALES: In Olongapo City, over 200 families were taken to six evacuation centers.
Angelito Layug, a member of the city’s disaster response team, said rescue teams had been working since Monday night when the water rose in the Mabayuan and Sta. Rita Rivers.
Paul Mina, chief of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) fire and rescue team, said they rescued 178 families in the village of Sta. Rita.
“A lot of the people we rescued were children,” he said.
The Dinumagat River overflowed, prompting 60 families to move to higher ground.
BATAAN: In Bataan, the towns of Dinalupihan, Hermosa, Orani, Samal, Abucay, Pilar, Bagac and Morong, and the capital Balanga City were submerged under up to four feet of floodwater.
The Olongapo-Gapan Road in Dinalupihan and the MacArthur Highway in Hermosa were impassable to all types of vehicles.
Spilling level 
TARLAC, NUEVA ECIJA: Nine villages in Paniqui town were flooded.
Worst hit were the villages of Salomangui, Apulid, San Isidro and Tablang.
The Camiling River overflowed, causing knee-deep floods.
Josephine Salazar, operations manager of the Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System, said Pantabangan Dam would not release water because its elevation as of Tuesday was at 208 masl, still below its spilling level of 213 masl.
PANGASINAN: Gov. Amado Espino Jr. directed local officials to conduct preemptive evacuation due to heavy rains and possible release of more water from San Roque Dam in San Manuel town.
Espino issued the order following a warning from Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo that intense rains were forecast to fall in La Union, Benguet and Pangasinan.
Provincial Administrator Rafael Baraan said aside from the continuous heavy rains, the threat for towns and cities in eastern and central Pangasinan was the possible massive release of water from San Roque Dam.
At 1 p.m. Tuesday, the dam’s water elevation was 283.03 masl, 0.33 meter lower than its level of 283.36 masl recorded on Monday.
Binga Dam’s water level was recorded at 574.21 masl, or 0.79 meter from its maximum level of 575 masl.
Nine villages in Calasiao town were flooded while four villages in Dagupan City were under two to three feet of floodwater.
Trapped miner
ISABELA: Saturnino Tenedor, Magat Dam instrumentation section chief, said the water level at the reservoir was 191.49 masl, still below its spilling level of 193 masl.
BENGUET: Strong rains prevented policemen and firemen from rescuing a miner trapped in a tunnel in Bokod town since Friday. Felipe Plimaco, 33, is alive but has been stuck for days inside the tunnel.—Reports from Maricar Cinco, Mar S.

Northern Luzon, which has barely recovered from the effects of Typhoon “Ompong” (internationally known as “Mangkhut”), may get light to moderate rains brought by Typhoon “Paeng” (internationally known as “Trami”) on Friday, Sept. 28, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).
In its bulletin issued at 11:00 p.m. on Monday, Pagsasa said it would probably raise tropical cyclone warning signals over extreme Northern Luzon by Thursday or Friday.
Meanwhile, sea travel is risky over the northern and eastern seaboards of Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Visayas.
As of 10:00 p.m. on Monday, the new typhoon has slightly slowed, moving west-northwest at 15 kph, with maximum sustained winds of 185 kph near the center and a gustiness reaching up to 225 kph.
Pagasa located its eye at 795 km east of Basco, Batanes.
As of this posting, the forecast positions of the typhoon are as follows

But the nation appeared to avoid a major disaster because the rapidly moving typhoon blew away before wreaking more damage, officials said.
Typhoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) left the Philippines early Saturday on a path toward Southeast Asia, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted. Forecasters said the storm was expected to pick up renewed strength over the South China Sea on its way toward Vietnam.
As of 11am, over 100 people are feared dead in the wake of “Yolanda’s” destruction, according to Capt. John Andrews, deputy director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.
Nearly 750,000 people were forced to flee their homes.
Weather officials said ‘Yolanda’ had sustained winds of 235 kph (147 mph) with gusts of 275 kph (170 mph) when it made landfall. By those measurements, ‘Yolanda’ would be comparable to a strong Category 4 hurricane in the U.S., nearly in the top category, a 5.
Hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are the same thing. They are just called different names in different parts of the world.
Because of cut-off communications in the Philippines, it was impossible to know the full extent of casualties and damage. At least two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree and another was struck by lightning, official reports said.
Southern Leyte Gov. Roger Mercado said the typhoon ripped roofs off houses and triggered landslides that blocked roads.
The dense clouds and heavy rains made the day seem almost as dark as night, he said.
“When you’re faced with such a scenario, you can only pray, and pray and pray,” Mercado told The Associated Press by telephone, adding that mayors in the province had not called in to report any major damage.
“I hope that means they were spared and not the other way around,” he said. “My worst fear is there will be massive loss of lives and property.”
Eduardo del Rosario, head of the disaster response agency, said the speed at which the typhoon sliced through the central islands — 40 kph (25 mph) — helped prevent its 600-kilometer (375-mile) band of rain clouds from dumping enough of their load to overflow waterways. Flooding from heavy rains is often the main cause of deaths from typhoons.
“It has helped that the typhoon blew very fast in terms of preventing lots of casualties,” regional military commander Lt. Gen. Roy Deveraturda said. He said the massive evacuation of villagers before the storm also saved many lives.
The Philippines, which is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms a year, has in recent years become more serious about preparations to reduce deaths. Public service announcements are frequent, as are warnings by the president and high-ranking officials that are regularly carried on radio and TV and social networking sites.
High waves triggered by powerful winds of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” pound the sea wall of Legazpi City on Friday. AFP
President Benigno Aquino III assured the public of war-like preparations, with three C-130 air force cargo planes and 32 military helicopters and planes on standby, along with 20 navy ships.
Among the evacuees were thousands of residents of Bohol who had been camped in tents and other makeshift shelters since a magnitude-7.2 earthquake hit the island province last month.
Relief workers said they were struggling to find ways to deliver food and other supplies, with roads blocked by landslides and fallen trees.
World weather experts were calling the typhoon one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record at the time it hit land, but not quite the windiest. There were disputes over just how strong it is because of differences in the way storms are measured.
“In terms of the world I don’t think it’s the strongest,” said Taoyang Peng, a tropical cyclone scientist at the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva. But he added that “it is one of the strongest typhoons to make landfall” and probably the strongest to hit the Philippines.
The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center put Haiyan’s sustained winds at 315 kph (196 mph) just minutes before it made landfall Thursday, which would be a world record. However, officials in Tokyo and the Philippines but the wind speed at about 235 kph (147 mph).
Peng said his group considers Tokyo the authority in this case because it’s the closest regional center to the storm.
The best way to measure a storm is with radar from a plane flying in and out of it. That’s not done in Asia, where they use satellite imagery and ground measurements instead.
Not until meteorologists can conduct a deep investigation will scientists know just how strong Haiyan actually was, but it will easily be one of the strongest on record, former U.S. National Hurricane Center director Max Mayfield told the AP on Friday.
Mayfield described looking at radar images of Haiyan, saying, “it has got to weaken, it has got to weaken” — and yet it didn’t.

AFP

MANILA, Philippines — Super Typhoon “Ompong” (international name Vongfong), this year’s most powerful storm, will spare the Philippines with its strong winds and torrential rains, the weather bureau said Wednesday.
The super typhoon packed maximum sustained winds of 215 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 250 kph, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said.
Ompong, which is currently heading towards southern Japan, will spare the Philippines with its strong winds and torrential rains even if it is within the Philippine area of responsibility. Pagasa said it will not have any direct effect to the country.
It was last observed 1,080 kilometers east of Tuguegarao City, moving west northwest at 17 kph.

“Super Typhoon Vongfong has become the strongest tropical cyclone of 2014 after intensifying rapidly overnight Monday into Tuesday, US time,” US-based The Weather Channel reported.
“It’s safe to say Vongfong is the strongest storm on earth since Haiyan last year,” said Michael Lowry, storm specialist for The Weather Channel.
At its peak, Super Typhoon “Yolanda” (Haiyan), was the strongest typhoon for 2013, packed maximum sustained winds of 235 kilometers per hour with gusts of up to 275 kph. It killed about 6,000 people when it hit Central Philippines.
Based on tracks, Ompong has the same path with Typhoon “Neneng” (international name Phanfone) which made landfall in Japan early this week.

The metropolis and the densely populated northern provinces, however, were spared from being directly battered as the typhoon’s fierce winds shifted slightly away, officials said. Videos by AP/AFP. Edited by INQUIRER.net’s Ryan Leagogo  
MANILA, Philippines–Typhoon Glenda (international name: Rammasun) sped up while maintaining its strength early Wednesday, and thus may leave the Philippine landmass sooner than expected.
“Typhoon Glenda is expected to cross Metro Manila early this morning and exit landmass via Zambales by noon today,” the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said in an advisory at 4:15 a.m.

The typhoon now moved at 26 kilometers per hour west northwest from the previous 19 kph. It packed maximum sustained winds of 150 kph near the center and gusts of up to 185 kph.
Glenda was last observed 70 kilometers southeast of Metro Manila.
By Thursday morning, Glenda is forecast to be 190 km west of Dagupan City, and by Friday morning, 580 km northwest of Dagupan City or outside the Philippine area of responsibility.
Signal No. 3 was hoisted over Pangasinan, Zambales, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan, Quezon including Polillo and Alabat Island, Rizal, Cavite, Batangas, Laguna, Marinduque, northern part of Mindoro provinces including Lubang Island and Metro Manila.
Under Signal No. 3, travel by land, sea and air is dangerous. This may also cause heavy damage to agriculture. There is also moderate to heavy disruption of electrical power and communication services.
Signal No. 2 was raised in La Union, Benguet, Nueva Ecija, Southern Aurora, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Albay, Burias Island, Romblon, rest of Oriental and Occidental Mindoro.
Signal No. 1 was declared in Ilocos Sur, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, rest of Aurora, Catanduanes, Sorsogon, Ticao Island and Masbate.
Areas under storm signals were also warned of possible flashfloods and landslides.
Storm surges of up to 3 meters is also possible in coastal areas under Signal Nos. 2 and 3.
Monitoring systems up
The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) said it had alerted all of its district and engineering offices to “respond to any eventualities” as Glenda blew into the country.
The Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) and the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) said all monitoring systems were up and personnel were ready to respond to emergencies as the typhoon crossed the capital.
Meralco spokesnan Joe Zaldarriaga urged the public to keep all channels of communication open and ready, including devices for charging cell phones, laptops, radios and other gadgets.
Customers may tune in to the different public service radio stations should power interruptions occur, Zaldarriaga said.
They may get in touch with Meralco Call Center at 16211 or visit Meralco’s website (www.meralco.com. ph), Facebook page (www.facebook.com/meralco) and Twitter account (@meralco) for updates.
Customers may also text their concerns to 0920-9716211 (Smart), 0917-5516211 (Globe) and 0925-7716211 (Sun).
The NGCP said it was monitoring transmission lines in Glenda’s path. With personnel and equipment ready, the company said restoration work would be immediate where this would be required.
Glenda slammed into Albay past 5 p.m. Tuesday as thousands of people sought shelter in evacuation centers.
As early as 24 hours before Glenda hit land, thousands of families in coastal and other low-lying areas had been evacuated to safer grounds, a preemptive measure organized by the provincial government.
Similar preemptive evacuations were also carried out in the provinces of Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Sorsogon, Masbate and Catanduanes.
While gusty winds in Catanduanes reached more than 100 kph at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, Lourdes Fadrigole, with her family of six, felt safe at the provincial capitol lobby.
They had been there since 10 a.m., arriving with around 60 other families as the local government evacuated coastal villages as a safety measure for the coming of Glenda.
Fadrigole’s husband stayed behind to watch over their seaside home in Rawis village.
She brought a mattress for  her children, including her 2-month-old baby, to lie on.
Another evacuee, Jose Toquero, said he and his wife decided to leave their house in Concepcion as they feared a storm surge.
But unlike Fadrigole and Toquero, the few who went to evacuation shelters, most people stayed in their homes.
Bicol police also said three men were listed as missing off Catanduanes on Tuesday, a day after they pushed out to sea to fish and failed to return.
Stranded passengers
From 841 on Monday afternoon, the number of ship passengers stranded in various ports in Luzon and the Visayas stood at 6,824 on Tuesday afternoon
The Philippine Coast Guard said that “as of 4 p.m., the stranded passengers were monitored in various ports in Bicol (1,433), Southern Tagalog (2,306), Eastern Visayas (1,596) and Metro Manila (1,489).
At least 73 domestic and international flights were canceled on Tuesday as Glenda threatened Luzon.
The Philippine National Police readied disaster response as the typhoon bore down on the country’s eastern seaboard.
PNP Director General Alan Purisima activated the National Headquarters’ Disaster Incident Management Task Group to coordinate all disaster response operations in areas on Glenda’s path.
Power down
Power lines were down in many parts of Albay and the Camarines provinces and were completely cut off in Catanduanes and Sorsogon, according to data gathered from the website of the Office of Civil Defense-Regional Disaster  Risk Reduction and Management Council (OCD-RDRRMC) in Bicol.
The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC), said cell-phone communication “would be cut soon.”
The OCD-RDRRMC reported that as of 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 66,859 families were evacuated all over the Bicol region: Albay, 62,951 families; Catanduanes, 110; Camarines Sur, 1,564; Sorsogon, 2,036; Masbate, 17; and Camarines Norte, 181.
There was no power in the entire province as tree branches fell and roofs, leaves, twigs and other debris were seen littering the streets.
The PDRRMC said it could take time for the electric company to clear the lines.
Relief  had been distributed to evacuation centers, but the evacuees also brought their own food and kitchen utensils.
In Albay, the provincial government had planned to evacuate 45,000 families, but that number was surpassed after Pagasa announced that Glenda would hit the province and neighboring Sorsogon between 6 and 8 p.m.
Not crowded this time
But unlike in the past, evacuation centers in elementary and high schools were not crowded.
At Albay Central School in Legazpi City where 12 rooms with a capacity of 15 families for each room were reserved for  evacuees, only 51 families from Barangays 15, 16 and 17 evacuated.
Norma Abion, 56 of Barangay 16 whose family left their house, said they were safe at the evacuation center, unlike during  Typhoon “Reming” (international name: Durian) in 2006 when floodwaters reached 3 meters.
“After eight years when we experienced intense devastation, we just have to be extra careful,” she said in an interview.
Magallanes fiesta
Glenda struck on the eve of the town fiesta in Magallanes, Sorsogon, and residents were reluctant to leave their homes despite the threat of  storm surge.
The residents, some employed in municipal government offices, proceeded to cook fiesta food unmindful of the pouring rain.
“The residents were insisting that they were safe in their homes. But for those who left their homes, evacuation started at 1 p.m.,” said Ruben Conda, action officer of the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development  (DSWD) said it had prepositioned enough relief stocks in the areas  expected to be hit by Glenda.
In a statement, the DSWD said 78,722 family food packs, 755,404 assorted food items, and 506,260 assorted nonfood items were ready at the National Resource Operations Center in Pasay City and in field offices in the Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Southern Luzon, Cordillera Administrative Region and in Metro Manila.
In the Bicol region, the DSWD field office had readied 2,244 family food packs, 189,764 assorted food items and 55, 224 assorted nonfood items to be distributed to local governments.
The DSWD added that an additional 150 sacks of rice had been reserved for Catanduanes.
In Northern Samar, the field office was preparing 2,000 family food packs.
‘Yolanda’ survivors
In Tacloban City, 290 families still living in tents after Yolanda were evacuated to safer grounds.
The DSWD said it would augment the city government’s resources with 500 food packs, 500 blankets and 2,500 pieces of bottled water.
The field office in the Visayas has 7,528 food packs and 22,500 rice packs and a standby P1-million standby fund, the DSWD said.
Gerard Paragas of the Tacloban City Disaster and Risk Reduction Management said 157 families living in tents in two villages in San Jose district were evacuated to the astrodome on Tuesday morning.
Latest figures provided by the local government put the number of evacuees at 526 families, or 2,169 people.
In Southern Leyte, at least three houses in Asuncion village, Maasin City, were damaged by big waves.
A barge ran aground in Hindang village, Leyte province, due to big waves generated by Glenda. All members of the crew were reported safe.
In Cebu province, Gov. Hilario Davide III ordered the suspension of classes at all levels on Tuesday morning and a fishing boat docked at Medellin town capsized. No one was hurt.
In Negros Occidental province, two fishermen were rescued after their boat capsized off Pontevedra town.–With reports from Dona Z. Pazzibugan, Jeanette I. Andrade, Riza T. Olchondra, Julie M.

Although the entire province suffered from the onslaught of Tisoy, provincial administrator Nelson Cortez said they prioritized the areas heavily affected by the typhoon.
“The towns of Oras, Arteche, Maslog, San Policarpo, and Jipapad sustained major damage due to the massive flooding they experienced spawned by Typhoon Tisoy,” Cortez said.
He said the flooding in these areas reached 12 feet, submerging houses mostly made of light materials.
The provincial government has earlier assisted the affected families in the form of food packs.
With the declaration of the state of calamity, these towns could now use their respective calamity funds to address the needs of the people.
The report of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council said Tisoy affected 25,074 families or 46,776 individuals in Eastern Samar, which is composed of 22 towns and the city of Borongan.
Damage to crops, property, and infrastructure was pegged at P51.16 million.
In the five towns placed under a state of calamity, massive flooding affected 15,546 families involving 35,986 persons.
Also, 3,907 houses were damaged and 44 houses were destroyed.
Damage to infrastructure in these areas reached P5.59 million, while damage to crops and fisheries was placed at P33.42 million.
On December 4, Northern Samar province also declared a state of calamity due to Tisoy, the strongest typhoon to hit Eastern Visayas this year.
Meanwhile, the Police Regional Office in Eastern Visayas (PRO-8) reported that several police stations suffered P1 million damage due to Tisoy, according to a press statement issued by Police Brigadier General Ferdinand Divina.
Divina hoped that their central office would speed up the release of funds so these police stations could be repaired immediately.
“(The) PRO-8 is expecting its higher office to fast-track the release of funds for the immediate repair of said damaged infrastructures. Although this is an unfortunate event for Eastern Visayas, rest assured that this will not in any way hamper the delivery of service to the public,” Divina said.

MANILA, Philippines—Typhoon Lawin gained more strength as it headed farther northern Luzon, the state weather bureau said Wednesday.
Public storm warning signal number 2 remained hoisted in Batanes Group of Islands and Cagayan including Calayan and Babuyan Group of Islands, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said.
Public storm warning signal number 1 was raised in Ilocos Norte, Kalinga, Apayao, Abra and Isabela.
It was last seen 435 km east of Tuguegarao, with maximum sustained winds of 215 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 250 kph.
The typhoon also moved slowly northwest towards Batanes-Cagayan at 9 kph.
Lawin was forecast to be 290 km East of Aparri, Cagayan by Thursday morning. By Friday morning, it will be at 80 km northeast of Calayan Island and at 205 km northwest of Basco, Batanes by Saturday morning.
Heavy to intense rains were seen to be brought by Lawin and will enhance the southwest monsoon that will bring occasional moderate to heavy rains in Mimaropa, Bicol region and Visayas.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Disaster authorities in Bicol are on heightened alert and getting ready with their disaster contingency plan as Typhoon Bopha is expected to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) either Sunday evening or early morning Monday.
Typhoon Bopha (international name) will be named “Pablo,” the 16th weather event to enter the country this year, according to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Service Administration (Pagasa).
Landrico Dalida, Pagasa regional director for Southern Luzon, told members of the Bicol Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC) and Albay PDRRMC in a joint emergency meeting on Saturday that Typhoon “Pablo” will have an intensity of a super typhoon similar to typhoons “Reming” that hit Bicol in 2006; “Sendong,” which hit Mindanao last year; and “Ondoy,” which inundated most of Metro Manila in 2009.
Dalida said Typhoon “Pablo” is expected to gain strength as it moves towards west of Mindanao and southern Visayas, affecting areas that include the Bicol region.
In a worst case scenario, Typhoon “Pablo” by Monday is expected to bring a maximum sustained winds and gustiness of 238 kilometers per hour (kph) with an estimated diameter of 700 kilometers, intense rainfall of 300 to 400 mm, and a speed of 22 kph.
Dalida said Typhoon “Pablo” developed its intensity in an unusual and unique manner called “corioles effect” as it developed five degrees north-south of the equator. “Corioles effect – meaning the weather event had developed in an area where it should not have evolved.”
Dalida said Typhoon “Pablo” is expected to hovers over Bicol on Wednesday affecting the provinces of Masbate, Sorsogon, Albay, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte. Strong winds and heavy rains will prevail in these areas and storm surge as high as 6 meters would occur in coastal areas in the eastern seaboard of the region, he said.
Disaster authorities in these provinces would then have to watch out for flooding, landslides and storm surges, prompting the RDRRMC to place on red alert status the whole of Bicol region effective Saturday.
Bernardo Alejandro, director of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and RDRRMC, said their operation center is now open round-the-clock until the typhoon passes, with the Departments of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and of Health (DOH) likewise readying relief and medical supplies and the military and police preparing trucks and personnel for immediate dispatch in case of evacuations.
Albay Gov. Joey Salceda activated on Saturday all disaster councils across the 15 towns and three cities of the province and reminded them of Capitol’s “zero casualty” goal during periods of disaster.
He said activities for the “Karangahan Green Christmas,” a November 25 to December 25 program that discourages use of firecrackers and plastic Christmas decorations, have been put on hold until further notice.
Salceda said they would implement on Tuesday the preventive evacuation of some 350,000 people living in flood, landslide and storm surge prone areas.
At least P54 million calamity fund, he said, is available for this emergency.
At 4:00 p.m. Sunday, the eye of Typhoon Pablo was located based on satellite and surface data at 970 km Southeast of Hinatuan City (06.4 °N, 135.6 °E) with maximum sustained winds of 185 kph and gustiness of up to 220 kph. It is forecast to move West Northwest at 22 kph.

AP PHOTO/AARON FAVILA
MANILA, Philippines–Eating dinner by candle light or kerosene lamp will be the norm for many people in the Bicol Region, Quezon province, Calabarzon and parts of Pampanga province until early next month.
The Department of Energy on Thursday said that it would take at least two more weeks to fully restore power service that Typhoon “Glenda” cut in these areas.
But residents of Metro Manila and other parts of the franchise area of Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) may get power earlier as the distributor’s network was not as badly hit as the provinces in southern Luzon.
Meralco aimed to restore 96 percent of its network by 10 p.m. Friday.
Energy Secretary Carlos Jericho Petilla said in a briefing that the main transmission lines in Luzon that were damaged by Glenda may be restored as early as July 19.
That would mean 10 to 50 percent of Quezon and the Bicol Region would be restored along with northern Luzon.
“At the latest, the major lines may be restored by July 22 and then the sublines will follow, and then the distribution lines. There are areas where the restoration down to the households will be faster; there are areas where it will be slower, for various reasons,” Petilla said.
Rotating brownouts
Meralco had to ration power on Thursday due to a lack of energy supply.
The country’s largest electricity distributor imposed three-hour rotating outages in portions of Manila, Pasay City, Makati City, Quezon City and Bulacan province—which are among the most economically active areas in the country.
The rotating brownouts were largely due to energy that could not be conveyed through typhoon-damaged transmission lines and facilities, some of which have been knocked down since Tuesday afternoon.
Power for trains, hospitals
Alfredo S. Panlilio, Meralco SVP for customer retail services and corporate communication, assured the public that despite the rotating brownouts, vital installations such as the MRT and LRT, and hospitals would be kept online.
As of 5 p.m., 34.19 percent of Meralco’s franchise area was still experiencing outages. That translates to about 1.82 million customers.
Major plants shut down
More than half of the Luzon grid’s power supply on Thursday was either unavailable due to plant shutdown or could not be conveyed due to toppled transmission lines.
“About 55 percent of Luzon grid’s total dependable capacity is currently out,” Petilla said.
Most major power plants, which either shut down to prevent storm damage or got isolated due to damaged transmission lines, are expected to get back online Friday.
The 1,000-megawatt (MW) Santa Rita and the 500-MW San Lorenzo natural gas-fired power plants, however, are affected by flooding and are expected to be back online on Saturday, Petilla said.
National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) said that on Thursday, the Luzon grid had a deficit of more than 500 MW with 4,244 MW total capacity and 4,760 MW demand.
NGCP officials said helicopter crews and ground crews were visiting affected areas and a full assessment should be completed Thursday.
Lopez-led First Gen Corp. disclosed to the Philippine Stock Exchange that its Santa Rita and San Lorenzo plants were on shutdown mode as a result of the typhoon, which severely battered Batangas City on Wednesday and caused flooding at the plant site.
First Gen said it was undertaking thorough damage assessment and restoration work.
3 major factors
Three major factors determine how quickly power supply can be restored in affected areas.
One, power generation facilities currently shut must go online.
Second, transmission assets must be restored to convey energy from power generation plants.
Third, electricity distributors like Meralco must clear debris that can affect their assets, reestablish fallen power poles and reenergize circuits.
These three are needed to ensure electricity supply to households.
Asked whether the energy industry could assure consumers they would have stable power supply at the household level by the end of the month, Petilla said, “What we can [say for sure] is this: People are working double shifts round the clock to restore power. Why?
“Two reasons. One, the business of electricity is basically dependent on consumers using electricity. Second, it is everybody’s obligation to make sure there will be electricity.”

The latest updates from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) showed that Hagupit’s northward movement would mean a lesser influence on the southwest monsoon or Habagat, which would mean less cloudy skies.
However, western parts of Luzon including Central Luzon and some areas in Metro Manila would still experience monsoon rains overnight.
“Magkakaroon na ng gradual improvement ng weather dito sa Luzon sapagkat hihina ‘yong Habagat, at sa tuluyang paglayo ng bagyong si Typhoon Hagupit ay hihina rin ‘yong impluwensiya niya sa Habagat,” senior weather specialist Chris Perez said.
(There would be a gradual improvement of weather here in Luzon because the southwest monsoon would weaken, and with the movement of Typhoon Hagupit away from the country, its influence on the Habagat would weaken too.)
“So makakaranas tayo ng bahagyang maulap hanggang sa maulap na kalangitan, generally maaliwalas na panahon sa nakakalaking bahagi ng Luzon, pero may tsansa pa rin ng pulo-pulong dagliang pag-ulan lalo na sa dakong hapon o gabi,” he added.
(So we may experience a slightly cloudy to cloudy skies, generally fair weather for huge parts of Luzon although there is still a chance of isolated short rains especially by afternoon and night.)
Temperatures in Metro Manila, Tuguegarao, and Legazpi City would be in between 25 to 33 degrees Celsius, while it may play around 21 to 23 degrees in Tagaytay City.
Meanwhile, parts of Visayas and Mindanao especially on its eastern side would see cloudy skies and rains due to the approach of the low-pressure area, last located 365 kilometers east southeast of Davao City.
Slightly colder weather may be felt in the eastern side of the said areas, with temperatures in Tacloban ranging from 26 to 30 degrees Celsius, 24 to 30 degrees in Cagayan de Oro, and 25 to 32 degrees in Davao City, Iloilo City, and Cebu City.
A gale warning is still raised over the northern and western seaboards of Luzon, from Babuyan Island’s seas to La Union and Pangasinan’s coastlines, as waves may reach as high as 4.5 meters.
This means that small seacrafts are not allowed to set sail in the said areas.
Central Luzon and Palawan’s western seas and the eastern Luzon seaboard would see a moderate to rough condition while the rest of the country would experience moderate sea conditions. [ac]

Yesterday, the temperature rose above 35 deg C in the cities, including Fukushima, Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE
TOKYO — A strong typhoon lashed south-western Kyushu on Tuesday and another two might yet hit Japan by this weekend, bringing more weather misery as the country sweats through a relentless heatwave.
The authorities have issued heat advisories for many areas.
The Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) said 57 people had died and another 18,290 were taken to hospital for heat-related causes in the week ending the past Sunday. This is triple the number of people who had suffered heat exhaustion a week ago, of whom 11 died.
The weekly toll was also the second highest since the FDMA began keeping tallies in 2008.
Slightly more than half the victims last week were senior citizens aged 65 and above and 41 per cent of cases had occurred in poorly ventilated homes with no air-conditioning.
As the country baked under the relentless heat, Typhoon Francisco – the eighth typhoon of the season and the second to make landfall in Japan this year – killed one person and injured several others in Kyushu, triggering evacuation advisories for 20,000 people.
Typhoon Lekima is expected to hit south-western Okinawa tomorrow, while Tropical Storm Krosa is predicted to bring rain to Tokyo this weekend.
Japan has been suffering from high temperatures this summer, leading to concerns about how athletes will cope with the heat during next year’s Olympics in Tokyo.
The mercury has climbed as high as 38 deg C since last week due to a lingering high-pressure system. Yesterday, the temperature rose above 35 deg C in the cities, including Fukushima, Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka.
A 28-year-old man died in Yatomi city near Nagoya on Tuesday as he was sunbathing in his backyard, media reports said.
Nine passengers were also taken to hospital for heat-related causes after a blackout not only suspended train services in Tokyo on Tuesday morning, but also knocked out the air-conditioning system.
Last week, 11-month-old Kokomi Nobata died in central Toyama City after her mother Suzu Nobata, 25, left her strapped in a child seat in the back of a car.
Mrs Nobata, who has been arrested, told police she used a proxy driving service after a night out drinking, without realizing until 9.30am that she had left her daughter in her car.
Statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police yesterday showed at least 39 people have died of heat-related causes in the capital in the first six days of this month.
As the hot weather persists, the weatherman is urging people to stay properly hydrated, to block direct sunlight using curtains and to use parasols or wear hats when outdoors. It has also called on the public to set cooler air-conditioning temperatures and ensure good air ventilation.
Tokyo 2020 organizers, who have brought forward the flag-off time for the Olympic marathon next year, may reportedly do likewise for the Paralympics in response to the blistering heat. The Olympics will be held from July 24 to Aug 9 next year, while the Paralympics will take place from Aug 25 to Sept 6.
The Mainichi, in an editorial on Monday, said 1,518 people died during last year’s brutal summer between June and September, a figure that is “comparable to that of a major disaster”.
The Mainichi said: “Heatstroke occurs when the body’s ability to adjust its temperature stops functioning properly as a result of the heat.
“Hearing of ‘record’ high temperatures is now common, and that trend probably won’t change (due to global warming). It is important for each person to adopt preventive measures as part of their lifestyle.”

MANILA, Philippines — Strong winds and rain from Typhoon Ambo (international name: Vongfong) left at least one person dead and damaged hundreds of homes and coronavirus isolation facilities along with rice and cornfields in five hard-hit eastern towns, a governor said Friday.
Gov. Ben Evardone of Eastern Samar province, where the typhoon slammed ashore, said distraught residents wept after their houses were destroyed or blown away in the towns he inspected. One villager who lost his home slashed his wrist but was treated in time, he said.
A man bled to death after he was hit by glass shards in a school building he was trying to open to take shelter in, Evardone said.
“The damage I saw was very extensive. The roof of one church was ripped off completely, its iron bars twisted badly by the typhoon,” Evardone said by telephone.
Videos and pictures of the devastation sent by Evardone showed several low-slung buildings and sports centers either destroyed or badly damaged with their roofs peeled off or deformed and their iron trusses bent. Villagers outside damaged houses yelled “help” in one video.
He said he and a group of military, police, and local authorities failed to reach two towns hit by the typhoon, Jipapad and Maslog, due to fallen trees on the road. Cellphone and two-way radio communications to the far-flung areas were down and Evardone appealed to the military to deploy a helicopter to inspect them and deliver food if troops are unable to reach the area by Saturday.
In the outlying region of Bicol, northwest of Eastern Samar, more than 145,000 people were riding out the weakening typhoon in emergency shelters on Friday after a mass evacuation that was complicated and slowed by the coronavirus.

Ambo weakened into a severe tropical storm after hitting land and was blowing northwest toward the populous main northern island of Luzon, government forecasters said.
Its maximum sustained wind speed dropped to 110 kilometers per hour with gusts of 150 kph but it remained dangerous, especially in coastal and low-lying villages, forecasters said. Ambo was expected to blow out of the country’s north on Sunday.
Office of Civil Defense Director Claudio Yucot said the evacuations took time because workers needed to wear masks and protective suits and could not transport villagers to shelters in large numbers as a safeguard against the virus.
“Our ease of movement has been limited by COVID,” Yucot said by telephone from Albay province in the Bicol region, which has had dozens of coronavirus infections, including four deaths, and remains under quarantine. “In the evacuation centers, there are more challenges.”
In an evacuation room that normally could shelter up to 40 families, only four families could be accommodated. The occupants should know each other and are required to report any infected person, Yucot said.
The coast guard said more than 600 cargo truck drivers and workers were stranded by the travel suspension. All were required to wear masks and prohibited from mingling.
The typhoon hit as the Philippines struggles to deal with coronavirus outbreaks, largely with a lockdown in Luzon that is to be eased this weekend, except in metropolitan Manila and two other high-risk areas. The rest of the country will be placed in less restrictive quarantine, and crucial businesses will partially reopen starting next week.
The Philippines has reported more than 12,000 cases, including 806 deaths, among the highest in Southeast Asia.

BEIJING — China suffered a double blow Wednesday of flooding and landslides from unusually heavy seasonal rains and a typhoon that came ashore on its southern coast.
Five people were missing in Yunnan province in the southwest after a landslide destroyed two houses, the official People’s Daily newspaper said.
In Sichuan province, 21 vehicles parked in a square in Yibin city fell into a hole after the road beneath them collapsed in the middle of the night. No one was injured, according to media reports.
Flooding has left more than 200 people dead or missing in China this year and caused $25 billion in damage, authorities said last week.
Typhoon Higos drenched Hong Kong overnight before making landfall in Zhuhai, a city in Guangdong province, in the morning with maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour, China’s National Meteorological Center said.
It weakened to a tropical storm as it moved west toward the neighboring Guangxi region. More than 65,000 people were evacuated, schools were closed and many fishing boats returned to port along the coast, according to Chinese media reports.
Power was knocked out in Meizhou city in northeastern Guangdong province on Tuesday night after trees fell onto power lines, the electric company said.
The worst of the flooding appeared to be over in Sichuan, where the emergency level was lowered Wednesday morning and the toes of a famous Buddhist statue re-emerged as waters receded, news reports said.
It was the first time in at least 70 years that water had reached the foot of the Leshan Giant Buddha, a 71-meter (233-foot) -tall statue carved into the side of a mountain in the eighth century.
Emei Mountain, a nearby tourist site, reopened to visitors after being closed for nearly three days.
The sprawling Chongqing municipality saw its worst flooding since 1981. Water covered roofs in low-lying areas of the historic town of Ciqikou, which was closed to tourists because of the rain from Tuesday evening.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping visited hard-hit Anhui province, where the 13 sluice gates of the Wagnjiaba dam had been opened, flooding farmland and forests to prevent more extensive damage downriver.

MANILA, Philippines—Typhoon Igme, even after making landfall in Taiwan, appears to be headed back to the Philippines, while Typhoon Julian steadily approaches the so-called Philippine Area of Responsibility, the state weather bureau said Friday.
“Typhoon Igme is forecast to make a counter-clockwise looping motion within the next 24-48 hours due to its interaction with Typhoon Julian,” the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  said in a bulletin.
The interaction between the two storms is called the Fujiwhara Effect, a phenomenon described by the US National Weather Service as the tendency of two nearby storms to move around a common pivot.
“It’s making a U-turn,” Pagasa forecaster Aldczar Aurelio said of Igme. But he added that it did not seem likely that Igme (international name: Tembin) and Julian (Bolaven) would merge because both are strong typhoons.
“They will only merge if one of them becomes weaker and turns into a tropical storm, a tropical depression or a low pressure area,” he told the Inquirer by phone.
The likely scenario so far, he said, was that Igme would return to the country, while Julian would move toward Japan.
A special Pagasa weather outlook for the weekend predicted that Igme will leave the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Tuesday, while Julian will exit a day earlier, on Monday.
As of Friday, public Storm Signal No. 2 (61-100 kph winds) is still up over the Batanes group of islands, while Signal No. 1 (30-60 kph winds) was raised in the Calayan and Babuyan groups of islands, Pagasa
said.
At midday Friday, Igme was located 225 kilometers north northwest of Basco, Batanes, while Julian was 1,040 kilometers to the east.
Igme slightly weakened after interacting with the rugged terrain of southern Taiwan, packing maximum sustained winds of 130 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 160 kph, Pagasa said.
An indication that the Fujiwhara effect was already starting was that Igme was moving west-southwest at a slow pace of 7 kph, Aurelio said.
On the other hand, Julian maintained its strength as it moved  northwestward at a faster pace of 13 kph, with maximum sustained winds of 150 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 185 kph, it added.
Both storms are expected to enhance the southwest monsoon that will bring rains over the northern and western sections of the country.
Over the weekend, Metro Manila will be generally cloudy with light rain showers, the weather bureau predicted.
“This weather condition will continue to prevail in the next three days (Friday-Sunday) as Typhoons Igme and Julian interact with each other before leaving the country by Tuesday and Monday, respectively,” it said.

MANILA, Philippines — Typhoon Ambo continues to maintain its strength while moving towards the northern portion of Samar, the state weather bureau said Thursday.
Typhoon Ambo is bringing violent winds and heavy to intense rains over the northern portion of Samar and the southern portion of Northern Samar, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration in its 5 p.m. weather bulletin.
Pagasa said that TyphoonAmbo was last spotted in the vicinity of  San Jose De Buan, Samar.
The typhoon also packed maximum sustained winds of 155 kilometers per hour (kph) near the center and gustiness of up to 255 kph.
Ambo was also monitored moving west at 15 kph.
The state weather bureau said that heavy to at times intense rains are expected over Samar Provinces, Masbate, and Sorsogon. Moderate to at times heavy rains over Albay, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, and the rest of Eastern Visayas on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Ambo is set to bring moderate to heavy with at times intense rains over Bicol Region, Northern Samar, Quezon, Aurora, Marinduque, and Romblon on Friday.
State meteorologists also warned that a storm surge of two to four meters may be experienced over the coastal areas of Northern Samar, Samar (west coast), Sorsogon, Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Quezon, and Aurora.
Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal (TCWS) No. 3, where winds of greater than 121 kph up to 170 kph may be expected in at least 18 hours, continues to be hoisted over the following areas:

TOKYO — Tokyo and surrounding areas braced for a powerful typhoon forecast as the worst in six decades, with streets and trains stations unusually quiet Saturday as rain poured over the city.
Store shelves were bare after people stocked up on water and food. Nearby beaches had not a surfer in sight, only towering dashing waves.
Typhoon Hagibis, closing in from the Pacific, is expected to bring up to 80 centimeters (30 inches) of rain in the Tokyo area, including Chiba to the north that had suffered power outages from a typhoon that hit last month, and some buildings remained partly repaired.
Rugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events have been canceled. Flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier this week, including urging people to stay indoors.
Some residents taped up their apartment windows in case they shattered. TV talks shows showed footage of household items like a slipper bashing through glass when hurled by winds as powerful as the approaching typhoon.
The typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and a half-million houses flooded.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet held a disaster management meeting Friday. He said 17,000 police and military troops were ready for rescue operations.
“The typhoon could cause power outages, damage to infrastructure and significantly affect people’s lives,” Abe said.
Hagibis, which means “speed” in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. It was expected to make landfall near Tokyo later Saturday and then pass out to sea eastward.
Evacuation advisories have been issued for risk areas, including Shimoda city, west of Tokyo. Dozens of evacuation centers were opening in coastal towns, and people were resting on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed.
The storm has disrupted this nation’s three-day weekend, which includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed to Sunday. The Defense Ministry cut a three-day annual navy review to a single day on Monday.
All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines grounded most domestic and international flights scheduled Saturday at the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya airports. Central Japan Railway Co. said it will cancel all bullet train service between Tokyo and Osaka except for several early Saturday trains connecting Nagoya and Osaka. Tokyo Disneyland was closed.

Gov. Faustino Dy III said the team would help medical workers treat the wounded and assist survivors in Leyte.
The group, expected to arrive in Tacloban on Tuesday, is composed of 10 doctors, 10 nurses, two firemen, four policemen and Philippine Red Cross and provincial rescue volunteers.
Dy said the team, with two ambulances, brought relief goods and 600 sacks of rice.
“This is our form of help to typhoon victims. They are in need of immediate help so we must lend a hand,” he said.
The Isabela provincial board also passed two resolutions calling for donations from Isabela residents and for the allotment of financial assistance to areas hit by the typhoon in the Visayas.
In Pampanga province, more than 1,000 employees of the Clark Development Corp. canceled their Christmas party so they can use the money allotted for the event to typhoon victims.
A CDC official said representatives of the state-owned firm on Tuesday turned over P1 million to the national office of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) as their contribution.
In Baguio City, the country’s vice mayors had committed to convince their respective town and city councils to appropriate portions of their local governments’ calamity funds to help in the relief and rehabilitation of typhoon-stricken towns and provinces in the Visayas.
Members of the Vice Mayors League of the Philippines (VMLP) are meeting in the summer capital but most officials from areas hit by the typhoon in the Visayas were absent.
Vice Mayor Joe Espinosa III of Iloilo City, whose area was also hit by Yolanda, urged local councils to pass ordinances to donate a portion of their unused calamity funds to Leyte and other provinces in the Visayas devastated by the typhoon.
Members of a Christian group in Baguio City also initiated a relief collection drive for the typhoon survivors. The Christ Commission Fellowship-Baguio (CCF-Baguio), a Christian group, began the drive, encouraging members and friends to donate food, medicines, blankets and cash.
Donors are asked to bring items to the CCF-Baguio office at the EDY Building on Kisad Road.
Businesswoman Lingling Claver also emailed her network of friends to do the same. Her family is coordinating a relief collection drive with the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP), a group of 10 Protestant Churches nationwide based in Quezon City.
Claver offered their house, called Frangeli House, at 1 St. George Hill, Bakakeng Norte in Baguio [tel. no. (074) 422 0483] as relief collection center.
The University of the Philippines Baguio started a drive to collect money, food, clothes and medicines to elp typhoon victims, especially the more than 1,000 students, faculty and staff of the UP extension campus in Palo, Leyte.
In Pangasinan province, a farmers’ group on Tuesday asked the national government to immediately distribute to Leyte and other typhoon-devastated areas in the Visayas all smuggled rice seized by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to help solve the scarcity of food there.
The Samahan ng Industriya ng Agrikultura, a coalition of 33 farmers’ and irrigators’ organizations in the country, said 800,000 metric tons of rice were seized by the BOC in 2012 alone.

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported that some 170,000 families or 788,487 individuals are still in government-designated shelters as of Friday, Dec. 12.
Most of them, or close to 600,000 evacuees or about 125,000 families, are in the Eastern Visayas region which bore the brunt of Ruby’s onslaught and that of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” only a year ago, with Eastern Samar registering the most number of evacuees at 125,432.
Families seek refuge at a school used as an evacuation center as they prepare for Typhoon Hagupit in Legazpi, Albay province. AP
The other evacuees are in Mimaropa (Mindoro-Marinduque-Romblon-Palawan), with 61,457 evacuees; Bicol with 25,856 evacuees; Calabarzon with 18,586 evacuees, and a few hundreds in Central Luzon, Western Visayas and the Caraga region.
Although reports on casualties and damage are still trickling in, the NDRRMC confirmed that at least 19 persons were killed and at least 916 others injured when Ruby lashed the country from Dec. 6 to 9.
Ruby was close to being a supertyphoon when it slammed into Eastern Visayas on Dec. 6, and progressively weakened as it hit Bicol and the Southern Tagalog regions. It regained strength when it reached the West Philippine Sea on Dec. 9.
As of Dec. 12, the NDRRMC confirmed that Ruby damaged at least P3.3 billion worth of agriculture and infrastructure in the Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas and Eastern Visayas regions.
By the latest count, at least 8,699 houses were destroyed while 39,104 more were damaged.
The NDRRMC said 12 provinces in Bicol, Central Visayas and Eastern Visayas are still experiencing power outages, although telecommunication signals were almost fully restored in the affected regions. All classes have resumed except in Borongan City, Eastern Samar, the NDRRMC added.
Meanwhile, a lawmaker from Eastern Samar made a plea for more donations from big corporations, saying that so far, only local and international NGOs have been active in the rehabilitation phase of areas hit by Ruby.
“Are big corporations suffering from donor fatigue?” Rep. Ben Evardone asked, adding that although Ruby was not as strong as Yolanda, the typhoon still caused considerable damage across the central Philippines. With a report from DJ Yap

HAGATNA, Guam– Meteorologists warned Tuesday that a storm reported to have left several casualties and severe damage in Micronesia was building into a supertyphoon as it swept across the central Pacific towards the Yap group of islands.
The island of Chuuk, part of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), received a direct hit late on Sunday from Typhoon Maysak and the Yap group was next in its path.
“A lot of houses and roofs were blown away, and trees and telephone poles on the main road were blown down,” Kane Faylim, airport manager for Chuuk state government, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Guam said residents on Yap Island could experience winds of 74 mph or higher from Typhoon Maysak early Wednesday morning. Telephone calls to the island were not connecting.
Widespread damage was reported in Chuuk, which suffered damage Monday.
The Pacific News Center in Guam said FSM public information officer Marz Akapito “is reporting that five people have died in Chuuk state due to typhoon Maysak”.
The consul-general for FSM based in Guam, Robert Ruecho, told Agence France-Presse he had heard various casualty counts of one and later five, but “cannot confirm anything right now”.
Neville Koop, a meteorologist with Fiji’s Na Draki weather service, said at its peak it would have winds of 270 kilometres per hour (168 miles per hour) with gusts up to 340kph.
“This typhoon will be very destructive,” Koop told AFP. “At its peak Typhoon Maysak will be as strong as Cyclone Pam.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Derek Williams said Tuesday afternoon that Maysak is expected to hit the Philippines on Sunday or Monday.
“Its official track has it straight toward Luzon,” he said. Williams said the storm is expected to weaken significantly when it gets to the Philippine Sea, but the storm is still expected to cause widespread damage there such as flooding.
The Philippine state weather forecaster said it was too early to say if the latest typhoon would affect the country, but it would reassess the situation when the storm entered its area of responsibility on Wednesday or Thursday.
The Philippines is still recovering from Super Typhoon Haiyan which struck in November 2013, leaving more than 7,350 people dead or missing.
It will be called “Chedeng” once it enters the Philippine area of responsibility.

Typhoon Hagupit slammed into the central Philippines’ east coast late Saturday, knocking out power and toppling trees in a region where 650,000 people have fled to safety, still haunted by the massive death and destruction wrought by a monster storm last year. AP
CEBU CITY, Philippines — Typhoon evacuees in the Visayas started returning to their homes on Monday even as thousands remained in evacuation centers needing food and other assistance.
Local government units had yet to account for the extent of damage left by typhoon “Ruby” (Hagupit) but many officials said early and better preparation resulted in minimal damage and casualties.
Government officials also excluded from the list of fatalities three persons, saying their deaths were not typhoon-related.
So far, eight persons were confirmed to have died due to Ruby in the Visayas.
These included the four-month-old girl in Calbayog City, Samar; the elderly couple in Sulat town, Eastern Samar; two in Cebu; one in Dolores town in Eastern Samar; one in Iloilo; and one in Catarman, Northern Samar.
The OCD in Western Visayas reported one fatality in the region as of Monday. The two others earlier reported – a one-year-old girl and a 35-year-old pregnant woman – were excluded because officials said their deaths were not related to the typhoon.
The local government of Dolores initially reported two people died due to Ruby. These were Valeriano Sumook and Juanito Nuguid.
Sumook reportedly died Thursday due to heart attack in fear of the coming strong typhoon. Naguid died after a tree fell on his house.
But on Monday, Sumook’s name was removed from the disaster office’s board because, disaster officials said, his death was not “typhoon-related.”
In Cebu, a 14-year-old boy was electrocuted inside their house in Malabuyoc town while a 60-year-old man died of hypothermia in Bogo City.
Church leaders said prayers and preparedness enabled communities to evade serious damage even as “Ruby” proved to be much weaker than last year’s Super Typhoon “Yolanda” (Haiyan), which packed winds reaching 300 kilometers per hour.
“This is the most massive pre-emptive evacuation I have experienced. There was better cooperation and coordination and these helped a lot,” Esperedion Pelaez, executive officer of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office of Capiz.
Capiz was among the most devastated areas in last year’s supertyphoon.
Pelaez said residents heeded calls to evacuate days before “Ruby” affected the province. At its peak, about 100,000 residents left their homes and stayed in evacuation centers all over the province.
A total of 49,780 families or 189,986 persons were evacuated in Western Visayas as of 11 a.m. Monday.
The evacuees were from 126 towns and 10 cities in the region, according to a report of the Office of Civil Defense in Western Visayas.
In Cebu, evacuees have also started returning to their homes.
Mayor Augusto Corro of Daanbantayan town told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that residents had left the evacuation centers to go back to their homes and clean up on Monday morning.
A total of 7,689 families were evacuated in the municipality as of 7 p.m. Sunday.
Corro said that food packs meant for evacuees would still be given out to residents, especially to families of fishermen who have not gone out to sea since Thursday.
He said there was “zero casualty” in his town because of the cooperation and preparedness of everybody, especially the residents.
Baltz Tribunalo, head of the Cebu Provincial Risk Reduction and Management Office, said that based on their initial reports from the province’s northern municipalities, 11 towns and one city were significantly affected by the typhoon that weakened on Monday into a tropical storm.
But he said teams including international and local non-government organizations would still assess the damage.
The damage to infrastructure that was initially reported included the municipal gym in Daanbantayan town, with the building’s roof ripped off by the strong winds.
Tribunalo lauded local government units for being well-prepared.
Aside from damage to the municipal gym, the typhoon damaged 12 private tour boats on Malapascua Island.
In Medellin town, Mayor Ricky Ramirez said residents had also returned to their houses as of 2 p.m. Monday.
In Bacolod City, Negros Occidental Gov. Alfredo Marañon Jr. called on Negrenses to thank God for sparing the province from the wrath of Typhoon “Ruby” and to heed the call of President Aquino to help those in areas affected most by the typhoon.
Provincial social welfare officer Liane Garcia said evacuees in Negros Occidental rose to 16,756 families or roughly 65,862 persons Sunday night as more people left their homes at the height of rains. But they began to go home by Monday.
The evacuees came from 21 towns and cities who stayed in 240 evacuation centers, Garcia said.
There were no reports of casualties or destroyed houses in the province as of Monday noon.
Despite minimal damage, several local government units placed their respective areas under a state of calamity to facilitate the release of funds covering relief aid to evacuees.
These included Aklan province and the towns of Cuartero, Maayon, Panay and Pilar in Capiz.
Classes were suspended in all levels in the provinces of Iloilo (except Iloilo City), Capiz and Aklan because many schools served as evacuation centers and the local governments decided to take precautionary measures to protect the students. Aklan and Capiz remained under Storm Signal No. 2 on Monday. With reports from Nestor P. Burgos Jr., Carmel Loise Matus, Carla P. Gomez and Karen Bermejo, Inquirer Visayas and Maricar Cinco, Inquirer Southern Luzon Bureau

In its 11 a.m. advisory, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Lando was tracked 295 kilometers east of Baler, Aurora and was moving slowly at 10 kilometers per hour westward.
READ: Typhoon Lando slightly gains strength, nears landfall in Aurora
Lando is expected to hit Aurora early Sunday but its rains are starting to be felt in a wide area of Luzon due to its 600 kilometer radius.
Pagasa raised public storm Signal No. 3 over Aurora, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija, Ifugao and Northern Quezon including Polillo Islands.
Cagayan including Calayan and Babuyan group of Islands, Benguet, Mt. Province, Abra, Kalinga, Apayao, Pangasinan, La Union, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Rizal, rest of Quezon, Camarines Norte and Catanduanes were placed under Signal No. 2.
Areas placed under Signal No. 1 were Batanes, Zambales, Bataan, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Albay, Camarines Sur and Metro Manila.
Even after making landfall, Lando will continue to be a typhoon but it is forecast to weaken.
Lando moves slowly as a result of its interaction with Typhoon Champi in the West Pacific, the weather bureau said. Because of this, the typhoon will have more time to dump heavy to intense rains.
The Philippine Coast Guard, meanwhile, said that as of 8 a.m. Saturday, 3,155 persons, 37 vessels, and seven motorbancas were stranded in the ports of Bicol, Northeastern Luzon and Southern Tagalog due to bad weather. CDG

SEOUL — South Korea will come under the direct influence of Typhoon Jangmi, the season’s fifth typhoon, this week, which will bring heavy rain to the country’s flood-hit southeastern region, the state weather agency said Sunday.
The tropical storm, which formed early Sunday southwest of Okinawa and started to move northeast, is expected to pass waters 350 kilometers south of Jeju Island around 10 a.m. Monday, according to the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA).
Around 3 p.m. on the same day, it is predicted to arrive in waters 30 km southwest of Busan, some 325 km southeast of Seoul, it said.
South Korean will experience rain over the coming days, while the typhoon will strike the southeastern region of South Gyeongsang Province and Jeju Island, with strong winds and heavy downpours.
The KMA advised people on the southeastern seaside to take extra precautions and be prepared for dangerous tides.
South Korea has been suffering from dayslong torrential rain amid the prolonged monsoon season that started in late June.
Over the last nine days, about 30 people have been killed and 12 have gone missing due to floods and landslides. Yonhap

(Byun Ji-chul/Yonhap via AP)
SEOUL, South Korea  — High winds have toppled trees, grounded planes and left thousands of South Korean homes without electricity as Typhoon Lingling brushed up against the Korean Peninsula.
South Korea’s safety ministry said Saturday that strong winds and rain caused power failures in some 17,000 homes in the southern resort island of Jeju and southern mainland regions.
Storms have also toppled trees and streetlamps and damaged traffic signs in Jeju, caused airports to cancel 89 flights and forced 38 people to evacuate from their flooded homes in a city near capital Seoul.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
The typhoon is expected to affect a broader part of the country as it passes off South Korea’s west coast later on Saturday before making landfall in North Korea in the evening.

In a report, the council said the estimated total cost of the damage was now P2,139,771,360 in the regions of Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Eastern Visayas and Cordillera.
Agriculture suffered an estimated P1.5 billion in damage with P1 billion of that in the Cordillera alone.
Cagayan Valley reported the biggest damage to infrastructure worth about P500 million.
The council also listed 289 damaged schools in parts of Luzon and Visayas. A total of 16,993 houses were reported as damaged in Central Luzon and Eastern Visayas.
At least 92,277 families, or 382,739 persons, had been displaced in 276 cities and towns and parts of Luzon and Visayas, the disaster office said.
Ambo was the first typhoon to hit the country this year and came as the Philippines struggled with the COVID-19 pandemic.

MANILA, Philippines – Typhoon Hanna (Lekima) has moved just outside of the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) as of 12:30 a.m. on Friday, according to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).
However, the state weather bureau noted that Hanna’s tail is still affecting local weather, as it continues to enhance the southwest monsoon or Habagat.
This will bring rains to different parts of Luzon including Metro Manila until the weekend, especially as Hannah slightly intensified, now packing maximum sustained winds of 195 kilometers per hour (kph) and gustiness of up to 240 kph.
“Si Hanna ay kumikilos pahilagang kanluran sa bilis na 15 kilometers per hour, at patuloy po na hihilahin or palalakasin or ie-enhance ni Hanna itong southwest monsoon na magpapaulan pa rin sa malaking bahagi ng Luzon,” Weather Specialist Ariel Rojas said in Pagasa’s latest bulletin on Thursday evening.
After the weather bulletin, Pagasa raised a yellow rainfall warning over Zambales, which may result in flooding in flood-prone areas. Light to moderate rains will also affect the provinces of Bataan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Quezon, Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal.
Pagasa also expects moderate to heavy monsoon rains in the Ilocos Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, provinces of Zambales, Bataan, Occidental Mindoro, and northern Palawan until Friday evening.
Light to moderate rains with intermittent heavy monsoon rains may be experienced in Metro Manila, Western Visayas, Calabarzon, and the rest of Central Luzon and Mimaropa.
Because of Hanna’s exit, all storm signals have been removed, although a Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal no. 1 has been raised in Batanes. Gale warnings are still active in most parts of the country, including both the western and eastern seaboards.
The low-pressure area spotted earlier on the western side of the country has eventually dissipated. Meanwhile, Typhoon Krosa, another weather disturbance that Pagasa is monitoring, remains outside the PAR, with its eye last spotted 1,950 kilometers east of extreme Northern Luzon.
Krosa, which remains stationary at the outskirts of the Philippine sea, has registered maximum sustained winds of 155 kph and gustiness of up to 190 kph. However, the typhoon is not seen to enter PAR and directly affect weather systems.

GABIETA
TACLOBAN CITY—Josefa Barona and her husband, Antonio, thought they were safe inside their resettlement site in Tacloban City during the onslaught of Typhoon “Ursula” (international name: Phanfone) on Christmas Eve.But their sense of security was shattered when Ursula’s strong winds blew off their roof.
“Imagine our situation—an elderly couple with their grandchild inside this house, its roof violently making cracking noises due to strong winds and heavy rain pounding them,” according to Antonio, 64, who has been staying in this relatively new house since their old home in Barangay 88 was destroyed by Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) in 2013.
But the Baronas’ house was not the only unit damaged by Ursula as several resettlement sites for Yolanda survivors in the provinces of Leyte and Capiz were not spared by the recent typhoon’s wrath.
These houses were constructed by the national government, through the National Housing Authority (NHA), and were supposed to withstand strong winds.
Some residents have complained that these resettlement houses, measuring about 40 square meters, were poorly constructed.
But Dorcas Secreto, the NHA regional management estate specialist in Eastern Visayas, dismissed these claims, saying the designs and specifications of these houses were submitted by contractors to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for approval and scrutiny.
According to Josefa, Ursula brought back their bad memories of Yolanda, which claimed the life of her son, Antonio Jr., whose body was never found.
“I was so nervous because I was afraid it would be another Yolanda,” she added.
With their roof gone, all their belongings were soaked.
Josefa said they didn’t have the money for repairs since the income of her husband, Antonio, a jeepney driver, was barely enough for the family’s basic needs.
Like the Baronas, another Yolanda survivor, Rodolfo Pido, 67, lost his house’s roof to Ursula.
“I was just alone at that time. I kept on moving from corner to corner of the house so I would not get wet because the roof was torn off. I ended up staying in the toilet, where the roof was intact,” he said.
Pido, who depended financially on his children, hoped the government would help him repair his house.It was a different story, however, with residents staying in housing units built by a private foundation.
Families living in a resettlement site constructed by the private sector, like the GMA Kapuso Village in Barangay 106, felt secure inside their houses while Tacloban was being battered by Ursula.
Vincent Reyes, 52, who was originally from Barangay 88, considered ground zero of Yolanda in Tacloban, said: “We knew that our house … would not be destroyed by Ursula. We have experienced several typhoons in the past since we transferred here almost six years ago but our houses were not damaged. We feel safe here.”
In Capiz, Doris Orsal was sad when she learned that the coastal village of Culasi in Roxas City was ravaged by Ursula.
“We still have families there and we know how they feel,” Orsal told the Inquirer at Jumaguicjic Ville, where more than 100 families in Roxas, including Orsal’s, relocated after the supertyphoon battered the city.
But these families were only able to transfer to their single-story units in Jumaguicjic Ville in September 2018 due to delays in the construction of the government housing project.
“Life here is difficult because we have no means of livelihood and it is too far from our only source of income,” she said.“What will you do with a house but you have nothing to eat?” she said, saying other residents were complaining that their roofs leaked and their toilets and sink drains were clogged.
Their houses were not spared by Ursula even if these were made of concrete with galvanized iron sheets as roof.

(AP Photo/Toru Hanai)
TOKYO — Powerful Typhoon Hagibis churned towards Japan on Saturday, heading straight towards the capital with potentially record-breaking rains and sparking evacuation orders, transport disruption and power outages even before making landfall.
Rated “large and very strong”, the storm has already forced the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches, disrupted the Suzuka Grand Prix and grounded more than 1,600 flights.
It is forecast to crash into land in central or eastern Japan early Saturday evening, packing maximum gusts of 216 kilometers per hour (134 miles per hour) Japan’s Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
Hagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated “very strong” to hit the nation’s main island of Honshu since 1991 when the category system was introduced, local media said.
It is also an unusually large storm, and expected to bring “brutal winds and violent seas” to large swathes of the country, the agency said.
The expected rainfall, in particular, has raised fears, with the JMA warning that high tides ahead of a full moon increase the risk of flooding.
It has issued warnings for strong wind, high waves, landslides and serious flooding for large areas of Honshu.
Non-compulsory evacuation orders have been issued to some 600,000 people in eastern Japan already, according to public broadcaster NHK.
Power outages 
With the center of the storm still hundreds of kilometers away in the Pacific, torrential rain was falling and tornado-like gusts of wind ripped into several homes in Chiba, east of the capital, destroying one.
Five people were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.
The JMA has forecast half a meter (nearly 20 inches) of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region.
Television footage showed gigantic waves smashing into coastal breakwaters and residents living near a river in Tokyo piling up sandbags in front of their houses.
Others have nailed wooden boards to the frames of windows.
By 9:00am local time (0000GMT) 11,600 households in Chiba had already lost power. The region was badly hit by another powerful typhoon in September.
Automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.
Rugby, F1 disrupted 
The storm has also thrown two major sporting events into disarray, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and forcing the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.
The storm could also jeopardize a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.
Scotland face elimination if the game is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat “disappointing.”
The storm is also causing transport chaos over a long weekend in Japan.
Japanese airlines have cancelled more than 1,660 domestic flights and some 260 international flights on Saturday, NHK said.
Many bullet train lines from the capital will be suspended, along with both overground and some subway lines serving the Tokyo area.
The storm will even force the first-ever all-day typhoon closure of Tokyo’s Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks, with doors shut from Saturday until at least noon on Sunday.
Japan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.
Hagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba.
More than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.  /muf

MANILA, Philippines — Typhoon “Ruby” (international name: Hagupit) maintained its strength as it continued to track the Eastern Samar-Northern Samar area midday Friday.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Ruby packed maximum sustained winds of 215 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts of up to 250 kph.
It was last located 435 kilometers east of Borongan in eastern Samar and moved west northwest at 13 kph.
Signal No. 2 (Winds of 61-100 kph is expected in at least 24 hrs) was raised in the following areas:
LUZON: Sorsogon, Ticao Island and Masbate
VISAYAS: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Samar, Biliran, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Northern Cebu including Cebu City, Bantayan Island and Camotes Island
Some of its effects include:
Residents in low lying and mountainous areas are alerted against possible flashfloods and landslides.
Signal No. 1 (Winds of 30-60 kph is expected in at least 36 hrs) was hoisted in the following areas:
LUZON: Catanduanes, Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Burias Island and Romblon

Heavy to intense rains of 7.5 – 20 mm per hour within its 700 kilometer-diameter are expected.
Ruby and the northeast monsoon will bring rough to very rough sea conditions over the seaboards of Northern Luzon, eastern seaboard of Central and Southern Luzon, seaboards of Visayas and over northern and eastern seaboards of Mindanao.
Fisherfolks and those using small sea craft are advised not to venture out over the said seaboards.
Ruby is expected to exit the Philippine area of responsibility on Wednesday morning.

This was after no cloud bands or low pressure areas (LPA) that may turn into a tropical depression or typhoon in the coming days have been monitored.
“Generally magkakaroon pa rin tayo ng maaliwalas na panahon sa malaking bahagi ng ating bansa, at dito nga sa ating satellite imagery, wala rin tayong nakikitang anumang sama ng panahon o low pressure area na maaring mabuo bilang isang bagyo,” weather specialist Raymond Ordinario said.
(We will have generally fair weather in most parts of the country, and according to our satellite imagery we are not seeing any weather disturbance or low pressure area that may turn into a typhoon.)
“Ibig sabihin nito mula Enero hanggang Pebrero nga ay wala tayong naging bagyo na binantayan sa ating area of responsibility, at inaasahan natin ‘yan na susunod pang linggo ay maliit pa ang tsansa na magkaroon tayo ng bagyo,” he added.
(This means that since January up to February, we have not recorded or monitored any typhoon inside our area of responsibility, and we expect that in the following weeks that the chances of storms forming are low.)
While the lack of rains may be a good omen for people living near low-lying and landslide-prone areas, this may not bode well for the country’s water supply, especially that the dry season is fast approaching.
According to Pagasa’s dam information, Angat Dam’s water level is at 202.31 meters, down by 0.10 meters since Wednesday morning.  This level is still 9.69 meters short of its normal high water level, which is at 212 meters.
La Mesa Dam’s level on the other hand is at 77.45 meters, down by 0.03 meters since Wednesday.  While the decrease may be minimal, it is still 2.70 meters away from its normal high level of 80.15 meters.
Angat and La Mesa are Metro Manila’s primary sources of water, in the absence of new water sources.  During the summer of 2019, water concessionaires were forced to ration and schedule water supply, and control water pressure after Angat Dam’s level went below the critical level of 160 meters.
The same scenario however is also being experienced in other dams, like the San Roque Dam in Pangasinan (21.95 meters short of normal high level), Ambuklao Dam in Benguet (3.97 meters short), Pantabangan Dam (22.39 meters short), Magat Dam in Isabela (19.90 meters short).
Despite the lack of weather disturbances, Pagasa said that rains may be possible in several areas in Luzon, including Laoag in Ilocos Norte, Tuguegarao in Cagayan, Olongapo in Zambales, Tagaytay City, Lipa City, and Metro Manila.
Temperatures are also seen to warm up a little bit, even as the northeast monsoon or Amihan still brings cold winds to the northern provinces of Luzon.  Baguio City’s temperature is seen to range from 13 to 24 degrees Celsius, with Tuguegarao and Laoag’s temparatures playing between 21 to 31 degrees Celsius.
In Metro Manila, people can expect temperatures of 23 to 31 degrees Celsius.
Pagasa also warned residents of Visayan provinces, including the cities of Iloilo, Bacolod, Cebu, and Tacloban, of possible occasional thunderstorms.  In Mindanao, mountainous areas may experience thunderstorms too due to warm and damp wind from the Pacific Ocean.
A gale warning has also been raised in the coast lines of Ilocos Norte, Batanes, Babuyan Group of Islands, eastern coast of Catanduanes, and the northern and eastern coast of Samar.  This means that fisherfolk using small boats would not be allowed to set sail for the meantime.

MANILA, Philippines — Typhoon “Huaning” (international name Soulik) maintained its strength as it headed towards Taiwan-Batanes area, the state weather bureau said Thursday afternoon.
Huaning is packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 220 kph, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said.
Signal No. 1 (45-60 kph winds) remained hoisted over Batanes Group of Islands.
Heavy to torrential rains (10-46 mm) were expected within the 900 kilometer-diameter of the typhoon.
It was last observed 690 kilometers east northeast of Itbayat, Batanes, with a speed of 20 kph as it moved west-northwestward.
Huaning was forecast to be outside the Philippine territory or at 170 km northwest of northern Taiwan by Saturday afternoon.
Fishermen specially those using small seacraft were advised not to venture out into the northern and eastern seaboards of Luzon due to big waves generated the typhoon.
Batanes Group of Islands will experience rains with gusty winds. Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula and Northern Mindanao will have cloudy skies with light to moderate rainshowers and thunderstorms, Pagasa’s afternoon bulletin said.
Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy with isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms, it added.
Moderate to strong winds blowing from the west to southwest will prevail over northern and eastern Luzon and eastern Visayas and the coastal waters along these areas will be moderate to rough, it also said.
Elsewhere, winds will be light to moderate coming from the west to southwest with slight to moderate seas.

(Photo by TED ALJIBE / AFP)
MANILA — Typhoon “Rosita” (international name: Yutu) on Tuesday slammed into the country with fierce winds that sheared off roofs and snapped trees in half, after thousands were evacuated ahead of the powerful storm’s arrival.
Cutting a path just south of last month’s Typhoon “Ompong” (international name: Mangkhut), which killed dozens, the new storm tore across the country’s most populous island and dumped heavy rains along the way.
Search crews were just beginning to assess the damage wrought by Rosita, which made landfall early Tuesday with sustained winds of 150 kilometers per hour (kph) and gustiness up to 210 kph. 
Authorities said they were verifying reports of one person missing after a boat capsized as the storm was barrelling toward the disaster-prone nation.
“We see some branches on the roads and so on, but it is the flooding that is destroying houses here,” International Federation of the Red Cross spokeswoman Caroline Haga told AFP from Nueva Vizcaya province. “People are needing to be rescued.”
Nearly 10,000 people fled their homes ahead of Rosita’s arrival as they live in low-lying areas susceptible to flooding and rivers tend to overflow their banks.
The high winds flattened flimsy homes, tore the roofs off others, and downed power poles as well as trees.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Rosita started crossing Benguet as it moves toward La Union with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph and gustiness of up to 230 kph, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said.
Philippine disaster officials said the storm was less powerful than Ompong, which struck six weeks ago and left more than 100 dead. Most of the fatalities were due to a deadly landslide in the mining area of Itogon, Benguet.
A month of heavy monsoon rains had left mountainous areas in the northern Philippines primed for landslides, which were unleashed by the Ompong’s torrential downpours.
Authorities near last month’s deadly landslide evacuated at least 1,000 people from the Itogon area as Rosita approached.
An average of 20 typhoons and storms lash the Philippines each year, killing hundreds of people and leaving millions in near-perpetual poverty. 
The Philippines’ deadliest storm on record is Super Typhoon “Yolanda” (international namen: Haiyan), which left more than 7,350 people dead or missing across the Visayas region in November 2013.  /kga

As of 5a.m. Wednesday, the weather disturbance was 2,265 kilometers east of northern Luzon, according to Pagasa weather specialist Meno Mendoza.
“Bualoi” packs a maximum wind speed of 185 kilometers per hour (kph)  and gustiness of up to 230 kph.
It will not have a direct effect on the Philippine landmass as it continues to move away from PAR, said Mendoza.
Pagasa is also monitoring a shallow low-pressure area (LPA) located at 1,320 kilometers east of northern Luzon but is expected to dissipate by Friday.
Wednesday weather forecast
Meanwhile, the northeasterly surface wind flow is currently prevailing over Luzon, according to a separate bulletin issued by the state weather bureau at 4 a.m.
The northeasterly surface wind flow will trigger partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated light rains in Ilocos Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, and Cagayan Valley.
Metro Manila and the rest of the country may experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers caused by localized thunderstorms, Pagasa said. /gsg

MANILA, Philippines — Typhoon Kammuri continues to gather strength as it is set to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) either Saturday or Sunday, the state weather bureau said.
In its 4 a.m. weather bulletin, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Kammuri was last spotted at 1,315 kilometers east of Southern Luzon.
Kammuri is packing maximum sustained winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour (kph) near the center, and gustiness of 185 kph.
The typhoon was also monitored moving west at 20 kph.
Pagasa said the typhoon is set to enter PAR either Saturday, the opening day of the 30th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, or Sunday morning.
Once the typhoon enters the country, it will be given the local name Tisoy, Pagasa said.
The northeast monsoon or amihan, meanwhile, will bring cloudy skies over Luzon.
The Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, and the provinces of Aurora and Quezon will have cloudy skies with scattered rains due to the amihan.
Partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rains is expected over Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon, the state weather bureau said.
As for Palawan, Visayas and Mindanao, Pagasa forecasted that these areas will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers due to localized thunderstorms.

NIÑO JESUS ORBETA
Rains dumped by Typhoon “Nona,” which has weakened into a tropical storm, have filled up dams in northern and central Luzon to their spilling levels, threatening to submerge more coastal villages, officials said on Thursday.
Floods have inundated communities in Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Isabela and Aurora provinces since Wednesday.
Abraham Lazo, a resident in Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija, drowned.
On Thursday, Cabanatuan Mayor Julius Cesar Vergara said the city had been placed under a state of calamity due to the floods.
As Nona (international name: Melor) steadily weakened and dissipated at sea off Zambales on Thursday, Tropical Depression “Onyok” is expected to make landfall on Friday evening on the Caraga region, the northeastern part of Mindanao, according to the weather bureau.
Onyok was spotted 515 kilometers east of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur, as of 4 p.m. Thursday with moderate to heavy rains within its 100-km diameter, according to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).
In La Paz, Tarlac province, the “kuliglig” (tractor) is reinvented as a ferry, as it transports commuters across the flooded plains. NIÑO JESUS ORBETA
Death toll, state of calamity
The death toll from Nona in two regions of southern Luzon has risen to 15, according to disaster and health authorities in Bicol and Mimaropa regions.
As of Thursday, six provinces in southern Luzon were placed under a state of calamity: Sorsogon, Masbate and Albay in Bicol; and Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro and Romblon in Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan). Electricity was still down in these areas, except Albay.
The Department of Agriculture placed damage to farms at P732.59 million as of yesterday, mostly vegetables and rice crops.
In Mimaropa, 13 deaths were reported: seven in Oriental Mindoro, one in Occidental Mindoro and three in Romblon, according to reports from the Oriental Mindoro Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) and the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Mimaropa.
In Bicol, there were six deaths, according to the Department of Health (DOH) and the Philippine National Police: two in Sorsogon, three in Masbate and one in Albay.
One fatality was reported in Albay despite the “zero casualty” claim of the PDRRMC because DOH-Bicol recorded Allan Padilla as an “indirect casualty” of the typhoon.
Padilla died around 11 a.m. of Dec. 14 in Bangkilingan, Tabaco City, after he was electrocuted and fell while dismantling a lighted signage of a beauty salon.
A DOH-Bicol report said two died in Sorsogon—Violeta Habla, 70 and her granddaughter Editha Habla, 11—when a tree fell on their house in Boton, Casiguran, on Dec. 14; and two in Masbate, both on Dec. 14—a man in Barangay Pasig, Claveria, Masbate who was hit by a scaffolding, and Rey Garamya, 40, who was hit by an uprooted tree in Jacinto Masbate.
PNP-Bicol reported a third Masbate fatality, Rizal Villanueva from Barangay Looc of Mandaon town, who also also hit by a falling tree on Dec. 15.

Nambio and a granddaughter escaped the typhoon’s wrath by hiding inside their concrete bathroom. LYN RILLON
Fishermen
The list of Masbate fatalities did not include the two fishermen from Claveria town whose bodies were found in a fishing boat that drifted into the waters off Mulanay, Quezon province on Thursday.
Four fishermen, two of them dead and two others barely conscious, were found in the fishing boat by residents near the shore of Barangay Sta. Rosa, Mulanay, around 5 a.m., said Senior Supt. Ronaldo Genaro Ylagan, Quezon police chief.
The fatalities identified as Efimaco Yanson and Ferdinand Bujaue. The survivors, Ramier Bujuae, the brother of Ferdinand, and Rodrigo Lampago Cabaqui, told police they were from Barangay Ababang Baybay, Claveria, Masbate.
Insp. Liezl Abenilla, Mulanay police chief, said the survivors told police that their fishing boat were already close to the shore of Claveria on Tuesday when it was pushed back to the sea by strong waves spawned by Nona.
“According to the survivors, the boat drifted for three days on high seas,” Abenilla said.
Evacuees
Residents of Barangay Isidro, also in Mulanay, rescued another survivor on Wednesday night, identified as Ernie Concepcion Araneta. Aside from the two dead found in the boat, the survivors reported that another dead fisherman was left behind in the vicinity of Burias Island, according to Abenilla.
At least 34,143 persons (7,972 families) were still in evacuation centers in the provinces of Romblon, Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro, said the OCD-Mimaropa report.
At a press briefing, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said 53,850 people were still staying in 248 evacuation centers.
A total 95,735 houses were damaged and 13,330 others were destroyed.
So far, the Department of Social Welfare and Development has released P43,404,386 to affected citizens in Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol and Eastern Visayas.
Plea for help
In Sorsogon, displaced families in San Vicente, Irosin, were pleading for immediate assistance after Nona destroyed their houses and properties.
Adrian Parades, 42, said he lost his house at the height of the typhoon on Dec. 14 to a storm surge that rose 10 meters. “We thought it was the end of the world for us,” he said, recalling he, his wife and two young children only managed to survive by holding tightly unto each other.
Barangay chief Jerry Espladon said 146 families in his coastal village lost their houses and all their belongings to the storm.
“We are appealing for help, most particularly food, clothing and shelter, will be very grateful and thankful for the assistance you’ll extend to us,” he said.
Angat Dam
Because of continuous rains, National Power Corp. on Thursday opened Gate 2 of Angat Dam in Bulacan by 0.5 meter, releasing 60 cubic meters per second as water rose to 212.94 meters above sea level (masl), according to Josefina Timoteo, chair of the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Angat Dam’s spilling level is 212 masl.
Bustos Dam, which receives Angat Dam’s spillover water, released water at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, ahead of the Angat Dam discharges, to cushion its impact on low-lying provinces.
A cubic meter of water is equivalent to 1,000 liters, or about five drums of water spilling out every second.
But the release of water from Angat Dam had “minimal effect” on the Pampanga River, according to Hilton Hernando, head of the Pampanga River Basin Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (PRBFFWC).
The PRBFFWC said the riverside areas of Palayan City, Bongabon, Laur, General Natividad, Cabanatuan City, Sta. Rosa and San Leonardo, all in Nueva Ecija, were already flooded.
So were riverside villages in Arayat, San Luis, San Simon and Candaba towns in Pampanga and San Miguel and San Ildefonso towns in Bulacan.
Twelve villages in Bulacan were flooded, 39 in Nueva Ecija, and six in Aurora province.
Aurora isolated
Aurora was isolated as portions of the Nueva Ecija-Aurora Road and the Dinadiawan-Madella Road were either flooded or hit by landslides.
Pantabangan Dam in Nueva Ecija, with water elevation at 208.06 masl, was still far from its 221 masl spilling level. But floods rendered roads in Cabanatuan and Palayan cities impassable to light vehicles.
Classes were suspended in 82 towns and cities in seven Central Luzon provinces due to strong rains or floods.
The Department of Public Works and Highways reported that 18 road sections were not passable to vehicles because of floods and landslides.
In Isabela, Magat Dam released 264 cubic meters per second of water to the Magat River while its reservoir level was still at 190.77 masl.
Classes, work stopped
The water releases and rains flooded 55 low-lying villages in Ilagan City, prompting Mayor Josemarie Diaz to stop classes and work in government and private offices on Thursday.
The Ambuklao and Binga dams in Benguet province also discharged water into the Agno River, said Valeriano Barro, flood operations manager of Napocor.
On Wednesday, Ambuklao Dam opened its spillway gate at 8 p.m. while Binga Dam released water at 3 p.m., spilling water at the rate of 60 cubic meters per second.
Signal No. 1 
Pagasa hoisted Storm Signal No. 1 over Surigao del Sur including Siargao Island, Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Province, Misamis Oriental, Camiguin, Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Davao Oriental, Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley, Bukidnon, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Misamis Occidental.
Onyok is moving west at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour and wind strength of 55 kph as of 4 p.m. It is expected to weaken once it hits the mountains in the eastern part of Mindanao.
In a text message, Surigao del Sur Gov. Johnny Pimentel said the provincial disaster coordinating center had been activated starting Thursday.

Cedric Daep, Albay Public Safety Emergency and Management Office (Apsemo), said those were the first evacuees from at least four towns.
Daep said he expects at least 80,000 individuals to flee areas at risk of floods, landslides and storm surge and move to safer ground. Mass evacuation is ongoing in 15 towns and three cities.
The entire Bicol peninsula was under storm Signal No. 3 as of 5 p.m.
According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), Typhoon Ambo was moving west at 15 kph with maximum winds of 155 kph and gustiness of 255 kph.
The storm was expected to make landfall between 10 p.m. of Thursday (May 14) and 4 a.m. of Friday (May 15), bringing moderate to heavy rains to the provinces of Masbate, Sorsogon, Albay, Camarines Sur and Catanduanes.

“Hindi po ito panahon para sa pang kampanya o pamumulitika. Ito po ay panahon para manilbihan sa inyo at tugunan ang inyong mga pangangailangan,” he told typhoon-stricken victims at San Josef National High School.
(This is not the time for campaigning or politics. This is the time to serve you and to cater to your needs.)
He assured the residents that the government will help them.
Roxas then introduced Robredo in his short speech.
“Tulad niyo isa rin siyang ina. Tatlo ang dalaga pero di natinag. Matibay ang loob laging iniisip ang pangakalahatan,” he said.
(Like you, she is also a mother. She has three daughters but she did not waver. She has the courage, always thinking about the common good.)

MANILA, Philippines— As Typhoon “Ruby” (international name Hagupit) maintained its strength, at 11 pm Friday the weather bureau raised the public storm warning to signal number 3 over Samar provinces.
In a recent weather update posted on Dost_Pagasa, the official Facebook page of the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, it said winds of 101 kph to 185 kph is expected in the next 18 hours in Northern Samar, Eastern Samar and Samar provinces.
The advisory said “residents in low lying and mountainous areas are alerted against flashfloods and landslides. Likewise, those living along the coast are warned on the occurrence of big waves associated with Storm Surge which may reach up to four meters.”
“Heavy damage to agricultural plantation, medium and large trees maybe uprooted,” it said.
Public storm warning signal number two (winds of 61 kph to 100 kph is expected in at least 24 hours) is raised in Luzon provinces of Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon and Masbate including Ticao Island.
In the Visayas provinces, included are Biliran, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Northern Cebu including Cebu City, Bantayan Island and Camotes Island.
In Mindanao, included is Dinagat Province.
Pagasa’s website also posted the eye of “Ruby” was located based on all available data at 310 km East of Borongan, Eastern Samar (12.1°N, 128.2°E) at of 11 p.m. Friday.

Lately, however, the Philippines has been experiencing increasing torrential rains even without typhoons. Intense rains, flooded streets, heavy traffic and stranded commuters are becoming part everyday life in Metropolitan Manila and other parts of the country.
The heavy and excessive rainfall we are experiencing is part of what climate scientists call “the new norm.” This means we are experiencing weather extremes that are more widespread and harder to predict.
As the Philippines is an archipelago, 70 per cent of its towns and cities are built on the coasts, areas highly susceptible to floods and storm surges. And as extreme weather events intensify, our communities and citizens, especially those unprepared and therefore vulnerable, are exposed to greater risks.
A 2013 World Bank report showed that 74 per cent of the Philippines’ population are vulnerable to the impact of natural hazards. The Philippines recorded 2,630 disaster-related deaths in 2012, a global record for that year.
The challenges brought by the new norm are daunting, but the solution can start with us, with simple personal practices, and everyone’s effort put together. After all, it makes a big difference when a tree is planted in every yard, or a plastic bottle is recycled instead of being dumped in a pile of other non-biodegradable trash, or when households, thinking of the welfare of others, manage their waste, or even as simple as buying only what we need.
Environmental audit
We are not lacking in laws and policies that should help us achieve sustainable and disaster-resilient communities.
The list is long and includes the Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System, Marine Pollution Control Law, the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Ecological Solid Waste Management Act, Renewable Energy Act, Environmental Awareness and Education Act, Climate Change Act, the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Nuclear Wastes Control Act and the Act Creating the People’s Support Fund.
A great number of environmental and climate change laws, however, is not a guarantee of security.  Unless these laws are strictly enforced, they are nothing more than scraps of paper.
Many of these laws were passed decades ago; others are more recent. Different times present different challenges, so the first order of the day is to ensure that our laws are responsive to present challenges.
We must also ensure the effective and legally compliant implementation of environmental and climate change laws. To establish the state of implementation of these laws, an environmental audit is necessary. Regulations arising from these laws need to be looked at and implementation details covering licensing and permitting procedures, monitoring, inspection and data collection have to be reviewed.
Above all, the state of enforcement needs to be assessed for it is by effective enforcement that we can ensure compliance in practice with environmental legislation.
Funding, the usual theme of the implementing agencies’ excuse for implementation and enforcement gaps, also needs to be reviewed so that our expectations of agency performance can be matched with the means to deliver.
This environmental audit, which I will pursue as a priority, will bring together the experiences and opinions of experts, government agencies, and the public, with a view not just to identifying the issues, but more important, to demolishing the roadblocks to implementation.
Let us take a look at the implementation of the decade-old Solid Waste Management Act.  Statistics from the National Economic and Development Authority show that only nine out of 17 local governments in Metro Manila have submitted a solid waste management plan.
Meanwhile, only 414 of 1,610 local governments nationwide have complied with the national plan as of 2012, which translates into only 25.7-percent compliance rate.
Perhaps, local governments can learn from the small town of San Francisco in Camotes Island, Cebu, which received the 2011 United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Risk Reduction for their “purok system.” Residents implemented segregation at source, strictly enforcing their “no trash segregation-no collection” policy.
A paragon of community-led waste management is the third-class municipality of Hinatuan in Surigao del Sur, whose townspeople worked together in cleaning clogged canals, their surroundings and seawater, and regulated the use of plastics. Their waste management program was so effective that they won the 2010 Zero Basura Olympics, a national advocacy campaign geared toward a zero-waste Philippines.
Strengthening defenses
In building resilience to natural hazards, we need to ensure that the national and local governments are always prepared to respond to disasters and all sectors are engaged in disaster risk reduction.
Toward that end, we must develop an efficient system of gathering and disseminating hazard and risk information that is linked to early warning systems. For weather and climate, the long overdue modernization of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration must be prioritized. Part of that effort is keeping our meteorologists in the Philippines.
We should protect our farmers and fisherfolk from the impact of typhoons and recurring weather extremes like the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, through social protection programs such as crop insurance.
We should also invest more in renewable energy and ensure proper management of our natural resources.
We need to improve the country’s water management programs, land-use policies, building and zoning plans, enhance the resilience of our schools and hospitals, promote sustainable housing, and improve urban and rural development planning.
We should promote green infrastructure by creating green campuses with forest parks and vegetable gardens, practice waste segregation, and build rainwater catchments. We can build on the gains of the Best School Forest Park, a nationwide public school project of Luntiang Pilipinas and the Department of Education.
We must strengthen livelihood for the poor and the vulnerable by promoting green jobs and skills in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, environmental information technology and other careers that contribute to environmental preservation.
We should also establish proficient and efficient health emergency management systems, especially in major urban centers like Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao, to save more lives and limbs and to deliver emergency medical services in times of disaster.
We can also look into creating community-based ecotourism codes that promote tourism and environmental conservation. The Bohol Tourism Code is a good resource for other provinces looking to have their own ecotourism programs. Bohol developed an environment-friendly ecotourism industry featuring a cultural adventure that combines the efforts of five municipalities: Maribojoc, Catigbian, Balilihan, Cortes and Antequera.
 
Geohazard maps
Meanwhile, we must use geohazard maps in urban and rural planning, including the relocation of vulnerable communities to safer places. Barangay Andap in New Bataan, Compostela Valley, is a purple area on the geohazard map, which means it is highly susceptible to flooding. The disaster triggered by Typhoon “Pablo” last December could have been prevented if the risks and vulnerabilities of the area had been known and dealt with early by the community and local officials.
In contrast, when heavy rains brought by Typhoon “Gener” caused major landslides in the populated barangay of Cunsad in Alimodian, Iloilo, in July 2012, no casualties were reported, because when the natural signs of impending disaster showed up in the area early on, the municipal government immediately asked the Mines and Geosciences Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to help assess the risks. The municipal officials heeded the advice of geologists to relocate the residents, saving the lives of everyone in the community.
Today, all 51 barangays of Alimodian have hazard-risk maps and they are aware of the dangers they face from typhoons and other natural hazards. And they know how to keep safe from harm during typhoons.
On top of all these, we need to conduct an effective and interactive education and information campaign to make people constantly aware of dangers posed by natural disasters, encourage them to participate in the reduction of disaster risks, and engage them in environmental conservation efforts.
We cannot prevent typhoons, but the many good practices and success stories we have tell us we can weather the challenges of the new norm.

MANILA, Philippines – Weather disturbance Ambo has intensified from a storm into a typhoon on Wednesday, prompting the state weather bureau to raise Signal No. 2 over the Samar provinces in the Visayas.
As of late Wednesday night, Ambo, internationally known as Yongfong, had maximum sustained winds of 130 kph with a gustiness reaching up to 160 kph, according to the latest forecast of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).
It was last seen 245 km east-northeast of Borongan City, moving west at 15 kph. It was expected to further intensify as it moved over the waters off the Bicol region.
Under Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 2 are the whole of Northern Samar; the towns of Arteche, Can-avid, Dolores, Jipadpad, Maslog, Oras, San Policarpio, and Taft in Eastern Samar; and areas of Calbayog City, Gandara, Matuguinao, Pagsanghan, San Jorge, San Jose de Buan, and Sta. Margarita in Samar.
Under Signal No. 1 are the rest of Eastern Samar, Samar, Biliran, and the Bicol Region provinces of Masbate, Sorsogon, Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, and Camarines Norte.
Ambo is expected to make its approach to land on Thursday night, possibly making landfall in Sorsogon and then crossing the whole Bicol Region between Thursday and Friday.
Ambo’s track slightly changed. Instead of directly hitting Southern Luzon and Metro Manila before exiting the Luzon landmass through the West Philippine Sea, it is now expected to go north, over Infanta in Quezon and near Aurora and Isabela’s seas.
Signal No. 1 may be raised over Quezon and Marinduque on Thursday.
It would then cross the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera before leaving the Luzon landmass through the Babuyan Channel.  Ambo may leave the Philippine area of responsibility on Monday morning, heading towards Japan.
Residents of Eastern Visayas and Bicol provinces like Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon, and Masbate should expect moderate to heavy rains, to sometimes intense rains over the next 24 hours.
People in the said areas should coordinate and monitor updates from Pagasa and their respective Disaster Risk Reduction Management Offices as low-lying areas and slopes may be susceptible to flooding and landslides.

Landslides triggered by Tropical Storm Urduja (Int’l name Kai-Tak) have killed 26 people and 23 more are missing in the eastern Philippines, authorities said on December 17. / AFP PHOTO / STR
Rescuers used bulldozers to dig through mountains of mud in the eastern Philippines to search for over 30 people missing after a powerful storm triggered landslides on the weekend, authorities said Monday.
Tropical Storm Urduja (International name Kai-Tak) continued to drag its way westward across the archipelago nation Monday after leaving at least 28 dead over the weekend from drowning and landslides, the government monitoring agency said.
Most of the dead were in the island province of Biliran, which suffered the worst of the landslides, with many homes buried.
Rescuers searching for survivors on the island were not optimistic.
“There is an assumption that the missing are already dead,” Sofronio Dacillo, a provincial disaster risk reduction and management officer told AFP.
The largely agricultural island of Biliran, with a population of over 140,000, also suffered massive damage to its roads, bridges and power system, which was knocked out on the weekend.
Electricity supply is not expected to be restored until Wednesday, said Dacillo.
“It was like two months of rain fell on one day in Biliran. And because of this, the soil really softened and that is also why so many bridges were destroyed,” said President Rodrigo Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque.
Duterte is due to visit Biliran later Monday to inspect the damage and rescue efforts, said Roque.
Urduja’s winds were not very powerful, but its slow movement across the central islands unleashed heavy rains over a long period, flooding large areas.
Many of the islands hit by Urduja also bore the brunt of Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which left more than 7,350 people dead or missing.
In a video message posted on Facebook, the island province’s governor Gerardo Espina said communities were running out of fuel and water as the storm had knocked out many vital bridges, preventing delivery of supplies.
“Of all the storms that passed Biliran … this is the one that we can call the worst,” he said.
As of Monday, Urduja — packing gusts of 90 kilometres (56 miles per hour) — had crossed the central Philippines and was over the western island of Palawan, heading west at 18 kilometres per hour, the government weather station said.
The government expects the storm to move away from the Philippines on Tuesday.

Typhoon “Rosita” (international name: Yutu) has weakened after it crossed the rugged terrain of Northern Luzon, the state weather bureau on Tuesday said.
In its 5 p.m. weather bulletin, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said only Pangasinan and La Union remain under Signal No. 3 while Abra, Ilocos Sur, Benguet, Mountain Province, Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, and Zambales have now been placed under Signal No. 2.

JAGNA, Bohol, Philippines — A cargo barge washed ashore in Barangay Nausok, Jagna town, on Saturdaynight, has not been recovered by its owners.
D/B SMV Mover was three kilometers away from the pier in Jagna about 6 p.m. when it was hit by strong waves, pushing the vessel near the shoreline where it eventually ran aground.
The vessel, SeaMine Movers Ventures based in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, left Iligan City on Oct. 16 and was supposed to arrive the next day.
All 10 crew members of the barge were rescued, according to POT3 Christian Abuyabor of Coast Guard Bohol Jagna station.
One crew member had a minor injury after he accidentally stepped on a sharp object, said Abuyabor.
Crew member Louie John Baytos, 22, from Iloilo City, said they didn’t expect strong waves since Bohol was not directly affected by typhoon Lando, which battered Central Luzon over the weekend.
“We were surprised when strong waves hit our vessel,” said Baytos.
He said that crew members were trying to fix the leaks and a gaping hole at the bottom of the vessel.  SFM

Science Secretary Mario Montejo issued a special weather outlook bulletin on Friday, ahead of an extended weekend break because of national holidays on Monday and Tuesday in observance of Eid’l Fitr (August 20) and Ninoy Aquino Day (August 21).
“We anticipate generally sunny, fair weather for the long weekend ahead, the best time to resume our usual weekend activities at home or elsewhere with our family and friends,” Montejo said.
“It is also the best time to do and hang the laundry, and wash off the mud and dirt that built up during the recent monsoon rains and Typhoon ‘Helen,’” he said.
But while enjoying the break and the good weather, Filipinos should bear in mind that some areas of Luzon are still flooded, Montejo said.
“Our hearts go to our people who could not yet go back to normal living conditions and we hope that the good weather ahead will somehow help improve their situation,” he said.
 
‘Weak southwest monsoon’
Quoting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), Montejo said the weather bureau forecast a “weak southwest monsoon will be the dominant weather system to affect the whole country in the next five days, August 18 to 22.”
“This means generally good weather conditions, except for isolated thunderstorms in the afternoon or evening,” Montejo said.
However, an active low pressure area forming east of Luzon by Sunday could still spoil things during the long weekend.
As of 2 p.m. Saturday, the active low pressure area was estimated at 360 kilometers east-northeast of Aparri, Cagayan, Pagasa said in a 5 p.m. bulletin.
Tropical depression
The Japan Meteorological Agency, however, classified the weather disturbance as a tropical depression, packing maximum wind speeds near the center of 15 meters per second, or 54 kilometers per hour, and maximum gust speeds of 23 mps, or 82.8 kph.
Pagasa said the new weather disturbance would bring scattered rain showers and thunderstorms in Northern and Central Luzon, becoming widespread over Cagayan, Isabela, Quirino and Aurora, which may trigger flash floods and landslides.
But the rest of  the country will see partly cloudy  to cloudy weather with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms, Pagasa said.
Moderate to strong winds blowing from the southwest to west will prevail over Northern Luzon, and its coastal waters will be moderate to rough, it said.
“Elsewhere, winds will be light to moderate coming from the southwest to west with slight to moderate seas,” Pagasa said.

Sokol choppers from the 505th Search and Rescue Group flew over the massive flooding caused by tropical cyclone “Lando” (international name Koppu) in the said ricefields. The Air Force team was not able to fly over Wallace in La Union due to bad weather.
Floods in several villages were caused by the rising water levels in Agno River Basin.
During its peak as a typhoon, Lando slammed into Aurora early Sunday and then dumped heavy rains in Nueva Ecija later in the day.

AP
MANILA, Philippines — At least 60 people are confirmed dead due to the relentless rains and floods that pounded Metro Manila and surrounding regions while thousands more survivors are crammed into evacuation centres on Friday as waist-high water covered vast farming regions.
The National Capital Region (NCR) accounted for majority of the fatalities with 26 while Region III or Central Luzon has 19, according to the latest report of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) Friday.
Region IV-A or Calabarzon has 12 fatalities, Region I or the Ilocos region has two, and Region IV-B or Mimaropa has one, it said.
A total of 39 victims died due to drowning, 11 died due to landslides, four due to electrocution, two suffered a heart attack, and four from unknown causes, it said.
The government’s disaster co-ordination council said that 60 people had been confirmed killed in this week’s floods, triple the number on Thursday.
The extra deaths occurred mainly in the provinces during the initial deluges from Monday to Wednesday, but government officials in the outlying areas could not immediately report the casualties to Manila headquarters, the council said.
“A lot of them have just reported now because their first priority was response (to the floods),” Anna Orallo, the council’s deputy administrator, told AFP.
The number of people now confirmed killed across the country since the rains first began in late July is 113, according to the council’s data.
The number of affected families has reached 2,442,135 people throughout 1,849 villages.
As much as 3,135 houses have been damaged by the floods and rains, it said.
The flooding that submerged 80 percent of Manila early in the week had largely subsided, allowing people to return to their homes, but vital rice-growing areas to the north remained submerged as more rain fell there.
Relief supplies distributed by the Department of Social Welfare and Development to disaster struck areas amounted to P38,328,830, it said.
“We need something to eat. I haven’t gone to work or been paid for a week,” said Rogelio Soco, a construction worker and father-of-three in the small farming town of Apalit, about 60 kilometres (40 miles) from Manila.
Soco, 60, said the floods, which began on Monday, were the worst the area had seen since a huge typhoon struck in the early 1970s, and other locals also said they had not experienced anything like it for decades.
Around Apalit, formerly green rice paddies had been turned into an enormous inland ocean of brown water.
Some people stood waist-deep in water and fished in the rice fields as rain continued to fall, while others hitched rides from town to town on government-provided flat-bed trucks.
Nearly two weeks of monsoon rains across the Philippines’ main island of Luzon peaked with a 48-hour deluge earlier this week that battered Manila and surrounding regions.
One person, identified as Regle Santos, 22, was added to the list of injured persons, bringing the total to five injured.
Seven people remain missing. Among those missing is Jason Pendido, 16, from Manaoag, who is said to have been swept away by strong currents of Sinukalan River of Pangasinan.
Also missing were Alvin Galang of Dinalupihan, Danilo Masangkay of Orion, Rolando Capistrano and Anthony Ramos of Olongapo, Lando Montiano and Val Valenzuela, both from fishermen from Oriental Mindoro.
Meanwhile the government said it was struggling to cope with the scale of a relief effort across Luzon that was expected to last for weeks.
Tens of thousands of people were continuing to stream into evacuation centres that were already overcrowded and unable to provide enough immediate relief goods.
“The water is still high and the local government units are getting overwhelmed,” Social Welfare Secretary Corazon Soliman told Agence France-Presse, referring to the farming provinces north of Manila where she was touring on Friday.
“We have evacuation centres that are congested. That is the whole problem.”
Just over 362,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres on Friday, nearly 50,000 more than on Thursday, according to the disaster council.
The number of people officially affected by the floods also rose to 2.44 million, from 2.1 million on Thursday.
In Manila, clean-up operations were under way in riverside communities that endured waters up to two metres (six and a half feet) high on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Francesca Deimoy, 54, a resident of Marikina that was one of the worst-hit districts, said the community was worried about further flooding, with the monsoon season only just beginning.
“I sometimes feel like I could cry because you don’t know what to do. You think the worst is over and then the flood comes back,” she said.
The Southeast Asian archipelago endures about 20 major storms or typhoons each rainy season, many of which are deadly.
But this week’s rains were the worst to hit Manila since Tropical Storm Ketsana killed 464 people in 2009.
Environment Secretary Ramon Paje warned that the Philippines must prepare for more intense rains caused by climate change, describing the latest deluge as the “new normal”.

A lot has changed since Melvin Castro, a resident of Barangay 88 in Tacloban City, experienced the worst day of his life.
On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Yolanda, the most powerful storm ever recorded to hit the country, left the provinces of Leyte and Samar in unspeakable devastation. Castro lost 18 family members including his mother, two brothers, a sister and his grandmother when surging waters from the nearby sea wiped out their two-story family house and the rest of Barangay 88. More than 6,000 people died and some 14 million people were effectively displaced by the storm.
Castro was in a state of shock during the first week of the disaster; almost unable to speak of the catastrophe his family went through. In between thinking of where to find food and water during those trying first days, he would burst into tears when reminded of the terrible loss. The pain of losing loved ones and the uncertainty the future posed for him bore a certain kind of anxiety that was hard to describe. Still, Castro was optimistic. He believed that he was alive for a reason.
In what proved to be the most difficult year of his life, Castro managed to rise up from the adversities. After a two-month stint as a construction worker in Manila, he decided to return to Tacloban upon learning that his brother awarded a permanent housing unit from a housing program sponsored by the GMA Kapuso Foundation, National Housing Authority and the Tacloban City Government. After logging in the required 500 hours of labor, the house was finally awarded to their family. Eight months since the devastation, Melvin Castro is beginning to pick up the pieces of his life."

REYES
MANILA, Philippines — Batangas, Cavite and Laguna may experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated light rains on Saturday due to the Taal Volcano’s activity, the weather bureau said.
Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon will bring cloudy skies with scattered rains over the Codillera Region, Cagayan Valley, Aurora and Quezon, weather specialist Raymond Ordinario said in a 5 p.m. weather update on Friday.
Partly cloudy to cloudy skies with light rains will likewise prevail over Bicol region and a large portion of Luzon.
Ordinario added that Palawan, Visayas, and Mindanao may experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rains due to localized thunderstorms.
Generally, fair weather is expected over the weekend as no weather disturbance is expected to enter or form within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, he added.
If the Taal Volcano erupts with a column of seven kilometers or below, its ash plumes will drift to municipalities south and southwest of the volcano, Pagasa said.
However, if a major eruption occurs and the column exceeds seven kilometers, the ash plumes will also be drifted over the southern and southeastern portions of Batangas and some municipalities of Quezon, Mindoro, and Marinduque, Pagasa added.
Since Friday morning, five “discrete weak explosions” were recorded in Taal Volcano, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.
The activity in Taal Volcano has been generally characterized by weak emission of steam-laden plumes reaching 800 meters high from the main crater that drifted to southwest, the agency added.

MANILA, Philippines — Cloudy skies with isolated rainshowers are expected over the provinces of Batangas, Cavite, and Laguna due to Taal Volcano’s eruption, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) reported Monday.
In its 4 a.m. weather bulletin, the state weather bureau said if the volcanic activity continues, cloudy skies with light isolated rainshowers will persist in Taal area and nearby areas.
Meanwhile, the tailend of a cold front will bring cloudy skies with scattered rainshowers in Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, and the province of Aurora.
Ilocos Region, Pagasa said, will have fair weather with light rainshowers due to northeast monsoon.
The rest of Luzon—including Metro Manila—will have generally fair weather with isolated rainshowers due to localized thunderstorms, Pagasa said.
The trough of the low pressure area (LPA), meanwhile, will bring cloudy skies with scattered rainshowers in Eastern Visayas and Caraga region.
Pagasa said the LPA was spotted 735 kilometers east southeast of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur but is not expected to develop into a storm.

Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas said in a news briefing on Thursday, January 30, that under the scheme, the provincial government will buy ash collected by residents involved in the cleanup in their areas.
The ash would be used for hollow blocks to be produced by cooperatives, and the end product would be sold with the help of the provincial government.
“Ash will be accumulated by residents and they will be paid for the ash. We are now organizing cooperatives where we can put hollow block making machines. We can also use the ash as fertilizers,” the governor said.
Mandanas said the provincial government will offer the finished product to construction companies.
Joe Alilio, deputy head of the Batangas Provincial Cooperative, Livelihood and Entrepreneurial Development Office (PCLEDO) said that they would tap cooperatives in the affected municipalities to lead the project.  
“We are still determining the price per kilo or per ton. We will study the costing so that the coops and residents can earn. We are already mobilizing, and we will also coordinate with other stakeholders to ensure that there is a market for whatever is produced,” Alilio said.
The provincial government also announced that it would give cash assistance to families whose homes were either partially or totally damaged due.  The estimated funds needed for this is  P360 million, for damaged homes or  30% of houses in the affected areas. (WATCH: Broken hearts as Agoncillo residents return to ruined homes)
As of today, the Taal Volcano remained on Alert Level 3 with 137 volcanic earthquakes monitored in the last 24 hours according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.
Despite giving them an option to return, Mandanas reiterated his call for residents not to stay within the 14-kilometer danger zone. (IN PHOTOS: Despite remaining threat, Taal evacuees simply happy to be home)
“Taal Volcano is still on Alert Level 3 which means there is a possibility that the volcano is going to erupt. There is a high level of risk to life and property. Many of the houses are unstable due to ash and cracks so it is still dangerous to enter the place,” he said. (READ: Not yet over: Phivolcs says magma around 5 kilometers below Taal crater)
The governor assured residents that the provincial government will continue to provide for those who would stay in evacuation centers outside the danger zone even if it would take 6 months to two years. (READ: Batangas mayors say time to change how they respond to disasters)
As of 5 am on Thursday, 263 evacuation centers hosted 9,779 families or 34,314 individuals.
Mandanas said the provincial government is also setting up evacuation centers and instant help centers in affected barangays within the 14-km danger zone, not including those that are inside the 7-km permanent danger zone.  These centers will be provided food, water, and personal necessities once Phivolcs lowers the alert level to 2. – Rappler.com"

MANILA, Philippines – After the recent eruption of the Taal Volcano in Batangas which affected thousands of Filipinos in Southern Luzon, the SM Group of Companies immediately mobilized Oplan Tulong Express, a relief operations program that gave assistance to the victims. 
“SM has always been a partner of the community, especially in times of need and disasters. After the devastating calamity, we immediately reached out to those displaced by the eruption,” said Steven Tan, chief operating officer of SM Supermalls. 
Spearheaded by the SM Foundation, the corporate social responsibility arm of the SM Group of Companies including SM Prime Holdings, Oplan Tulong Express served as one of the first responders and gave assistance to communities in forms of Kalinga relief packs, medical missions and medicines, and other basic needs. 
They also prepared and delivered over 6,500 Kalinga relief packs to the evacuation centers and sorting sites. These packs contained bottled mineral water, rice, ready-to-eat meals, and instant noodles. Oplan Tulong Express Booths were also activated right away to accept in-kind and cash donations in 12 SM malls in South Luzon. 
Aside from relief operations, SM also ensured the safety and well-being of its employees. It reached out to its employees who live in the affected areas and made sure that their families are safe and given the utmost relief support and assistance. 
Moreover, SM Lemery in Batangas has been closed since Monday but its employees were absorbed by nearby SM malls in Batangas City and Lipa City. A total of 80 displaced employees were also given an emergency fund and SM Go Bags with first aid needs and Kalinga relief packs. 
To help secure the livelihood of tenants and their employees, micro, small and medium establishments located in affected malls were given the opportunity to open and do business in other South Luzon malls so that their livelihood and that of their employees is secure. 
SM Prime Holdings group, SM Cares, SM Foundation, and their partners from the Philippine National Red Cross, extend their gratitude to those who donated cash and in kind. To those who want to donate, you may drop off your donations at the designated Oplan Tulong Express booths in 12 SM malls in South Luzon, namely Bacoor, Dasmariñas, Molino, Rosario, Trece Martires, Imus, Sta. Rosa, San Pablo, Calamba, Batangas, Lipa, and Lucena. – Rappler.com

""Talagang hindi matatawaran iyong kanilang pag-asikaso sa mga evacuees. Kaya ito talaga, makikita mo iyong bayanihan. Nakakataba ng puso tingnan na kahit hindi nila constituents, iyong pagtulong talaga buhos na buhos,"" the Vice President said. 
(The attention they give to the evacuees is unparalleled. You can really see that the community is working together here. It warms my heart that even those evacuees who are not their constituents, they still shower with help.)
In her Facebook account on Monday night, January 13, the Vice President called on Metro Manila residents to help her office repack the relief goods.
“Thank you to our volunteers who heeded our call for help at such short notice. I posted our call for help at 9.43 last night. In less than an hour, our office was swamped with volunteers all wanting to do their share in helping the victims of the Taal Volcano eruption,” Robredo said on Tuesday. 
“May you all be blessed a thousandfold,” the Vice President added.

MANILA, Philippines – Sometimes those who have less, are the ones who give more.
As Taal Volcano in Batangas continued to spew ash on Monday, January 13, some Filipinos went out of their way to show the bayanihan spirit as they helped victims by giving free food and face masks. (READ: TIMELINE: Taal Volcano eruptions since 1572)

“Wala na po kaming tubig dahil reserba lang namin yun sa desk tank. Kapag nawala na po kasi ang kuryente, mawawalan na rin ng tubig. So yung natira namin sa desk tank ang pinangtulong namin,” Gloria said. 
(We don’t have any water left because that was a reserve from our tank. The power interruption affected the water supply. We used the water from our tank to help them.)
‘Where’s the government?’
Meanwhile, Twitter user Gigi Esguerra took a swipe at the Philippine government's perceived inaction to help the families affected by the eruption. 
“Though the bayanihan of our regular Filipino citizen is truly inspiring, it frustrates me to know that they’re taking the time of day to do something [that] the government should be responsible for. Hindi ba’t obligasyon ng gobyerno ang pangalagaan tayo? Nasan kayo ngayon?! (Isn’t it the government obligation to look after us? Where are they now?),” she tweeted.

Hinobaan, Negros Occidental Councilor Jason Tupas and Pastor Russell Ban of Roxas City in Capiz became friends when they met in a motorcycle riders group. It was their idea to start a donation drive early this week to help the victims of the ashfall.
Their group, onboard a pick-up truck, arrived in Batangas Thursday morning, January 16. “We packed everything in one vehicle. Our pick-up looks like a canter truck,” Tupas said in jest.
They then headed to evacuation centers, some near the danger zone, to distribute the face masks to the victims. He said the displaced families there needed water and medicines.
“We could not cover all the evacuation centers to distribute the face masks. The remaining items will be turned over to the provincial government so they can distribute to the victims,” Tupas added.
Aside from the face masks, they were also able to gather hand towels, a generator set, goods, toiletries, used clothes, and water containers for their campaign, which they called “From Negros and Panay with Love.”
Tupas said he was overwhelmed by the support of the residents of Negros Occidental and Panay. “We were able to gather 62,000 masks in just 48 hours,” he added.
Outraged by the surge in the prices of face masks in Luzon after the ash fall, “I called on my friends to convert our feelings into action. And since the Visayas was isolated from the situation, we really have to do something. I’m thankful that many have answered that call,” he said.

United States
The US Embassy Manila announced that the United States Geological Survey's Voclano Disaster Assistance Program (USGS VDAP) was providing equipment and remote technical assistance to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology to monitor the Taal Volacano eruption.
. @USAID / @USGS ’s Volcano Disaster Assistance Program is providing equipment and remote technical support to the Government of the Philippines. #TaalEruption2020 #TaalVolcano https://t.co/XlLfLXrNDX — U.S. Embassy in the Philippines (@USEmbassyPH) January 15, 2020
According to Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, the USGS VDAP's assistance included providing ""remote imagery and geodetic sensing data to assess the current activity and additional information on potential future eruptive activity.""
Remote sensing staff, he added, also tasked all its available satellite sources to monitor Taal Volcano ""as the highest priority."" Apart from this, the USGS provided Phivolcs with an infrared camera and infrared monitoring equipment to help assess volcanic activity.
""A friend in need is a friend indeed,"" Dulay tweeted on Wednesday night, January 15.
VDAP earlier aided the Philippines during the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Together with Phivolcs, it installed ""monitoring networks and estimated the potential for a cataclysmic eruption."" The efforts led to the evacuations of nearby towns and villages, which saved ""more than 5,000 lives and $250 million in property,"" VDAP said.
The US also donated $100,000 or P5.1 million in government support to individuals affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. On Wednesday, January 22, US Ambassador to the Philippine Sung Kim joined the Philippines Disaster Resilience Foundation in distributing supplies to evacuees in Calatagan town.

The US embassy said the support, which was coursed through the U.S. Agency for International Development partner World Vision, would provide for relief supplies – like soap, sleeping mats, and blankets – to nearly 7,600 people in the Nasugbu West Central School evacuation center in Batangas.
""I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of these families who faced such devastation and loss following the volcanic eruption. As friends, partners, and allies to the Philippines, we will continue to support our Philippine government counterparts as they work to address the needs of those communities most affected by the eruption,"" Kim said.
South Korea
On Thursday, January 16, South Korea pledged to offer through the Philippine Red Cross $200,000 (P10,175,100) in humanitarian aid to victims of the Taal Volcano eruption.

China
The Chinese Embassy in Manila on Friday, January 17, donated face masks to affected residents in Batangas.

So far, Batangas and Cavite were among the areas most affected by Taal's eruption, with the entire provinces placed under a state of calamity. Thousands of evacuees expressed concern about what would happen to them, their homes, and their livelihood.
On Wednesday, January 22, the Chinese embassy announced that Huang turned over to Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Enrique Manalo over one million RMB or some P7.5 million for relief and rehabilitation of affected areas.

On 22 Jan. 2020, Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian met with Undersecretary Enrique Manalo of DFA of the Philippines and turned over one million RMB (about 7.5 million pesos) for the relief and rehabilitation of the areas affected by Taal volcano’s eruption on behalf of the Embassy. pic.twitter.com/zTGX0OXe3w — ChineseEmbassyManila (@Chinaembmanila) January 23, 2020
 
On Sunday, February 2, the Department of Finance (DOF) said the Chinese government also pledged to donate RMB 1 million  (P7.2 million) to assist ongoing disaster relief efforts for residents affected by the eruption of Taal Volcano.
The DOF said China, through its embassy in Manila, was ""looking forward to handing over the...donation as soon as possible.”      
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III thanked the Chinese embassy for its donation.    
""We thank the People’s Republic of China for its donation, which is just one of the many it has provided to the Philippines to help victims of calamities. This concrete expression of sympathy and support to our countrymen further strengthens our bilateral ties and reflects the warm relations between our two countries,"" Dominguez said in a statement. 
Japan
On Thursday, January 23, the Japan Information and Culture Center (JICC) said the Japanese government, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), donated anti-dust respirators to residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption.
""As a volcanic country like the Philippines, Japan has repeatedly experienced hardship caused by volcanic activities in its history. We are in solidarity with the people of the Philippines in facing this challenge,"" JICC said in a statement.
JICA also announced it was working with the Philippines' Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and attached agencies of the Department of Science and Technology to aid in ""improving the planning, implementation, and monitoring systems"" of regional and local disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) plans.
This is in line with its ongoing cooperation established with the OCD in 2019, where JICA and local government units developed guidelines for regional and local hazard risk information, crafted plans based on disaster risk information ""to reduce human and economic losses,” trained disaster management personnel, and improved information management systems for disaster response.
According to JICA, the second phase of the project will take place in Calabarzon and Central Luzon – areas that were among the worst hit by the ongoing eruption of Taal Volcano and Typhoon Ursula, respectively.
“Like Japan, the Philippines is also vulnerable to disasters. This is also why part of our development assistance to the Philippines covers sharing Japan’s expertise and experiences in disaster management.... Our experiences teach us that there’s still room to improve the DRRM system of our countries,” JICA Philippines Senior Representative Ayumu Ohshima said. 
On Wednesday, January 29, Japanese Chargé d’Affaires Yamamoto Yasushi signed a deed of donation with Social Welfare Secretary Rolando Bautista for in-kind relief assistance that included the following:
""As a volcanic country like the Philippines, Japan has repeatedly experienced hardships caused by volcanic activities in its history. Japan is in solidarity with the people of the Philippines in facing the challenges posed by the Taal eruption,"" the Japanese embassy said in a statement on Wednesday.
The donation will be coursed through JICA.
European Union
The European Union (EU) announced on Friday, January 31, it would provide €750,000 in humanitarian assistance to individuals most affected by Taal Volcano's eruption.
The funding will be coursed through the Spanish Red Cross and will provide emergency shelter; essential household items like mats and blankets, hygiene kits, and access to clean water. Apart from this, psychosocial support and child protection activities will also be provided.
""The EU stands ready to support the people of the Philippines and ensure affected people get protection and have enough means to survive through this difficult time and get back to their feet at the earliest possible,"" EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič said in a statement.
The funding is part of the EU's Acute Large Emergency Response Tool, which is used to respond to large natural disasters where over 100,000 people or over 50% of the population is affected. The programs aims to allocate funds 24 to 48 hours after the onset of emergencies. – Rappler.com

Pilipinas Shell opened Shelter Stations to help affected residents. Shelter Stations are converted fuel stations that are open 24/7 to provide emergency drinking water, first aid kits, and free mobile charging services. Vehicles affected by the ashfall can also get assistance in these stations. There are 14 sites in Batangas, 6 in Cavite, 7 in Laguna, and 19 in Metro Manila.
Shelter Stations also accept relief good donations from the public.
Shell companies in the Philippines donated P4 million worth of food packs, potable drinking water, sleeping kits, hygiene kits, canned goods, sanitary napkins, diapers, and insect repellent, distributed to over 1,500 families staying at the Batangas Provincial Sports Complex.
Pilipinas Shell also donated over 3,000 liters of diesel fuel to help with disaster management and response. Over 100 volunteers from Pilipinas Shell employees, Shell Retailers, Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc., and the Malampaya Foundation volunteered to bring relief donations and set up facilities in Batangas.
Those who would like to help can get in touch through the Shell Customer Service Center at 02-8878-8888 for Metro Manila and 1-800-10000-3333 for outside the metro. For more information, read here. 
San Miguel Corporation's (SMC) ""free toll"" assistance for motorists delivering relief goods is still in effect for the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) and the Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR).
As of Wednesday, January 29, a total of 14,309 free single-exit passes have been issued at both SLEX and STAR tollways. Below is the breakdown:
The SMC has so far donated over P23 million worth of relief goods, including hot meals, drinking water, grocery items, face masks, blankets, sleeping mats, and clothing. It also organized daily soup kitchens for around 6,000 evacuees in different areas in Batangas.
Motorists carrying relief goods can avail of their free single exit pass at various relief inspection sites:
Pepsi Cola Philippines provided 100 bundles of carton, 300 pieces of empty sacks, and 100 gallons of drinking water – deemed the most needed by evacuees in San Miguel Elementary School and San Roque Elementary School. Another 100 cases of purified drinking water were delivered to the capitol of Batangas City and distributed to nearby evacuation centers. 
Pepsi Cola Philippines' Southern Tagalog Region Operations Plant also provided two hydrant connections for raw water and one hose connection for drinking water, both accessible 24/7. Three lines were mobilized to help clean thick layers of ash that accumulated after the ashfall.
Pepsi Cola Philippines also committed to organize a blood donation program to support evacuees with medical conditions in times of emergencies. – Rappler.com"

MANILA, Philippines – The legislators representing the 6 districts of Batangas filed a bill that would appropriate P30 billion from the National Treasury to fund relief and rehabilitation efforts in the wake of the Taal Volcano eruption.
House Bill (HB) Number 5998, filed on Wednesday, January 22, formalized President Rodrigo Duterte’s request for Congress to pass a measure allocating the supplemental funds needed to provide aid for the victims of the volcanic eruption in Batangas. 
HB 5889 was filed by the following Batangas legislators on the same day the House held its plenary session at the Batangas City Convention Center:
The bill would appropriate P30 billion from “any available funds” in the National Treasure that have not been allocated for other line items under the P4.1-trillion budget for 2020. 
The funds would solely be dedicated to “augment aid, relief, resettlement, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and livelihood programs and projects” to be implemented by the government to help victims of the Taal Volcano eruption.  
The supplemental budget would also be valid until December 31, 2022.

House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez previously said the lower chamber was “willing” to hike to P50 billion the supplemental budget that Duterte requested.
The previous Aquino administration set aside a dedicated P26.84 billion fund to help assist victims and rehabilitate affected areas in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. 
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about P31 billion in government funds had been used for rehabilitation efforts in Central Luzon.
Taal is still under Alert Level 4, which means there could be a hazardous eruption ""within hours to days.” The volcano’s level of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission is lower for two days now, but state volcanologists said a longer trend or pattern must be observed first. 
Batangas, where the volcano is located, and its neighboring province Cavite are still under a state of calamity.
Thousands of residents from the two provinces remain in evacuation centers, while the cost of agricultural damage so far is at P3.06 billion. (READ: How to stay safe during volcanic ashfall)
Why hold session in Batangas?
On Wednesday, House committee on disaster management Lucy Torres Gomez defended lawmakers’ decision to hold session at the Batangas City Convention Center, which is located outside the danger zone but sits across the Batangas Sports Complex, the most crowded evacuation center for Taal evacuees.
She argued it was crucial for House members to directly dialogue with the evacuees and local officials of affected communities. 
“We are the House of the People. May our presence today, full force as you can all see, be a firm and gentle reminder that we are here for you, we emphatize for you… Ramdam namin lahat ng hirap at pangangamba [ninyo] (We feel your hardships and worries),” the Leyte 4th District congresswoman said. 
The session was ongoing as of posting time. – Rappler.com

Many residents living within the 14-kilometer danger zone surrounding the restive volcano are uncertain as to when they can go back to their normal lives. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far)
Some of them are at evacuation centers in nearby cities, while others have chosen to stay with their relatives. At least 11 towns are placed under total lockdown, and residents were no longer allowed to go back to these areas until further notice.
Currently, Alert Level 4 is raised over Taal Volcano. State volcanologists say that a major explosion may come within hours, days, or even months.
Here are some proposals on how to help the survivors in the short-term:
P30,000 cash aid
Senator Risa Hontiveros urged the Department of Social Welfare and Development to give at least P30,000 cash assistance to Taal Volcano eruption survivors, as President Rodrigo Duterte planned to seek P30 billion worth of supplemental budget from Congress for rehabilitation.
Hontiveros said that this should be in the form of cash aid and not a loan, as the evacuees' lives were temporarily halted because of the eruption.
Hontiveros acknowledged that the amount may not be enough to fully recuperate from the disaster. She said this should be regareded as an ""initial assistance,"" pending the post-disaster assessment by the government.
Loan amortization moratorium
Senator Sherwin Gatchalian is pushing for a one-year moratorium on loan amortization for residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption.
Gatchalian filed Senate Resolution No. 289 urging government financial institutions (GSIS, SSS, Pagibig) to extend loans to the victims and to freeze mandatory amortization payments within a year.
Suspend penalties on late tax payments to LGUs
Gatchalian also urged local governments to temporarily suspend imposition of penalties on the victims. He said that LGUs should be ""more lenient"" on payment of real estate property taxes, as well as the renewal of business permits.
Business permit renewals are usually done between January 1 and 20 every year. – Rappler.com

Records show that from January 15 to February 5, the Batangas provincial government received a total of P33,748,234.05 in cash donations.
""Marami pa ring fake news na nakakasira. 'Yung mga evacuees wala namang reklamo. Kung mayroon dapat pumansin at unang dapat dumaing...'yung mga napinsala. Ang unang dapat dumaing ay ang mga nagdo-donate kung hindi tama, subalit nakita naman nila na ginagawa natin [ang tama],"" Mandanas said on Thursday, February 6.
(There's fake news going around try to destroy the reputation of the provincial government. But the evacuees have no complaints. If there's anyone who should call our attention or complain...it should be those who were affected. The ones who can also complain are the donors if there's an anomaly, but they've seen that we're handling the funds properly.)
Mandanas also reiterated that he has not received any direct complaints from any municipal or city mayor.
""In fairness to the mayors, nauunawaan nila that they have a calamity fund, may direct din silang natatanggap from the national government, at mayroon din silang donations. Kung ayaw 'nyo gamitin ang calamity fund, ako ang magbibigay.  Kung may nagamit na kayo, I will reimburse,"" he added.
(In fairness to the mayors, they understand that they have a calamity fund, they also directly receive aid from the national government, and they also receive donations. If they don't want to use their calamity fund, the provincial government will provide money. If they've used it, I will reimburse.)
A few weeks ago, the League of Mayors sent a letter to Mandanas asking for P2 million in assistance for each municipality and city, a request that the governor said he would study.
As of Thursday, they were processing an advance of P200,000 each for the most affected municipalities of Agoncillo, Laurel, Lemery, Taal, San Nicolas, and Talisay.
""If you compare expenses, pinakamaliit sa lahat ang gastos sa quick response...rehabilitation malaki,"" Mandanas said.
(If you compare expenses, the smallest budget would be the one for quick response, and bulk would be for rehabilitation.)
Rehabilitation efforts
Mandanas said they are preparing temporary resettlement areas where evacuees can stay for 6 months to 2 years. The provincial government will continue supplying them with food and basic necessities while they are in these areas.
Rehabilitation will include the building of no less than 2,500 new houses for those who live within the 7-kilometer danger zone, and the setting up of their livelihood.
The Batangas provincial government owns several properties which are being eyed as relocation sites. These include 30 hectares in Ibaan, 600 hectares in Nasugbu, 400 hectares in Rosario, and a portion of land in San Juan. (WATCH: Temporary shelters eyed for residents displaced by Taal eruption)
""Kung saan sila sanay na livelihood, doon sila ilalagay (We'll relocate them to where they can resume their livelihood). For those who are used to fish cages, sa San Juan malaki ang frontage na may palaisdaan (San Juan has vast frontage for fisheries), so we can have fish cages there. In Ibaan, we can build a garment factory and nurseries for seedlings of high-value crops because they have agricultural lands,"" Mandanas said.
The governor gave an assurance that they will provide seed money to help affected residents get back on their feet.
A total of 83 schools will also have to be repaired or reconstructed in Batangas due to damage caused by heavy ashfall. (READ: Batangas sets up 'ash for cash' program for Taal eruption victims)

During a speech before affected residents in Sto Tomas City, Batangas, Duterte gave assurances that the government has enough money to respond to the needs of displaced residents as well as prepare for a hazardous eruption, which state volcanologists warned may still take place ""within hours to days.""
""I will ask Congress to expedite that will cover all you [need] – P30 billion would cover everything. Iyong tulong sa livestock, pati mga bahay. 'Yun man sigurong nakikita ko (That would include aid for livestock, housing. That's what I estimate),"" the President said.
Duterte also said there is a need to build evacuation centers in disaster-prone areas.
Missed priorities? Duterte's call for a ""supplemental budget"" comes as the government's calamity fund was slashed for the third year in 2020.
From P38.9 billion in 2016, the fund was reduced to P20 billion in 2019. Then in 2020, it was further lowered to P16 billion. (READ: Taal fiasco: Walang plano, kapos sa pondo)
Despite this, Duterte denied government response is lacking.
""There is money and we will just have to ask the National Treasury kung magkulang.... Itong pangyayari na ito, hindi naman kasali kasi sa budget. Hindi naman inakalain na puputok so baka magkaroon tayo ng supplemental budget sa Congress, but anyway, everybody is eager to help,"" he said.
(There is money and we will just have to ask the National Treasury if it's insufficient.... This incident was not accounted for in the budget. We did not know Taal was going to erupt, so we might have to pass a supplemental budget in Congress, but anyway, everybody is eager to help.)
A restive volcano: The ongoing Taal eruption started on Sunday, January 12. It remains on Alert Level 4, which indicates that a big explosion is imminent.
So far, the cost of agricultural damage in the region of Calabarzon is pegged at P3.06 billion after heavy ashfall blanketed various crops. (READ: How to stay safe during volcanic ashfall)

Human Settlements and Urban Development Secretary Eduardo del Rosario said in a media forum on Friday, January 24, that the government is already setting up the necessary infrastructure to provide water and electricity to the village initially intended for personnel of the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
Why is it unoccupied? Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas previously said that the housing project with 1,200 units was never used due to some ""legal issues,"" but various agencies have reached an agreement to temporarily utilize it as shelters for evacuees.
Del Rosario added that soldiers likely did not avail of the houses due to its small size. At 22 square meters, he said that soldiers are able to afford bigger units that are closer to Camp Aguinaldo.
""Halimbawa, sundalo ako, P200 a month ang hulugan pero malayo at may pera naman ako para mas malaki ang hulugan ko, bakit ako titira pa doon?"" he said.
(For example, I'm a soldier, amortization is only P200 a month but I have more money to spend and the location is far, why will I live there?)
Is it accessible? Ibaan, Batangas, is far from the identified danger zone, making it an ideal place to relocate, according to Del Rosario.
Del Rosario said that the village is accessible but not fit for police and military personnel because it is too far from their respective camps. He said the village may be a better fit for those displaced by the volcano's eruption.
He added that interested residents have the option to live there temporarily or permanently. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far)

Cavite,,"In the frenzy since Taal Volcano in Batangas started erupting more than a week ago, you’ve probably heard little news about Cavite, my home province.   
Batangas’ neighboring province to the north was mentioned as an aside in most reports: 
Away from blow-by-blow updates on social media, Cavite was in fact a story of quick, coordinated response to this unforeseen disaster. And the reason is, during days of calm, the province’s medical, social services, environmental, and emergency response teams do their work as if on a drill.

They do the rounds regularly – “Bumababa talaga sila. Kilala nila ang communities, alam nila ang kailangan doon,” a local who had worked with social workers told me. (They go down to the communities. They know the people there, they know what their needs are.) 
In past disasters, a provincial government employee said, these people would come to the capitol at 4 am, sometimes even earlier, every day until the situation returned to normal.   
A municipal official told me that Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla had been strict about local government units having well-equipped evacuation centers in strategic clusters of barangays that could be instantly activated when disaster strikes. 
 
HOW IS BATANGAS DOING?
 
So when Batangas was in distress – and it was inevitable that those fleeing their homes would spill into Cavite (and Laguna) – Cavite was prepared to respond.  
On January 15, the provincial board passed a resolution placing Cavite under a state of calamity. It also authorized Governor Remulla to accept, on behalf of the province, donations for the Taal survivors.  
There was “very little damage to property...outside of the ashfall,” Governor Remulla told Rappler, but the declaration was needed so they could allocate P15 million to help the evacuees from Batangas.  
When he spoke to us that day – 3 days into Taal Volcano’s continuing eruption – there were only about 15,000 evacuees from Batangas, only Alfonso and Tagaytay had taken in evacuees, and Dasmarinas City was to open its evacuation centers the following day. (WATCH: Taal Volcano evacuees arrive in Dasmariñas, Cavite)
Since then, the number of evacuees has more than tripled. As I write this, Wednesday afternoon, January 22, there are at least 12,617 families or 47,737 individuals from Batangas who have taken shelter in evacuation centers and foster homes in Cavite. All 23 municipalities and cities of Cavite are now hosting evacuees. 
EVACUEES from Batangas, initially accommodated in Alfonso town, are transferred to Dasmariu00f1as City.

So far, Cavite Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office head Louie Rozul told me: 
 
WHAT CAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO?

 
Thirty-four years ago, when the ticket of Cory Aquino and Doy Laurel was campaigning in our province for the 1986 snap elections, Doy the vice presidential candidate had an interesting way of telling us Caviteños how closely knit our province was with his Batangas: “Tayo naman sa Cavite at Batangas eh naghihilahang-kalabaw lang.” 
Literally, it translated to, “We in Cavite and Batangas would exchange carabaos.” It was a figure of speech for residents of the two provinces inter-marrying, therefore exchanging carabaos for dowry. 
With a big explosion still “imminent,” according to volcanologists, threatening Batangas more than any other province in Southern Tagalog, Cavite is pulling all stops to help its “family.” – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The House of Representatives is “willing” to nearly double the Palace-proposed P30-billion supplemental budget to fund relief and rehabilitation efforts following the Taal Volcano eruption in Batangas.
House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez made the announcement on Tuesday, January 21, a day after President Rodrigo Duterte asked Congress to pass a P30-billion supplemental budget to serve as aid to the volcanic eruption victims in Batangas and neighboring provinces. 
“If need be, the House leadership is even willing to increase the amount of the supplemental budget to as much as P50 billion for the sake of our kababayans there,” Romualdez said.
""We are going to coordinate with the Palace to get the full details of the supplemental budget,” added the the Leyte 1st District congressman.
The previous Aquino administration set aside a dedicated P26.84 billion fund to help assist victims and rehabilitate affected areas in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. 
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about P31 billion in government funds had been used for rehabilitation efforts in Central Luzon.
The House is set to hold its plenary session on Wednesday, January 22, at the Batangas City Convention Center in a bid to directly “listen” to the evacuees and first responders there. 
This is despite the Alert Level 4 still being raised over the Taal Volcano, which means a ""hazardous"" eruption is ""imminent"" or may occur ""within days to hours.”
Batangas, where the volcano is located, and its neighboring province Cavite are still under a state of calamity.
Thousands of residents from the two provinces remain in evacuation centers, while the cost of agricultural damage so far is at P3.06 billion. (READ: How to stay safe during volcanic ashfall)
House committee on rules donates P500,000
On Monday, January 20, ranking lawmakers who are part of the House committee on rules announced an initial  P500,000-donation for those affected by the Taal Volcano eruption.
Romualdez said their donation, which come from her own pockets, was meant to show the evacuees that the ""spirit of bayanihan is very much alive."" 
Senior Deputy Majority Leader Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla told Rappler that the P500,000 was pooled from the personal funds of several rules committee members, including Deputy Majority Leader Ria Fariñas, who represents Ilocos Norte 1st District, and Deputy Majority Leader Juan Miguel Arroyo of Pampanga’s 2nd District.
“We may give more,” said Remulla, who represents Cavite’s 7th District.
Remulla and Arroyo turned over the check to the following House rules committee members whose districts were affected by the eruption:

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – After 42 years, Taal Volcano erupted again.
The last time it erupted was in October 1977, though several incidents of volcanic unrest were recorded in 2011, 2012, and 2014.
The January 2020 eruption has affected thousands of families and caused millions-worth of damage just days after the initial eruption on January 12.
Here’s what has happened so far.
Taal Volcano started spewing ash Sunday afternoon, prompting the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) to raise its alert status to Level 2 at 2:30 pm. It was due to a “steam-driven” or phreatic eruption, according to Phivolcs, which happens when water beneath the ground or on the surface gets in contact with hot magma. (READ: FAST FACTS: Taal Volcano alert levels)
At 4 pm, Phivolcs raised the status again to Alert Level 3, indicating “magmatic unrest.” The ash column then had reached one-kilometer high.
Phivolcs raised the status to Alert Level 4 (hazardous eruption imminent) at 7:30 pm. The ash and rock fragments column reached up to 10-15 kilometers due to continuous eruption. There was also frequent volcanic lightning.
By Sunday night, ashfall from Taal Volcano had reached Calabarzon and Metro Manila. Several areas near Taal Volcano also experienced power outages due to ashfall, lava mud, and rocks.
Phivolcs observed lava fountains from Taal Volcano from 2:49 am to 4:28 am, but the alert status remained at Level 4. This was due to a magmatic eruption, which happens when gas within magma is decompressed and propels the magma forward.
At 3:20 am, ashfall was reported in the areas of Batangas, Tagaytay, Laguna, Cavite, Bulacan, Rizal, Muntinlupa, Las Piñas, Marikina, Parañaque, Pasig, Quezon City, Mandaluyong, San Juan, Manila, Makati City, and Taguig City.
Larger particles of rock fragments from the volcano were also reported in the areas of Tanauan and Talisay in Batangas, Nuvali and Sta Rosa in Laguna, and Tagaytay City.
The first confirmed casualty due to a road crash in Laguna was reported early Monday morning. Police said there was ""zero visibility"" at the time because of the ashfall.
In its 4 pm update, Phivolcs said “new lateral vents” opened up on the volcano’s northern side where short 500-meter lava fountains had been shooting out from. The agency further said a total of 144 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded in the Taal region since January 12, and warned that it may lead to “further eruptive activity.”
Batangas was placed under a state of calamity.
Phivolcs said surface activity of the Taal Volcano's main crater slightly eased, and fewer emissions were seen from Taal Volcano as of 1 pm.
However, the agency also said there was still continuous magmatic activity and frequent volcanic earthquakes, which indicated that a ""hazardous"" eruption was still a possibility. The alert status remained at Level 4.
Batangas authorities approved a lockdown of Talisay, which meant nobody was allowed to enter the municipality to return to their homes until the area is declared out of danger. 
In its 1 pm update, Phivolcs said lava fountains reached 800 meters high. New cracks on the ground were also spotted in the Batangas municipalities of Lemery, Agoncillo, Laurel, Talisay, and San Nicolas. A total of 335 volcanic earthquakes were recorded.
The volcano’s ongoing eruption generated dark gray columns of ash and hot magma, towering to an estimated 1,000 meters.  
In its 5 pm update, Phivolcs said portions of Pansipit River had dried up. A total of 520 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded since January 12. 
New cracks were also spotted on the ground in Batangas, particularly the areas of Sinisian, Mahabang Dahilig, Dayapan, Palanas, Sangalang, Poblacion, Mataas na Bayan, and Sambal Ibaba in Lemery; Pansipit and Bilibinwang in Agoncillo; and Poblacion 1, Poblacion 2, Poblacion 3, and Poblacion 5 in San Nicolas.
Authorities put the municipalities of Agoncillo, San Nicolas, Talisay, and Taal under complete lockdown, and imposed a partial lockdown on Lemery. 
 At least 3 Taal evacuees in Batangas died due to cardiac arrest.
Cavite, Batangas’ neighboring province, was placed under a state of calamity. The alert status remained at Level 4. 
Taal Volcano showed “weak” emission but “intense” tremors persisted as magma was still rising.
Phivolcs said a total of 9 “discrete weak explosions” were recorded from 9 am to 5 pm. The agency also said they were looking at the possibility of a lull for a considerable period of time.
The total number of earthquakes since January 12 rose to 595 as of 5 pm, but no additional cracks on the ground were reported. Alert status remained at Level 4. 
Alert Level 4 stayed, as a hazardous eruption remained possible within hours to days.
But the Taal Volcano Network recorded a downtrend in volcanic earthquakes, from 944 to 420 events per day between January 17 and 24. There was also a decline in the daily total seismic energy released.
Phivolcs downgraded Taal Volcano’s status to Alert Level 3, but said the unrest has not yet stopped and that people should remain cautious.
Phivolcs explained the reason for the downgrade was the “overall decrease in the level of monitoring parameters,” which included less frequent volcanic earthquakes, weaker steam or gas emissions at the main crater, and the slowdown of ground deformation.
Alert Level 3 means there is now a ""decreased tendency towards hazardous eruption."" – Rappler.com

Though the threat of a hazardous eruption is not yet being ruled out, the downgrading was a chance for families to check on what they left behind. Returning was easier for those with vehicles.
""Dineclare naman 'yan sa TV pero pansamantala lang dahil baka 'di raw...sigurado ng [Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology] kung puputok ba o hindi. Eh di kami nagdesisyon na ring pamilya na umuwi muna kami. Lilinisin ko muna ito,"" said Ramuel de Claro, a resident of Lemery.
(It was announced on TV, that's the situation for now since Phivolcs can't say for certain if the volcano will erupt or not. So my family decided to come home. I'll clean here first.)
De Claro and his family returned to a house with volcanic ash everywhere. They started to clean the walls and the street outside their house. But the amount of ash on their roof was just too much for them to clean in one day.
The Batangas provincial government said residents may choose to come home if their area is no longer on lockdown, but evacuation centers are still open for those whose houses were damaged.
Rappler went around the previously locked down areas within the 14-kilometer danger zone and saw that only a few residents had gone home. The areas still looked like a ghost town, particularly Talisay.
De Claro, who stayed at his daughter's house in Makati City, said his family who came with him to Lemery left him by evening. He'll be alone in their Lemery home until state volcanologists declare that Taal Volcano will no longer erupt.
What would he do if Alert Level 4 is raised again?
""Tatakbo. Ay, patigasan na lang ng dibdib. Wala na tayong magagawa,"" said De Claro. (I'll run. I just need to be brave. There's nothing we can do about the eruption.)
Meanwhile, Mataasnakahoy residents got excited the moment they heard about the lowering of the alert level.
""Nakakainip na nakakapagod maghintay na makauwi. Parang kayo'y pagod na pagod kahit nakaupo lang.... Kaya nung sinabing makakauwi na, ang sarap ng feeling!"" said a resident who refused to be named.
(It's boring and it's tiring to wait to be able to come home. It's like being so tired even if you're not doing anything.... That's why when they said we could return home, it felt so good!)
Melisia Manalo, 63, is among the Mataasnakahoy residents who went home on Sunday. Her family used to live on the volcano island in the 1970s – the last time Taal erupted before its 2020 unrest.
Should the alert level be raised again, Manalo said they will immediately gather their things to evacuate anew.
""Hindi matigas ang aming ulo dahil kaligtasan po ang habol namin,"" she said. (We won't be hardheaded because we want to be safe.)
Government service
The municipality of Taal, meanwhile, provided government vehicles to fetch residents.
Rommel Capuno, 32, said they started cleaning the classroom they were staying in at Banaba East Elementary School in Batangas City the moment they heard the news.
""Nung nalaman naming pwede nang bumalik kami po'y agad nag-ayos ng mga gamit. At saka tuwang-tuwa po ang aming mga kababayan na taga-rito at nababa na nga 'yung [alert level], at nag-open na 'yung lockdown,"" Capuno said.
(When we learned that we could come home, we immediately fixed our things. People from our town were also very happy that the alert level has been lowered and there's no more lockdown.)
Capuno said there were trucks from police in Canlubang City, Laguna, that brought the residents in batches to the Taal municipal hall. From there, vehicles from the municipal government brought them to their houses.
Taal Mayor Fulgencio Mercado said the municipality borrowed vehicles from other local government units to augment theirs.
According to Mercado, evacuation for their town came as a ""shock,"" as Taal had always been hosting evacuees. They weren't used to fleeing, and because of that, it took them 3 days to evacuate residents who were unwilling to leave the town.
If the volcanic unrest escalates again, Mercado said evacuation may be faster the next time around.
""Siguro naman mas mabilis na ngayon, kasi before talaga nabulaga kami,"" the Taal mayor said. (I think it would be faster next time. Before, we were really shocked.)
Still on lockdown
At least 11 towns had been placed on total lockdown when Alert Level 4 was raised over Taal.
Now, with a smaller danger zone of 7 kilometers from the main crater, only Taal Volcano Island, Agoncillo, and Laurel remain on lockdown. But Laurel residents have been given window hours of 11 am to 5 pm. (READ: LIST: Batangas towns, cities where lockdowns are lifted as Taal down to Alert Level 3)
According to Laurel police manning a checkpoint, only the barangays of Gulod and Buso-Buso are highly vulnerable. Gulod, they said, is prone to landslides, while Buso-Buso is nearest to the volcano.
On Sunday, Gulod resident Bonifacio Cortez traveled to their home from Alfonso, Cavite, where their evacuation center is located. He said he can't let their animals die.
""Kaya po kami nauwi dahil po ang aming alagang hayop, sayang naman po. Kung mamatay man ay wala naman pong mananagot do'n, eh di kung kami din lang po,"" Cortez said.
(We came home because we need to take care of our animals. If they die, no one else would be responsible for that but us.)
Cortez couldn't be bothered even if their house stands within the 7-kilometer danger zone.
""Kami po ay okay lang po kahit nandito lang po kami dahil wala naman pong pagyanig o mahina naman po ang lindol,"" he said.
(We're fine even if we're staying here within the danger zone because we don't feel any earthquakes, or if we do, they're just weak.)
Thousands of homes, however, may have been damaged in the past two weeks, according to Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas. The extent of the damage will still be assessed.
Phivolcs has cautioned that now is not yet the time to relax, since the Taal unrest is not completely over. The volcano started erupting on January 12 and the situation rapidly progressed, catching even state volcanologists by surprise. – with a report from Tina Ganzon-Ozaeta/Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) in Calabarzon has deployed health emergency personnel, provincial health teams, and mental health teams to areas in Batangas, even as it placed all health facilities in the region on full alert following the eruption of Taal Volcano in Batangas on Sunday, January 12.
This means that all DOH facilities should be ready to provide medical help for people with traumatic injuries, burns, suffocation, skin diseases, eye injuries, conjunctivitis, and respiratory problems. 
DOH Calabarzon is also monitoring possible fatalities after heavy volcanic ashfall in areas close to the volcano.
In a media release on Monday, January 13, the DOH Calabarzon said it would also distribute free N95 face masks to residents in high-risk areas. 
Batangas has been placed under a state of calamity on Monday. 
Calabarzon region is comprised of the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon, and the highly urbanized city, Lucena.
DOH Calabarzon regional director Eduardo Janairo reminded affected people with existing health conditions like emphysema, asthma, and bronchitis who have been exposed to ashfall to immediately seek medical help. (READ: How to stay safe during volcanic ashfall)
 Volcanic ashfall is a major health hazard that follows volcanic eruption. It may cause eye, nose, and throat irritation and lead to difficulty in breathing, coughing, bronchitis-like illnesses and minor skin problems.
Janairo further advised the public to:
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has raised Taal Volcano's status to Alert Level 4. It also warned that a ""hazardous"" eruption may occur ""within hours to days.” 
As of this posting, ashfall has spread to Calabarzon and even Metro Manila, prompting local executives to suspend classes and government to suspend work.  
As of 12 noon Monday, January 13, a total of 5,458 families or 24,508 people are reported to be taking shelter in 75 evacuation centers in Batangas, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).  
The NDRRMC said that aside from N95 masks, the DOH has also provided collapsible jerry cans (for water storage), eye drops, and water disinfectants for victims of the eruption. – Rappler.com"

DSWD spokesperson Irene Dumlao said they discussed recovery and rehabilitation plans in a meeting in Batangas City last Saturday, January 18. These include emergency cash transfers, emergency shelter assistance, and rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure through food-for-work or cash-for-work programs.
Dumlao also said they are coordinating with other government agencies to fill in ""critical gaps in livelihood,"" particularly in agriculture.
As for the respective needs of each affected area, Dumlao said they are assessing how to help local government units in providing appropriate aid to their constituents.
Dumlao also reminded the public who want to donate or hold private relief operations to coordinate with the DSWD donations management section, which can be reached at 83552849, local number 401.
According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), there are at least 53,716 families affected by the eruption as of noon on Monday. (READ: Taal Volcano eruption: What we know about affected towns, cities)
Are there enough funds?
Office of Civil Defense Assistant Secretary Casiano Monilla said there are sufficient funds to assist evacuees, and more could be tapped as needed.
""Enough naman ang pera. Kung na-deplete ang pera ng NDRRMC o allocated funds, ang alam ko, merong P3 billion pa rin [na] allocated standby fund ang gobyerno,"" said Monilla.
(The money is enough. If the NDRRMC's money or other allocated funds get depleted, I know there is a P3-billion standby fund allocated by the government.)
There is a P16-billion calamity fund under the 2020 budget, with an additional P11 billion unused from 2019. This leaves a total of P27 billion for use during calamities, since the validity of the 2019 budget was extended to this year.
The DSWD earlier called for donations of non-food items due to a deluge in food donations received by evacuation centers in Batangas.
Volcano's current status
In the same press briefing, Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Director Renato Solidum Jr said they cannot lower Taal's alert level just yet. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far)
He said they observed an increased level of sulfur dioxide emission, which means that more magma is underneath. Water under the volcano is heated by the magma and has potential to explode.
""Hindi namin puwedeng ibaba ang Alert Level 4 sa patuloy na pag-akyat ng magma. May mga apparent waning of activities sa ibabaw, [pero] hindi makikita ng tao 'yung maraming paglindol at umaangat pa ang isla. May pressure 'yan. 'Di masasabi na hindi mangyayari ang pagsabog,"" said Solidum.
(We can't lower Alert Level 4 as magma continues to rise. There is an apparent waning of activities at the surface, but volcanic earthquakes and volcanic deformation are factors that aren't visual. There's pressure there. We can't say that a hazardous eruption will no longer happen.) – Rappler.com

Duterte says he'll 'eat ashfall, pee on Taal Volcano'",,"MANILA, Philippines – Despite warnings from his doctor about the potential hazard of volcanic ashfall, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would visit communities affected by the Taal Volcano eruption on Tuesday, January 14.
Duterte, in his first public appearance since the Taal Volcano started erupting on Sunday, January 12, was asked if he was fit enough to visit areas affected by ashfall.
""Kainin ko pa 'yang ashfall na 'yan, pati 'yang Taal ihian ko 'yan, bwisit na 'yan (I’ll eat that ashfall, even Taal, I’ll pee on it, goddamn it),"" Duterte said on Monday, January 13. 
Gesturing to the inhaler strung around his neck, he said, ""I've been warned by my doctor to be careful because this device cannot control the ashes. After many years of smoking, my lungs are affected.""
Duterte said this much to reporters after the awarding of the Order of Lapu-Lapu to soldiers who served in Marawi on Monday, January 13. During the ambush interview, he said he would visit people affected by the Taal Volcano eruption on Tuesday.
Because of health problems, Duterte has had to skip several official engagements and has been out of the public eye for several weeklong periods. The President has admitted to a slew of ailments, including previous spinal issues caused by past motorcycle accidents.
The Taal Volcano in Batangas remained under Alert Level 4 on Monday, as it spewed lava fountains amid the threat of a hazardous eruption.
To date, at least 24,508 people have fled their homes in the provinces of Batangas and Cavite, with evacuees scattered in at least 75 evacuation centers. 
Price cap on face masks
Duterte also said he wants to set a limit on the prices of face masks after reports of people hiking up prices of the protective gear.  
Concerned Filipinos took to social media Monday to express frustration over people taking advantage of the calamity to make a profit out of the protective gear. N95 masks are respirators that block out at least 95% of very small particles. They usually cost only P25 to P30, but some were seen selling them for as high as P200.
""I am not surprised because these businessmen, if the demand is high, then the prices go up. Or the worst thing they can do [is] if they have enough supplies and they're selling it at prohibitive prices,"" Duterte said.  
He said he would meet with Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to discuss setting a price limit on the item. 
It is the Department of Trade and Industry, however, that is in charge of price concerns. The agency issued a statement Monday saying it would ""not hesitate to file administrative and criminal charges"" against those found to be selling face masks at hiked prices.  
The City of Manila began its crackdown on stores allegedly selling overpriced anti-particle masks. The Manila Bureau of Permits has been ordered to look into reports of hiked prices.
Aside from possible revocation of permits, the Consumer Act's Section 52 bans unfair or unconscionable sales act or practice, prohibiting sellers from exploiting buyers based on ""physical or mental infirmity, ignorance, illiteracy, lack of time or the general conditions of the environment or surroundings.”
Violators can be fined from P500 to P10,000 or be imprisoned from 5 months to a year. – Rappler.com"

SANTA CRUZ, California — A wildfire was raging outside, but inside the evacuation centers there were risks, too.
Natalie Lyons and Craig Phillips had to make a decision Thursday morning as they sat in their ash-coated Toyota Tundra under the smoky orange sky in Santa Cruz.
After fleeing the small town of Felton on Wednesday as a series of wildfires continued to burn along the central coast of California, they sought refuge at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, an evacuation site, but the building was full — and Lyons was scared of contracting the coronavirus in an enclosed, indoor space.
“There’s some people coughing; their masks are hanging down,” said Lyons, 54, who said she had lung problems. “I’d rather sleep in my car than end up in a hospital bed.”
So that is exactly what the couple did. Their car served as a makeshift bed across the street from the auditorium, and Lyons tried to get comfortable in the back seat with their Chihuahua-terrier mix and shellshocked cat. “I hardly got any sleep,” she said.
More than 25,000 people have been forced to evacuate from the rural areas of San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, Cal Fire said, and many have struggled to find a place to go, especially with the pandemic still limiting indoor gatherings.
At least five hotels in Santa Cruz said they were filled to capacity Wednesday night as evacuees sought refuge from the smoke outside. And midday Thursday, Santa Cruz County urged tourists and other visitors to leave so displaced residents could find a bed to sleep in. Even places set up specifically to house evacuees were forced to turn people away because of the need for social distancing, which Jessi Bond, the Civic Auditorium supervisor, called “heartbreaking.”
“There’s really two emergencies happening, and we need to address both,” she said.
A man who lived on Pleasants Valley Road in Solano County was found dead during a damage assessment Thursday, Sheriff Tom Ferrara said in a Facebook video. And at least two others have died in the firefighting effort: A helicopter pilot on a water-dropping mission was killed in a crash in Fresno County, and a worker for Pacific Gas and Electric who had been clearing electrical lines was found unresponsive in his vehicle in Solano County.
The wildfires, caused by an extraordinary period of lightning strikes, continued to rage throughout California on Thursday, burning more than 300,000 acres in the state. One group of fires, the LNU Lightning Complex in Napa Valley, grew to 131,000 acres and destroyed more than 100 homes and other buildings, many of them in Vacaville, near Sacramento. Fire officials said Thursday that they were hopeful they had stopped the fire from spreading further into the city, but more than 30,000 buildings remained threatened.
East of Silicon Valley, a grouping known as the SCU Lightning Complex grew to more than 137,000 acres — nearly the size of Chicago — but has largely been kept away from more populated areas, and firefighters have contained a small portion of it.
The central coast fires in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, called the CZU August Lightning Complex, severely damaged California’s oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods.
The Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office has ordered nearly 28,000 people to leave their homes because of the fire, which swelled to about 40,000 acres Thursday and remains completely uncontrolled. The University of California, Santa Cruz, campus was placed under a mandatory evacuation order Thursday night, hours after university officials urged anyone on campus to leave voluntarily.
In Santa Cruz, about 40 people were sheltering inside the Civic Auditorium, but Bond said more than twice that many could have been admitted if spreading the virus was not a concern. Inside, evacuees were dealing with the realities of being forced together during a pandemic: masks at all times and temperature checks at the front door.
Those who were permitted to stay used tents that were spaced throughout the auditorium, a far cry from the dense array of cots that dotted the floor when the building was used as a shelter after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.
“I’m not sure if tent fabric is preventive against COVID,” Bond said. “But again, just giving people that barrier, that kind of more shelter-in-place type situation rather than being in back-to-back-to-back cots.”
Evacuees further up the coast near Pescadero slept in trailers in parking lots or on the beach overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Others made desperate pleas to family members and friends to take them in, and local authorities said they preferred that people assimilate into so-called quarantine pods rather than brave the virus risks of an indoor shelter. Experts have said the risk of catching the coronavirus is much higher indoors, where still air and enclosed spaces can cause viral particles to concentrate and be inhaled.
Cenaida Perez said she smelled smoke from her house in Vacaville early Wednesday morning and ran outside with her 3-year-old daughter, Adriana. She is sheltering at a nearby library but said she was worried about the coronavirus.
“Who isn’t going to be scared of that virus? It has killed so many,” Perez, 36, said in Spanish. “But also, I don’t want to die like this, burned to death.”
At the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds in Watsonville, another evacuation site, RV owners set up camp in parking lots, while others slept in their cars or pitched tents on grass fields amid the smoke. Rachel Muñoz said that she, her husband and two children took a chance and slept in a tent inside a fairground building after evacuating the town of Ben Lomond.
“If I get COVID, it’s probably going to be here,” she said.
But there was not much room to sleep in her pickup truck, which was already occupied by 16 chickens and the pine shavings they nest in.
“These are my babies,” said Muñoz, 51, while rigging netting to the back of her truck so she could leave the door open and give her hens some fresh air.
Even far from the fires, the air smelled like smoke, and ash flakes covered cars and backyards.
The air quality around the Bay Area remained dangerously unhealthy in some places Thursday. In Concord, northeast of Oakland, the air quality index surpassed 200, meaning the air was “very unhealthy.” The index can reach 500, but anything above 100 is considered unhealthy, particularly for people who have breathing complications.
People should avoid going outside at all, especially to exercise, while the air quality is in the unhealthy range, said Dr. Afif El-Hasan, a lung health specialist in Orange County. He said the smoke could also make people more vulnerable to the coronavirus if they were infected.
“Anything that weakens the lungs, like really bad air, which causes the lungs to lose some of their ability to fight infection, is going to be an issue,” El-Hasan said. “In theory, breathing in a lot of bad air can make you more susceptible to a more serious COVID illness.”
The double risk of dangerous air and the coronavirus poses a dilemma, El-Hasan said, making decisions for evacuees even more difficult.
Back in Santa Cruz, Lyons and Phillips, her boyfriend, were planning their next move. Phillips, 65, called one hotel after another, as far away as Monterey, but they all said the same thing: Sorry, we’re full.
He packed his guitars, and she brought pet supplies and DVDs of her daughter’s childhood. The couple said they will be living out of their cars for the foreseeable future.
Phillips, who retired from his job with a Bay Area air quality agency in April, said the past few months have been far from the easy life he had hoped for.
“I retired into the pandemic and now homelessness,” he said.

MANILA - The disaster agency said Tuesday it was verifying reports that an earthquake that struck the central Philippines left at least one dead.
The Masbate police reported that the magnitude 6.6 tremor destroyed the house of one of its retired personnel, said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council spokesperson Mark Timbal. 
""Kinukumpirma po natin kung nasawi iyong isa pong kababayan natin d'yan. Pero ang nakarating po sa atin, may one possible casualty,"" he told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo. 
(We are confirming if our compatriot there died. But the information that reached us is there is one possible casualty.) 
The NDRRMC also received reports that the quake destroyed some houses made of light materials, said Timbal. 
Stockpiles of relief aid are ""ready for transport,"" he said. 
Tuesday's tremor was caused by a movement of the Philippine Fault and could spawn aftershocks, said the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. 
Residents who will evacuate from their homes should observe health protocols to avoid the spread of the novel coronavirus, said NDRRMC's Timbal.

Taal Volcano’s steam emission early Tuesday was “normal”, the country’s chief seismologist said, following online posts raising concern over the incident.
The volcano has let out steam every day since it erupted in January, said Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) Director Renato Solidum.
“Paminsan-misan nagbabago iyong volume o dami ng usok na lumalabas pero iyon po ay normal na obserbasyon sa Taal Volcano kasi hindi naman po madami iyong earthquake,” he told ABS-CBN’s TeleRadyo.
“Ang kailangan lang sa state na ito, wala po tayong nakikitang hazardous explosive eruption,” he added.
(Sometimes the volume of the steam changes, but that is a normal observation in Taal Volcano because the earthquakes there are few. What is important is that there are no signs of a hazardous explosive eruption.)
Taal belched a “weak” steam plume 20 meters into the sky, which drifted south-southwest. The volcano in the past 24 hours spawned 5 quakes, Phivolcs said in an 8 a.m. advisory.
Set in a picturesque lake south of the capital, Taal blanketed parts of Luzon in ash, drove tens of thousands into evacuation centers and left billions of pesos in damage to agriculture during its January eruption.
Taal remains under alert level 1, which means sudden steam-driven or phreatic explosions, volcanic earthquakes, minor ashfall, and lethal accumulations or expulsions of volcanic gas can occur, said Phivolcs.

MANILA (7th UPDATE) - Panicked throngs rushed out of buildings in Masbate on Tuesday morning after a magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck the province and rattled neighboring areas, leaving at least one dead. 
The tremor hit 5 kilometers southwest of Cataingan town at 8:03 a.m., said the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. 
Phivolcs initially reported the quake's magnitude at 6.5, which it later upgraded to 6.6. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured the quake at magnitude 6.7.
""There are a lot of damaged houses,"" said Staff Sgt. Antonio Clemente in Cataingan, which lies west of the Samar Sea. 
""It was really strong.""

A retired policeman was killed and several others were injured after his 3-story house collapsed in Cataingan, police said. 
Local radio reporter Christopher Decamon said he saw emergency workers pull the man's body from the rubble. The man's wife escaped unharmed.
The earthquake ""was really strong. Our people were broadcasting at the time but they just ran out of the building,"" Decamon told Agence France-Presse by telephone.
A video posted on Facebook and verified by AFP shows light damage to a food market in Cataingan. Overturned buckets and small fish were scattered on the ground and chunks of cement had fallen from a pillar. People stood outside on the street.
Philippine Red Cross chairman Sen. Richard Gordon tweeted photos taken by his colleagues showing buildings in Cataingan with corrugated iron roofs fallen in.

AFTERSHOCKS LOOM 
A movement in the Philippine Fault Zone caused the quake, said Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum. 
This fault's northern portion last moved in 2003, triggering a magnitude 6.2 quake in Masbate, Solidum told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo. 
Tuesday's tremor will not cause a tsunami because the fault moved horizontally instead of vertically, he said. However, the quake is expected to spawn aftershocks and damage to property, Phivolcs said.
""Iyong possibility na magkaroon pa ng mas malaking magnitude na earthquake, hindi natin puwedeng alisin. Pero most likely, karamihan d'yan ay mas maliit na,"" Solidum said.
(We cannot remove the possibility of another earthquake with a greater magnitude. But most likely, most of the aftershocks will be weaker.) 
So far at least 14 aftershocks have been recorded by the Philippine seismology office, with the strongest registering at a magnitude 3.5.

At a depth of 1 kilometer, the quake was felt at a ""destructive"" intensity 7 in Cataingan. This intensity can strongly shake trees, overturn heavy furniture, ring church bells and crack roads, hollow block walls and dikes, said Phivolcs. 
Neighboring town Pio V Corpus also felt the tremor at Intensity 7, according to its local disaster official Mary Grace Barlizo. Two residents were given medical assistance, she said.
Residents were advised to stay in open areas as authorities have yet to assess damage to their homes, Barlizo said. The town's risk reduction and management office will hold an emergency meeting later Tuesday, she added.
""Yung iba, ina-advise pumunta sa identified evacuation center pero syempre dun sa open area muna kasi yung aftershocks po palagi po,"" she told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
(Some are advised to go to identified evacuation center and stay in the open area due to often occurring aftershocks.)
A ""strong"" intensity 5 shaking that can rock parked vehicles and make hanging objects swing was felt in Masbate City, and Almagro and Tagapul-an in Samar, said Phivolcs.

The quake was felt at a ""moderately strong"" intensity 4, which is like the passing of a heavy truck and may cause a rumbling sound, in these areas: 
Palanas, and San Jacinto, Masbate; Sorsogon City; Legazpi City, Albay; San Andres, Quezon; Mapanas and Palapag, Northern Samar; Barugo, Dagami, Dulag, Julita, La Paz, Palo, and Tanauan, Leyte; and Sagay City, Negros Occidental.

The quake was felt at a ""weak"" intensity 3 in Baybay City, Isabel, Javier, and Kananga in Leyte; Ormoc City; Mulanay, Quezon; and Iloilo City. 
Phivolcs likens this intensity to the passing of a light truck. It can be felt indoors especially in upper floors of buildings and may cause dizziness.

The quake was ""slightly felt"" at intensity 2 in Guinayangan and Lopez, Quezon; President Roxas, Capiz; Patnongon, Patnongon, San Jose de Buenavista, and Tibiao, Antique. 
Lezo, Aklan and Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental felt the quake at a ""scarcely perceptible"" intensity 1.

PANIC IN THE STREETS 
Government employees rushed out of the Iloilo provincial capital and the labor department office in Legazpi City, videos from reporters on the ground showed.

In Tacloban and Palo in Leyte, some residents reported experiencing nausea and seeing power lines swaying. 
""It was strong, dizzying,"" police Col. Eric Dampal from Iloilo City told Agence France-Presse. ""Almost everyone inside buildings rushed to the streets. Up to now, they're still outside."" 
In nearby Palanas town, police chief Captain Alvin Guerina said several patients, including a pregnant woman about to go into labor, were evacuated from a hospital as a precaution in case of aftershocks.
Homes in poor rural areas of the Philippines are often made from lightweight material such as wood.
 
USGS said in a statement however that ""there is a low likelihood of casualties and damage."" 
""Recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as landslides and liquefaction that might have contributed to losses,"" it added. 
Damaged houses should be inspected by authorities before residents use them again, said Solidum. 
The quake struck as the archipelago battles surging numbers of coronavirus infections, with more than 164,000 cases and restrictions on movement that vary across the country.
A lockdown affecting a quarter of the population, including the capital Manila, will be eased Wednesday. 
The Philippines is situated on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
A 6.8-magnitude quake struck the southern island of Mindanao in December, killing at least 3 people, injuring dozens and damaging buildings. It hit as the island was still recovering from a string of deadly quakes in October.

PORT LOUIS - A ship that has leaked more than 1,000 tons of oil in pristine waters off the coast of Mauritius has split in two.
The bulk carrier MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef off the southeastern coast of Mauritius on July 25 and began oozing oil more than a week later, threatening a protected marine park boasting mangrove forests and endangered species. 
Mauritius declared an environmental emergency and salvage crews raced against the clock to pump the remaining 3,000 tonnes of oil off the stricken vessel. 
""It was confirmed on August 15 that the vessel has broken into two,"" the ship's operator Mitsui OSK Lines said in a statement Sunday, noting that the information came from the vessel's owner, Nagashiki Shipping.
The split was caused by a crack in a cargo hold at the vessel's stern, Mitsui said.
Officials had been bracing for the development for days, and images taken Saturday indicated it was inevitable, with the two pieces only partly attached. 
'Worst ecological disaster'
Nearly all the remaining 3,000 tons of oil had been pumped off the ship by that time, though there were still 90 tonnes on board, much of it residue from the leakage. 
Mitsui noted Sunday that ""an amount of unrecovered oil is believed to have leaked out of the vessel,"" without elaborating.
Thousands of Mauritians have volunteered day and night to clean the powder-blue waters that have long attracted honeymooners and tourists. 
The spill is both an environmental and economic disaster for Mauritius, which relies heavily on tourism.
The spill already qualifies as the Indian Ocean island nation's ""worst ecological disaster"", Greenpeace Africa campaigner Happy Khambule said, adding that it ""puts unique species under immediate threats"". 
Now that the ship has split, the salvage team intends to pull the front two-thirds out to sea using two tugboats to avoid further damage to the Mauritian coastline, a police official in the capital Port Louis told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media.
The remaining portion is still stuck on the reef and officials have not yet determined how they might remove it, the official said.
That portion includes the ship's engine room, which still contains 30 cubic meters of oil, and rough weather will complicate efforts to pump that oil out, according to a statement Sunday from the Mauritian crisis committee formed to respond to the spill.
The crisis committee expects rough weather for the next five days, ""with high energy swells of a maximum height of 3.5 metres (11 feet)"", the statement said. 
Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has come under fire, including from opposition leaders, for doing too little after the ship ran aground. 
His government has vowed to seek compensation from the owner and the insurer of the ship for ""all losses and damages"" caused by the spill as well as clean-up costs. 
Nagashiki, the owner, has pledged to ""sincerely"" respond to requests for compensation over damage to the marine environment. 
Japanese Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Saturday he planned to dispatch a team of environment ministry officials and other experts to Mauritius to ""swiftly assess what the ministry can do"".
Tokyo sees the disaster ""as a significant crisis that could result in the loss of biodiversity,"" he told reporters in Tokyo on Saturday.
Global clean-up effort
France is also contributing to the relief effort, and Sebastian Lecornu, minister of overseas territories, visited Mauritius Sunday to supervise the team sent to help mitigate the effects of the pollution.
He stopped first in the nearby French overseas department of La Reunion, and warned that some oil could reach there.
""We remain vigilant about the fate of the wreck and the impact on our coasts,"" he said on Twitter. 
After visiting Mauritius, Lecornu returned to La Reunion late Sunday and said he believed the clean-up initiative would involve ""at least 10 months of work"", describing it as ""a titanic job that will be quite formidable"". 
A 10-member team from India's coastguard also arrived in Mauritius on Sunday with 28 tonnes of equipment including booms, barges and skimmers. 
As of Sunday more than 800 tons of oil liquid waste and more than 400 tonnes of solid waste sludge and debris had been removed from the ocean.

At least 16 people were killed Friday when a passenger jet overshot and skidded off the runway as it landed in southern India, breaking into two pieces, officials said.
Dozens of people were injured, 15 of them seriously, after the Air India Express Boeing 737 originating from Dubai touched down in Kozhikode in heavy rain.
The airline said more than 190 passengers and crew were on board the plane that, according to the aviation ministry, plunged 10 metres (35 feet) down a slope off the end of the raised so-called table-top runway.
Television footage showed the fuselage of the jet ripped apart and surrounded by emergency personnel working in the dark, spraying the wreckage with water although there was no sign of any fire.
Sakeen K., the district medical officer in the nearby city of Malappuram, said that 16 people had died.
""We are still ascertaining the toll,"" she told AFP.
Kozhikode official Seeram Sambasiva said that the two pilots were among the dead.
Senior local policeman Abdul Karim told AFP said that another 15 passengers ""have critical injuries. It is still a developing situation.""
""We have at least 89 people, many of them with serious injuries, admitted at different Kozhikode hospitals. The ambulances are still coming in,"" said Sujith Das, another senior police official.
""We have been told that all those who have survived the crash also have some form of injuries.""
Aviation regulator DGCA said the plane skidded off the end of the runway and ""fell down in the valley and broke down in two pieces"".
Four people were still stuck inside the plane. media reports said.
One television channel reported there had been a problem with the jet's landing gear.
Air India Express said in a statement that there was ""no fire reported at the time of landing.""
It said there were 174 passengers, 10 infants, two pilots and five cabin crew on board the aircraft.
- Coronavirus repatriation -
The plane was one of dozens in recent weeks to repatriate some of the thousands of Indians left stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic, many of them in Gulf countries.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences.
""My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover at the earliest... Authorities are at the spot, providing all assistance to the affected,"" Modi said.
The last major plane crash in India was in 2010 when an Air India Express Boeing 737-800 from Dubai to Mangalore overshot the runway and burst into flames.
The crash killed 158 people and left eight survivors.
Kerala has been battered by heavy rains in recent days.
At least 15 people were killed on Friday after a landslide triggered by heavy rains flattened a row of huts elsewhere in the state.
Around 50 other people were feared trapped in the debris. The dead included two children.

MANILA - Powerful typhoons can become a form of ""coronavirus superspreader"" if typhoon victims will be crammed in evacuation centers, where physical distancing is impossible, Sen. Ralph Recto warned Thursday. 
In a statement, Recto said the government needs to give frontliners a ""timeout"" to recalibrate plans for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to prepare for the typhoon season.
The ""two-week good weather window"" should be used to stockpile food and prepare strategies to avoid cramming typhoon victims in evacuation areas.""
""They have no room for another class of disaster victims, unless we bend the curve and reduce the space occupied and resources used by COVID 19 victims,"" the senator said.
The government's resources ""have been stretched so thin"" due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so the Philippines has to prepare ""because in our vulnerable state, we cannot be one strong typhoon away from hunger,"" he said.
The Philippines is one of the countries most prone to disaster with at least 20 typhoons entering its area of responsibility annually, Recto said.
""We can pray for good weather, but let us prepare for a bad typhoon season,"" he said.
""That we will be fighting simultaneously at two disaster fronts is a certainty,"" he said.
As of August 6, the Philippines has become the COVID-19 epicenter of southeast Asia with 119,460 cases.

MANILA - The number of Filipinos killed by a cataclysmic blast in Beirut has doubled to 4, the Department of Foreign Affairs said Friday, as the Lebanese capital counted its dead and cleared streets of debris.
The higher death toll ""comes as our Embassy personnel work to ascertain the condition of the Filipinos in its jurisdiction,"" DFA Undersecretary Sarah Lou Arriola said in a statement.
The DFA said 31 other Filipinos were among thousands injured in Tuesday's blast at Beirut's port that ravaged entire neighborhoods, costing the country billions.
Two Filipinos were in critical condition and one household worker was missing, said the agency.
""Our Embassy officials shall continue to ascertain the condition of our community in Beirut. The DFA reaffirms its commitment to bring the much needed support and assistance to our kababayans specially at this hour of need,"" Arriola said.
Lebanese authorities said the massive explosion was triggered by a fire igniting 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at Beirut's port.
But many questions have been raised as to how such a huge cargo of highly explosive material could have been left unsecured for years.
Lebanon's foreign minister announced Thursday that an investigating committee had been given 4 days to determine responsibility for the devastating explosion.
Yet most of the members of this committee are high-ranking officials who command little trust from the people and many relatives of the blast's victims have been calling for foreign investigators.
The explosion -- which left an estimated 300,000 people temporarily homeless, injured around 5,000 people, and killed around 130 -- struck when Lebanon was already battling rampant inflation and rising poverty.

MANILA (UPDATE) - A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck Maguindanao early Sunday, Phivolcs said.
The tremor was upgraded from an initial measurement of magnitude 6.1.
It struck 13 kilometers southeast of Cotabato City at 1:08 a.m., state seismologists said.
The earthquake, which was tectonic in origin, was not almost felt due to its depth of 543 kilometers, according to Phivolcs. 
No damage was reported in Cotabato City but the public is advised to be alert for possible aftershocks, the local disaster risk reduction office said.

MANILA - The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management has P200 million in standby funds as the country braces for rainy season during the COVID-19 pandemic, its spokesman said Tuesday.
The Philippines gets hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year. The country's first and only storm yet this year was Ambo (international name: Vongfong), which left at least 6 dead and displaced 140,000 others.
""Unique po ito dahil kakaharapin natin 'yung panahon ng pag-ulan at bagyo nang may kasabay na pandemic,"" NDRRMC spokesperson Mark Timbal told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo.
Under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, local governments are allowed to use all of their quick response fund for emergencies, Timbal said.

JAKARTA - Indonesia's most active volcano Mount Merapi erupted Friday, shooting a column of ash some 5,000 meters (16,000 feet) into the air in its second major eruption this month.
Ash and sand covered areas several kilometers (miles) away from the peak of the rumbling crater near Indonesia's cultural capital Yogyakarta.
But authorities did not raise Merapi's alert level.
""There has been no reports of damage from the eruption. We urge people to stay calm and not panic,"" national disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.
Merapi erupted earlier this month, shooting a massive ash cloud some 6,000 metres in the air.
That eruption coated Yogyakarta and neighboring city Solo with grey dust and forced an airport closure.
Mount Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of 280,000 residents.
That was Merapi's most powerful eruption since 1930, which killed around 1,300 people, while another explosion in 1994 took about 60 lives.
The Southeast Asian nation -- an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and islets -- has nearly 130 active volcanoes.
It sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", a vast zone of geological instability where the collision of tectonic plates causes frequent quakes and major volcanic activity.

MANILA - It's a bitter reality coffee lovers in the Philippines may have to swallow.
The country's specialty coffee, kapeng barako, is in danger of becoming extinct after thousands of its trees were damaged by Taal Volcano's eruption, industry officials warned Wednesday.
""There is a danger of extinction because barako is primarily grown in Batangas and Cavite. Right now, we have to do some risk management by saving the species,"" said Philippine Coffee Board Inc. (PCBI) president Pacita Juan.
Cavite and Batangas, which produce about 90 percent of the country's barako, were among the areas affected by the January 12 eruption.
The volcano belched a towering plume of steam and ash, which blanketed some 4,309 hectares of coffee farms, data from the Department of Agriculture (DA) showed. 
Many trees did not survive while others would take at least 2 years to recover. Some 5,000 small farmers also stand to lose their livelihood.
""We're taking a long-term positive step to protect the species... We want to protect that sort of trademark coffee that is so attached to the Philippines,"" the board's director Guillermo Luz said.
The Philippines is only 1 of 4 countries that produce barako, which comes from the Liberica variety, he added. Other Liberica beans come from Malaysia, Vietnam and Ethiopia.
In order to reproduce barako, which is known for its strong flavor and sharp aroma, the board plans to use one-third of the harvestable coffee in Cavite and Batangas as seedlings to be planted in other areas, such as in Mindanao.
""It's a crisis but a unique opportunity... We've taken a hit but we have a plan to recover and expand the production areas,"" Luz said.
Some 15,000 barako seedlings stored in a private farm in Alfonso, Cavite were also spared, the board revealed.
Ash-coated trees will also be cut up for it to regrow and bear coffee cherries again under a ""rejuvenation program.""
SUPPLY SHORTFALL
The PCBI, however, warned consumers they might have to get their caffeine kick from other varieties for now.
Since the coffee industry in Cavite and Batangas took a major hit from the eruption, supplies are expected to dwindle due to the production loss of about 40 percent.
Prices may also soar for barako, which is currently being sold at P250 per kilo, said PCBI director Alejandro Mojica.
It would also take around 2 years for the industry to significantly recover, he added.
""The harvest next year is already affected,"" Mojica said.
In total, coffee farmers will lose around 5,000 metric tons of green coffee beans worth around P600 million, said Rene Tongson, also PCBI's director.
If converted to roasted products, it would amount to more than P1 billion, he added.
""Old farmers also started to lose interest and might go to planting other crops... Not only do we have to rehabilitate the trees, we also have to rehabilitate their mindset,"" Tongson said.
The board is set to meet with the DA to discuss measures that will help growers recover their losses and for the industry to recover.
COFFEE CONSUMPTION
The Philippines, an ideal place to grow quality coffee, produces some 35,000 metric tons of green coffee beans annually, Juan said.
Filipinos also consume 150,000 metric tons of coffee annually, which could translate to 120 million cups of coffee, she added.
""The demand for coffee is strong. The consumption is rising, but production is dwindling, if not plateauing,"" Juan added.
To fill the huge gap, the country imports coffee products from Vietnam and Indonesia.
The Philippines grows 4 commercial varieties of coffee—Robusta, which is mainly used for instant coffee; Arabica, which sells at premium price; Excelsa; and Liberica (kapeng barako.)
Mojica considers Barako, in particular, as laborious variety because it grows in climate with a distinct dry and wet season.
It is also cultivated in areas with an altitude of between 250 to 800 meters and soil with ""plenty of organic matter,"" he added.
""Mahirap pa siyang kunin tapos kunti pa ang binubunga, pero doble naman ang presyo,"" Mojica said.
Coffee was introduced in Lipa, Batangas in 1740 by a Spanish Franciscan monk, according to the PCBI.
From there, it was then cultivated in other parts of Batangas before reaching Cavite in 1870.

MANILA - Two Cabinet members of President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday dissuaded senators from creating a ""super department"" that will oversee disaster response and resilience programs in the Philippines, saying the proposed agency might ""cannibalize"" other offices.
Secretaries Eduardo Año of the Interior department and Fortunato Dela Peña of the Science and Technology department expressed their views during the Senate's hearing on bills that seek to create a new department for disaster response.
At least 14 senators have pushed the proposal, with some of them recommending that existing agencies like the Bureau of Fire Protection and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council be absorbed by the new agency.
""Parang mas marami yung advantages kung authority na lang siya, rather than cannibalizing other departments,"" Año told reporters on the sidelines of the hearing.
(""There are more advantages if it'll just be an authority, rather than cannibalizing other departments."")
""A plus to one [department] is a minus to other departments. There will be some overlapping also of functions and probably some conflict in existing law,"" he added.
Dela Peña expressed his reservations before the senators about transferring state weather forecasters and seismologists into the proposed department.
""While they are mandated to predict and forecast, they also have a mandate to exploit the aspect of exploring opportunities in a volcanic terrain... or to collect data and provide information for the benefit of the agriculture industry,"" Dela Peña said of the state weather and state seismology offices.
""Honestly, we have to give a chance to the NDRRMC... I would prefer that we maintain the NDRRMC,"" he said.
FASTER RELEASE OF FUNDING
Senator Bong Go is among those pushing for the creation of the new department, saying this will hasten the release of disaster funds.
""Ang tagal po ng proseso ng pag-download natin ng pera. Ang haba-haba ng calamity fund process flow. Baka mamaya, ilang linggo pa bago ma-release yung pondo,"" he said.
(""It takes a long process for us to download the funds. The calamity fund process flow is very long. The funds could be released several weeks later."")
""There is nothing wrong with changing how our bureaucracy works if the goal is to make the delivery of government services more efficient, more effective and more responsive,"" added the longtime aide of Duterte.
Having a Disaster Resilience Department will also streamline meetings and the decision-making process, said Senator Francis Tolentino, who was Duterte's former disaster point person.
But Undersecretary Ricardo Jalad, Administrator of the Office of Civil Defense and Executive Director of the NDRRMC, said the lawmakers' concerns may be addressed by simply ""strengthening"" the NDRRMC.
""Sa gitna kasi ng NDRRMC ngayon, nandun yung OCD headed by an Undersecretary. Siya yung overall orchestrator... So we can just strengthen the orchestrator,"" he said.
(""At the core of the NDRRMC now is the OCD, headed by an Undersecretary. He is the overall orchestrator."") 
P1.7-B PRICE TAG
The Senate Committee on National Defense and Security will hold another hearing before deciding on the creation of the new department, the panel's chair, Senator Panfilo Lacson, said.
The chamber must consider that government will have to spend at least P1.7 billion just to create the new office, he said.
A new department will require at least P595 million for salaries, another P299 million for maintenance and operating expenses, and P173 million for capital outlay, among others, data from the Department of Budget and Management showed.
Senators Imee Marcos and Cynthia Villar also expressed reservations about the proposed department's funding requirement.
""Mauubos kasi sa suweldo ng mga undersecretary kapag department agad,"" Marcos said in the hearing.
(""If it's a department right away, the funds will be all go to the salaries of the Undersecretaries."")
Funds should instead be allocated to enhance existing programs, Villar noted in an earlier interview.
""Ano ba mas mabuti: mag-create ka na lang ng programs to solve the problem or mag-create ka ng department at gamitin sa overhead [expenses] yung pera? It's their decision,"" she said.
(""Which is better: creating programs to solve the problem, or creating a department which require funds for its overhead expenses?"")
Surrounded by waters and lying in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world, a 2017 study showed.

ELAZIG, Turkey — Hopes faded Sunday of finding more survivors from a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey as more bodies were pulled from the rubble and the death toll climbed to 35.
Nearly 4,000 rescue workers combed through debris in freezing temperatures, helped by mechanical diggers, in vain hopes of finding anyone alive in the city of Elazig.
Three bodies were found in the city center, 38 hours after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck Friday evening, bringing the death toll to 35 in Elazig province and nearby Malatya, Vice President Fuat Oktay said.
Rescuers carefully cleared the remains of the collapsed 4-story building where the bodies were found, using buckets to remove broken material as a sniffer dog was brought to the scene.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters that workers were searching for 6 people still under the rubble of the building.
Residents nervously waited to find out what happened to their relatives. A group of women burst into tears when they learnt that the body of a relative was found, while one woman fainted, an AFP photographer said.
Nearby a Red Crescent official tried to calm down another woman whose cousin was missing, urging her to be patient. ""We are doing everything we can.""
So far, the authorities say 45 people have been rescued alive but it is believed 14 people are still under the rubble in the region, according to NTV broadcaster.
The government's disaster and emergency management agency (AFAD) said 1,607 were injured including 104 still in hospital, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.
There was growing concern for residents amid the bitter cold, said Hasan Duran, a 58-year-old shopkeeper, who lives in Sursuru.
""If it was summer, people could maybe resist a little longer. But with this cold, it's hard to imagine. Even we are freezing at home. May God give them strength"".
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday ""every effort was made to ensure citizens whose homes have collapsed or been damaged will not suffer in this winter period.""
He added every type of assistance was ""swiftly"" provided to the affected region from rescue workers to vehicles.
MOTHER, TODDLER FOUND ALIVE 
The epicenter of the quake was in the small lakeside town of Sivrice in Elazig province, and also affected neighboring cities and countries.
With a population of around 4,000, Sivrice is located south of Elazig city on the shores of Hazar lake -- one of the most popular tourist spots in the region.
The US Geological Survey said the magnitude was 6.7, slightly lower than AFAD, adding that it struck near the East Anatolian Fault in an area that has suffered no documented large ruptures since an earthquake in 1875.
There had been elation on Saturday when Ayse Yildiz and her 2-year-old daughter were found alive by rescuers after 28 and 24 hours respectively.
Nearly 80 buildings collapsed while 645 were heavily damaged in Elazig and Malatya provinces, AFAD said in a statement.
Erdogan had promised Saturday during a visit to Elazig that Turkey's housing agency TOKI would ""do whatever is necessary and make sure no one is left without a home"".
Residents avoided returning to their homes because of aftershock fears. They included Mustafa Top who said he would ""wait a week while the aftershocks continue and then we'll check (our apartment).""
Since Friday's quake, there have been 714 aftershocks with 20 above 4 in magnitude.

ISTANBUL, TURKEY - A powerful earthquake has killed at least 20 people and injured more than 1,000 in eastern Turkey, as rescue teams searched through the rubble of collapsed buildings for survivors on Saturday. 
At least 30 people were missing following the magnitude 6.8 quake on Friday night, which had its epicenter in the small lakeside town of Sivrice in the eastern province of Elazig.
""It was very scary, furniture fell on top of us. We rushed outside,"" 47-year-old Melahat Can, who lives in the provincial capital of Elazig, told AFP.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said all steps were being taken to aid people affected by the quake, which caused widespread fear.
""We stand by our people,"" Erdogan said on Twitter.
The Turkish government's disaster and emergency management agency (AFAD) said the quake hit Sivrice at around 8.55 pm (1755 GMT). Turkey lies on major faultlines and is prone to frequent earthquakes. 
Turkish television showed images of people rushing outside in panic, as well as a fire on the roof of a building.
Interior, environment and health ministers, who were in the quake zone, said the casualties were in Elazig province and in the neighboring province of Malatya, which lies to the southwest.
At least 20 people died and 1,015 others were wounded, according to AFAD.
""There is nobody trapped under the rubble in Malatya but in Elazig search and rescue efforts are currently under way to find 30 citizens,"" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Friday.
Rescue teams were searching for survivors trapped in a five-story collapsed building in a village some 30 kilometers from Elazig, according to AFP journalists at the scene. One person was pulled alive from the rubble.
Emergency staff and people waiting at the scene lit fires in the streets to stay warm in freezing temperatures.
Sports centers, schools and guest houses had been opened to accommodate quake victims in Malatya.
'Everybody is in the street' 
Sivrice, a town with a population of about 4,000 people, is situated south of Elazig city on the shores of Hazar lake -- one of the most popular tourist spots in the region and the source of the Tigris river.
The lake is home to a ""Sunken City,"" with archaeological traces dating back 4,000 years in its waters.
The tremor was felt in several parts of eastern Turkey near the Iraqi and Syrian borders, the Turkish broadcaster NTV reported, adding that neighboring cities had mobilized rescue teams for the quake area.
""Everybody is in the street, it was very powerful, very scary,"" said Zekeriya Gunes, 68, from Elazig City, after the quakes caused a building to collapse on her street.
""It lasted quite long, maybe 30 seconds,"" added Ferda, 39. ""I panicked and was undecided whether to go out in this cold or remain inside.""
The US Geological Survey assessed the magnitude as 6.7, slightly lower than AFAD, adding that it struck near the East Anatolian Fault in an area that has suffered no documented large ruptures since an earthquake in 1875.
""My wholehearted sympathy to President @RTErdogan and the Turkish people following the devastating earthquake that has hit Turkey. Our search and rescue teams stand ready to assist,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wrote on Twitter.
In Athens, the Greek premier's office said later that Mitsotakis had spoken by phone to Erdogan.
""The Turkish president... said Turkish teams had the situation under control for now and that it would be re-evaluated in the morning,"" his office added.
In 1999, a devastating 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Izmit in western Turkey, leaving more than 17,000 people dead including about 1,000 in the country's largest city Istanbul. 
In September last year, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Istanbul, causing residents to flee buildings in the economic capital.
Experts have long warned a large quake could devastate the city of 15 million people, which has allowed widespread building without safety precautions.

Typhoon Ambo destroyed some tents that COVID-19 patients used at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute, a doctor there said Tuesday.
The tents from the social welfare department are used to isolate COVID-19 patients and also as makeshift nurses' station. Bigger military-grade tents are used for the outpatient dialysis of patients suspected of having the respiratory disease, said the hospital's ancillary operations head Dr. Mike Jaro.
""Hindi ito natinag ng bagyo: itong malalaking tent. Ang naapektuhan na mga tent ay iyong mga galing sa DSWD na emergency shelter lang,"" he said.
(The big tents withstood the storm which affected the tents from the DSWD that are used as emergency shelter.)

MANILA (2nd UPDATE) - Typhoon Ambo (international name: Vongfong) hit land for the sixth time on Friday morning and moved south of the capital, as pandemic protocols complicated the evacuation of tens of thousands in coronavirus-stricken Luzon.
The first storm of 2020 made its sixth landfall over San Andres, Quezon at 7:45 a.m., packing maximum sustained winds of 125 kilometers per hour and 165 kph gusts, said the state weather bureau.
At 10 a.m., the storm approached Laguna and Quezon provinces, south of Metro Manila, said PAGASA.
At 10 AM today, the eye of Typhoon #AmboPH was located in the vicinity of Catanauan, Quezon. #AmboPH has maximum sustained winds of 125 km/h near the center and gustiness of up to 165 km/h. It is moving Northwest at 20 km/h. | @dost_pagasa

Moderate to heavy with at times intense rains will hit Bicol Region, Quezon, Aurora, Marinduque, Laguna, Rizal, Metro Manila, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino, said the agency.
The following areas were placed under signal no. 3, where winds may blow off roofs made of medium strength materials such as timber and galvanized iron:
Signal no. 2, where winds of 61 to 120 kph may damage poorly constructed signs/billboards and down wooden or old electric posts, was hoisted over the following areas:
Signal no. 1 was raised in the following areas, where rice crops may suffer significant damage and some banana plants may be tilted:
Ambo earlier made landfall in Eastern Samar, Dalupiri and Capul islands in Northern Samar, and Ticao and Burias islands in Masbate.
Provincial and city governments, many of which are already strapped for resources due to the outbreak, are grappling with logistical and space issues, with an estimated 200,000 people needing evacuation from flood and landslide-prone areas.
The health department requires a one-meter distance between evacuees.
In Albay, shelters accepted only half their capacity while evacuees in churches were asked to sleep one bench apart to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Hundreds of evacuees in neighboring Buhi, Camarines Sur, were given face masks before they were allowed in the evacuation centers.
Camarines Norte also used COVID-19 resources and re-aligned funds from other projects to feed up to 15,000 evacuees, said incident management commander Atty. Don Culvera.
The storm also knocked down power and communication lines in the whole Northern Samar, where some 10,600 people evacuated, said provincial disaster chief Josh Echano. Authorities, he said, had yet to receive reports of any resident killed or missing due to Ambo.
Moving northwest at 15 kph, Ambo is expected to leave the Philippine area on Tuesday.

MANILA -- Two people were killed after the Philippines' strongest typhoon so far this year, Tisoy (Kammuri), tore through Luzon, shutting the capital's main airport, displacing thousands and causing blackouts.
A man fell while clearing his backyard while the second fatality was hit by the collapsed kitchen roof, Oriental Mindoro Governor Hurmelito Dolor told ANC.
The Ninoy Aquino International Airport was shut at 11 a.m. due to anticipated ""destructive"" winds of up to 120 kph. Some 480 flights were affected by the closure, which was scheduled to last until 11 p.m., authorities said.
Classes in all levels and work in government offices were suspended in areas on the path of Tisoy, which slammed into the Sorsogon province on the southern tip of the Bicol Peninsula late Monday night with up to 275 kph gusts.
Some events in the 30th Southeast Asian Games were postponed. The Philippines' fourth hosting of the biennial sports fest will run until Dec. 11.
Tisoy crossed the Sibuyan Sea before slamming into Mindoro Island Tuesday afternoon with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph and 195 kph gusts, weakening from the initial landfall. It was the strongest storm so far this year in terms of wind speed, PAGASA forecaster Anna Clauren told ABS-CBN News.

The storm was forecast to bring ""continuous heavy to intense rains"" in Southern Luzon, Central Luzon and Metro Manila for most of Tuesday afternoon and ""frequent to continuous heavy with isolated intense rains"" until Wednesday morning, weather bureau PAGASA said.
""The wind is howling. Roofs are being torn off and I saw one roof flying,"" storm survivor Gladys Castillo Vidal told AFP. ""We decided to stay because our house is a two-story made of concrete... Hopefully it can withstand the storm.""
In Santa Margarita, Samar, 2 people were hurt after they were hit by storm debris while another was hit by a collapsed wall. Landslides and floods were reported in Motiong and Jiabong towns in Samar, and Lapinig and Mapanas in Northern Samar.
In Albay, the airport in the capital city, Legazpi, was damaged. Some 100,000 were evacuated to escape the threat of lahar, big waves, floods and landslides, said the province's disaster office head Cedric Daep.
The Filipino-Chinese consortium that operates the Philippines' power grid, NGCP, said Tuesday it was prepared to restore its infrastructure in case of damage.
The NGCP prepared pre-fabricated blocks and steel pieces that can be used to rebuild fallen towers ""in just a few days,"" said National Grid Corp spokesperson Cynthia Alabanza.
The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, killing hundreds and putting people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.
The country's deadliest cyclone on record was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.

MANILA (UPDATE) -- Thousands fled to storm shelters, fishermen moved their boats to shore and Metro Manila's giant billboards were folded up on Monday, as the Philippines braced for powerful typhoon Tisoy (Kammuri) during its hosting of the Southeast Asian Games.
In the capital city, Manila, which is hosting some SEA Games events, a giant Christmas tree was wrapped in red cloth in preparation for Tisoy's winds, which were gusting at 180 kph as of Monday afternoon.
Tisoy, the 20th typhoon to enter the Philippine area this year, was forecast to hit land in Catanduanes, Albay or Sorsogon in the northeast peninsula of Bicol late Monday or early Tuesday, weather bureau PAGASA said.
At least 43 flights were canceled Monday and classes in all levels were suspended Tuesday in parts of Metro Manila and other areas on the storm's path.
""Dapat alerto po tayo, bantayan po natin, tutok po tayo sa ating mga updates... Sana ay hindi muna tayo magre-relax,"" said PAGASA Administrator Vicente Malano.
(We should be alert and monitor updates... I hope we don't relax.)
President Rodrigo Duterte opened the SEA Games last Saturday along with champion boxer and Sen. Manny Pacquiao. Organizers said some outdoor events could be rescheduled due to bad weather.
In Virac, on the eastern island province of Catanduanes, palm trees swayed due to wet winds as Tisoy neared. The weather bureau said the storm could take the same path as Glenda (Rammasun), which killed some 100 people in July 2014.
Thousands were evacuated in Albay, home to the Mayon Volcano due to the threat of lahar flows, flood, storm surge, and landslide, said Cedric Daep, head of the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office.
""Medyo masama na po ang panahon natin, nararamdaman na po ang malamig na hangin at patak-patak na ulan,"" Eric Ferrer, disaster council spokesman in Camarines Norte.
(The weather is turning bad. We can feel the cold winds and it's starting to rain.)

SHANGHAI, China - Super Typhoon Lekima slammed into southeastern China early Saturday, bringing torrential rains and heavy winds that knocked out power, downed thousands of trees and forced more than 1 million people from their homes, state media reported.
The monster storm made landfall in the early hours in Wenling City packing winds of 187 kilometers per hour, and was expected to churn up the east coast towards Shanghai, Xinhua news agency said.
More heavy rain was forecast for the Shanghai area as well as the eastern provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with authorities warning of possible flash floods, mudslides and landslides caused by the downpours.
In Zhejiang province alone, nearly 300 flights were cancelled, and ferry and rail services were suspended as a precaution.
More than a quarter of a million people were relocated in Shanghai, where the high-speed maglev train that links the city to one of its airports was suspended.
More than 110,000 people were housed in shelters.
China issued a red alert as the storm approached on Friday, before downgrading the level to orange as winds eased on Saturday morning.
The storm had earlier swept past the northern tip of Taiwan on Friday, where nine people were injured, thousands of homes lost power temporarily and more than 500 flights were canceled.
It also caused heavy rains in parts of the Philippines for several days, enhancing the southwest monsoon. 
Last September, Typhoon Mangkhut slammed into mainland China where authorities evacuated more than 2 million people, after it left a trail of destruction in Hong Kong and Macau and killed at least 59 people in the northern Philippines.

MANILA -- (UPDATE) Typhoon Rosita (Yutu) maintained its strength, on course to slam into northeastern Luzon ahead of the All Souls' Day rush, the state weather bureau said Sunday.
Rosita will likely hit the Cagayan-Isabela area on Tuesday morning. It will stir moderate to heavy rains in Northern and Central Luzon as early as Monday afternoon, PAGASA said.
""Flooding and landslides are possible. Travel by land and sea is risky,"" PAGASA said. Storm surges are possible in coastal areas of Cagayan and Isabela, it said.
Public storm warning signals may be raised by Sunday evening, the weather bureau said. The lowest warning, signal number 1, could be raised in Metro Manila on Monday.
Strong to very strong winds will hit the eastern coast of Northern and Central Luzon from Tuesday morning, PAGASA said. Sea travel will be ""risky"" over the northern and eastern seaboards of Luzon and the Samar provinces, it said.
Rosita was spotted 875 kilometers east of Aparri, Cagayan at 11 a.m. Sunday, packing maximum sustained winds of 200 kph with 245 kph gusts, and mowing west at 20 kph, PAGASA said.
It was forecast to be at 460 km east northeast of Casiguran, Aurora by Monday morning, in the vicinity of San Mariano, Isabela by Tuesday morning, 200 km west of Sinait, Ilocos Sur by Wednesday morning and outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility by Thursday morning, PAGASA said.
Powerful typhoon Ompong lashed Luzon in late September, inundating farmlands and triggering landslides that killed at least 75 people.
Rosita is projected to hit land 2 days before the All Saint's Day and All Soul's Day holidays, when millions of Filipinos are expected to troop to cemeteries to offer flowers and prayers for their loved ones.
As Yutu, Rosita struck US islands in the Pacific last week, causing blackouts and massive infrastructure damage.

MANILA - (UPDATED) Typhoon Mangkhut continues to gain strength as it approaches the Philippine area of responsibility, the state weather bureau said Wednesday.
In its 11:00 a.m. advisory, PAGASA said Mangkhut has intensified further, packing 205 kph winds and gusts of up to 255 kph.
""Ito na ang so far ang pinakamalakas na bagyo na dumadaan sa ating bansa ngayong taon. Sikapin po natin na ito ay paghandaan nang mabuti,"" said Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary Renato Solidum in a press conference. 
(This is by far the strongest typhoon to hit the country this year. Let us prepare for this.)
PAGASA said the typhoon, which was last spotted 1,190 km east of Guiuan, Eastern Samar, is expected to enter PAR Wednesday afternoon. It will be named Ompong once it enters PAR. 
Senior weather specialist Chris Perez warned of ""very strong winds"" and 6-meter high storm surges in coastal areas in the path of the typhoon, particularly in Cagayan and Isabela, by Friday and Saturday.
He said the state weather bureau may begin raising cyclone warning signals over the affected areas on Wednesday afternoon. 
PAGASA said Mangkhut, now with a diameter of 900 km, is expected to reach peak intensity of around 220 kph max sustained winds and gusts of up to 270 kph. 
A tropical cyclone with top sustained winds of 220 kph is classified by PAGASA as a super typhoon. 
Mangkhut is expected to enhance the southwest monsoon which will bring heavy rains on Wednesday to Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Siquijor, Surigao del Norte, Agusan del Norte, Dinagat Island, and Lanao del Sur.
PAGASA Administrator Vicente Manalo said because of the intensity of the typhoon and the habagat, Manghut may match or exceed the torrential rains caused by Tropical Storm Ondoy in 2009. 
""Kung may habagat siya plus 'yung ulan mismo na nanggagaling sa bagyo, puwede siyang tumaas. Puwedeng abutin niya si Ondoy or lampasan niya si Ondoy,"" Manalo warned.
(With the monsoon rains combining with rains coming from the typhoon itself, Mangkhut may match or exceed the Ondoy's rainfall.)
Hundreds of people were killed during the onslaught of Ondoy in 2009 due to flash floods in Marikina, Pasig and other parts of Metro Manila and nearby provinces. ​

MANILA (UPDATED) - Local officials have placed Cagayan de Oro under a state of calamity following floods brought by typhoon Vinta. 
Vinta had submerged parts of the southern city in knee-deep floods days before Christmas, forcing some residents to climb onto rooftops as they waited for rescuers. 
Under a state of calamity, local officials can tap Cagayan de Oro's P120-million emergency funds for the evacuees and impose a price freeze on basic commodities. 
The city council wants to use part of the funds to purchase 4 water tanks, said social welfare officer Teddy Sabuga. 
Water supply has yet to be restored to a large part of the city after the floods damaged the pumping stations of he local water district. 
 
Vinta left 420 people dead across the southern Philippines and sent tens of thousands to evacuation centers.
Harry Roque, President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesperson, has vowed continued government aid to the affected communities. 
The deadliest storm to hit the country was Yolanda, a super typhoon, which killed thousands and destroyed entire towns in the central islands in November 2013.

LONDON - Fatalities and economic losses from severe weather are rising in many of the world's poorest countries as climate change and a lack of disaster preparedness worsen threats, risk experts said.
Over the last 35 years, 60 percent of weather-related deaths globally were among people who earn $1,000 a year or less, said Ernst Rauch, a strategy expert at German reinsurance firm Munich Re.
Those deaths - from disasters such as storms, floods, extreme heat, droughts and forest fires - happened largely in some of the world's poorest countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Nepal, Somalia, Madagascar and Mozambique, Rauch told a London conference on climate change this week.
Many of these countries are also seeing the biggest losses from severe weather as a percentage of their GDP, Rauch said.
A 2017 ranking by Verisk Maplecroft, a British risk analysis firm, put 50 countries in its ""extreme"" risk category, with poor and hurricane-exposed nations in the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia among the most vulnerable.
The figures show countries that develop national strategies to curb risks from extreme weather are faring better as climate change strengthens and disasters ratchet up, Rauch said.
""Addressing risk from a governance perspective is key. If not, every disaster leads to a further drop in economic development,"" he said.
One measure that has worked well in many parts of the world is strengthening building codes. Buildings that can stand up to high winds or flooding can help reduce both deaths and economic losses, Rauch said.
Insurance is another way to limit risks, he added, alongside shifting to hardier crops, using irrigation, building levies or moving flood-threatened people out of harm's way - an often controversial move.
But many risk-cutting efforts face challenges of their own, said experts at Chatham House, a British policy think tank.
Irrigation, for instance, may become harder to manage in places where groundwater supplies are disappearing, and levies, dykes and other infrastructure to manage flooding can fail, as happened in New Orleans with Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The role of insurance in managing growing losses may also reach its limits if hugely devastating storms, floods and droughts become more frequent and offering cover no longer makes business sense, the experts said.
Puerto Rico's insurance industry is likely to struggle under the weight of expected losses from hurricanes Irma and Maria, which last month pushed down the stock prices of major insurers on the island, noted the experts in London.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, richer nations have promised to raise $100 billion a year in funding starting from 2020 to help poorer nations cope with climate change impacts and adopt clean energy.
Countries are also working to set up an international mechanism to address unavoidable ""loss and damage"" from climate change. That mechanism is expected to be a major focus at U.N. climate talks in Bonn in November, following a year of record hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters.
But promised climate aid may not meet growing needs, particularly with major donors such as the United States pulling back from funding promises, the experts said.
Another challenge is that ""climate finance"" is being defined so broadly that, in Rauch's view, ""not all the money is really making its way to reasonable solutions"".

MANILA - Like a scene from a disaster movie was how overseas Filipino worker (OFW) Robelita Sabado Gallardo described the twin explosions that shook Beirut, Lebanon Tuesday night.
In an interview on ABS-CBN's Teleradyo Wednesday, Gallardo said it was the worst thing to ever happen after living in the Middle Eastern nation for 20 years.
""Twenty years na ako dito at halos nakita ko na lahat. Ito 'yung pinaka-worst na nakita ko in front me. Not in my wildest dream na mangyari ito,"" she said.
Gallardo, a household service worker, said she was at her employer's house when an explosion in Beirut's port occurred past 6 p.m that sent a plume of smoke over the capital skyline. 
It was later followed by a larger blast that rocked their condominium building, a kilometer away from the port warehouses that stored a stockpile of highly explosive ammonium nitrate.
""Akala mo 'yung nanonood ka ng sine na it's happening in front of you . . . then makikita mo na nag-slow motion 'yung pangyayari,"" she said.
When they evacuated, she saw collapsed buildings as streets were covered in debris and hospitals swamped with the injured.
For Gallardo, the picturesque Lebanese capital has transformed into a war zone.
""Beirut is a very, very nice place. It's like a small haven. Maganda talaga siya. Mga tao rito, kung ikumpara mo sa ibang Middle East na mga bansa, open sila rito,"" she said when asked what attracted thousands of Filipinos to work in Lebanon.
""Para kang nasa Pilipinas. You can do whatever you want as long as wala kang inaapi. Suweldo dito ay dollars naman kaya ako nagtagal.""
Gallardo, who is raising 2 children with her Turkish husband in Lebanon, said she has yet to make a decision on whether to stay or leave the city.
""Parang ang hirap kasi. Sa totoo, for now, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to think kasi may mga anak ako na isaalang-alang dito,"" she said.
The blast that tore through Lebanon killed more than 100 people and injured over 4,000 others.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Wednesday 2 Filipinos died from the incident while 8 were injured. Eleven seafarers and a household service worker also remained missing.

Three days of monsoon rains have killed at least 90 people and damaged at least a thousand homes across Pakistan, the country’s national disaster management agency has said.
Streets and homes were flooded with sewage water in Karachi on Tuesday, where the city’s outdated drainage and waste systems were overwhelmed by another spell of heavy rain.
Of the total rain-related casualties, 31 deaths were reported in southern Sindh province, while 23 people died in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the agency. 
It said 15 deaths were reported in south-western Baluchistan province and eight in Punjab province. Thirteen more people died elsewhere in the north of the country, including three in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir.
Troops, rescuers and volunteers from the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik were seen evacuating people from inundated residential neighborhoods in Karachi as some families waded through waist-high water. Hundreds of people were forced to take shelter in the houses of relatives in the country’s largest city.
According to the disaster agency, troops using boats evacuated 300 people from rain-hit district of Dadu in Sindh province, while 1,245 people were evacuated from Karachi’s rain-hit areas, where residents said they were still waiting for help.
Scores of vehicles were seen submerged in water in Karachi.
The rains are expected to continue this week in Karachi, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, earlier this month sent troops to help local authorities in pumping out rainwater from inundated residential areas.
Monsoon rains are lashing Pakistan at a time when authorities are trying to contain the spread of the coronovirus, which caused more than 6,200 deaths since February when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more Covid-19 deaths Tuesday, one of the lowest numbers of daily fatalities since March.
Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September."

Outside Magazine has published a heartbreaking letter from someone whose home located in the woods north of Santa Cruz was incinerated by the CZU Lightning Complex Fires. 
The letter is authored by marine biologist Wallace J. Nichols and is addressed to his daughter. 
We built your home around you when you were still inside your mother.
We built it stronger and more sturdy than it needed to be. I thought a lot about every piece of wood and stone. Every knob and switch. We filled it with our books, musical instruments, and interesting animal bones. I imagined you looking down after a bath through the railing upstairs.
The fire, which is now 15% contained, has destroyed 18 homes and other structures and damaged six. It burnt down all of Nichols’ home except for a stone chiminea. Read the full story here.

For more context into the dry, hot conditions that preceded the massive wildfires in California: July 2020 was the second warmest month on record, globally.

As summers get hotter and weather gets more severe, “megafires” like those we are seeing now in California will become more common. In California in particular, vegetation was parched from a relatively dry rainy season. When it was struck by lightning, it quickly was set aflame.

California Fire Foundation
Others:
American Red Cross: online donations can be specifically directed to “California Wildfires”.
United Way of Northern California: The United Way is involved in programs for people affected by wildfires, including long-term recovery operations.
GoFundMe: The fundraising website has launched a “California Wildfire Relief Fund”. There are also pages for specific wildfire-related losses and other fundraisers including a memorial fund for a pilot who died when his helicopter crashed while dropping water on fires, and another to protect field farm workers, largely immigrants who are working in unsafe and smoky conditions as the fires rage on. 
Facebook: The social media company launched its own fundraiser on Tuesday, offering to match up to $500,000 in donations to the Red Cross.

Fires in California have now charred 1.25m acres since 15 August when lightning strikes ignited blazes across the state, according to the latest numbers from Cal Fire. 
The areas affected by fires have now reached the size of Delaware. These “megafires” could burn for weeks, Cal Fire officials warned.

Progress is being made. Evacuation orders for zones of the Walbridge fire, which is part of the LNU Lightning Complex, have been lifted after more of it was contained over the past few days. 
The Walbridge fire is currently 54,503 acres and 17% contained. People are being told they can return to the cities of Healdsburg and Windsor, which were on the outskirts of the blaze.

The combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and wildfires in California have created a uniquely difficult situation, top health official Mark Ghaly said on Tuesday. 
California's top health official, Dr. Mark Ghaly, on wildfires amid the pandemic: ""This is indeed a difficult time in California. We knew something like this would come...but the reality of it is challenging for so many Californians.""
He said 3,383 evacuees are in congregate shelters rather than hotel rooms, meaning that sharing air could lead to more infections. 
Firefighters have also had to modify how they work this year, as they generally stay in camps with close contact between shifts.

In a press conference Tuesday morning, officials from the Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit of Cal Fire (the California department of forestry and fire protection) shared that they have made significant progress in addressing the LNU Lightning Complex in the last 48 hours. 
Officials attributed this progress to better weather and an increase in resources over the last five days. Monday and Tuesday saw calmer winds and cooler temperatures, and clearer air on Monday afternoon allowed aircrafts to carry out firefighting efforts. Planes and helicopters are often grounded when the air is too smoke-filled, the official said. 
Firefighting personnel and supplies have come in from other states to supplement firefighting effort. Cal Fire now has 304 fire engines, 50 water tankers, four helicopters, and 2,194 personnel total, officials said.
As of Tuesday, the LNU Lightning Complex has burnt 352,913 acres and is now 27% contained. More resources from the national guard are expected in coming days. 
Despite the increasing containment, there remain some “problem areas”, officials said, and the fires remain fast-changing. Many evacuations remain in effect and there will likely be more evacuation orders today.
Another official noted that even when these fires are contained, the danger is not over. “We are in the middle of peak fire season,” she said. “Once this fire is done we still have a long way to go.”

Smoke alerts have been issued to several California counties as wildfires continue to affect air quality across the state. 
The California department of public health and the office of Governor Gavin Newsom have urged all Californians to stay indoors when possible, with windows and doors closed. 
Coty Jen, an assistant professor at the Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, told USA Today the concentration of tiny particles (PM2.5) in the Bay Area is roughly five times the daily average limit set by the EPA.
“Even healthy people are reporting headaches, bloody noses, etc, during this current smoke event,” Jen said.
Areas that have been issued smoke warnings include Concord, Livermore, Napa, Oakland, Redwood City, San Francisco, San Jose, San Rafael, Sebastopol, Vacaville, and Vallejo. 
Reporting live from Oakland, California, this reporter can confirm the air is mildly smoky and uncomfortable to breathe. Going outdoors smells like a campfire and aerobic activities like walking or running can feel slightly more difficult. Oakland is experiencing a “moderate” air quality index today. 
By comparison, Vacaville, where fires are located, have an “unhealthy” air quality index.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/25/california-fires-hope-warning-lifted-deadliest-blaze-25-contained,California: firefighters begin to turn tide but warn that 'mega-fire era' has arrived,,"Officials say progress was made against the the LNU Lightning Complex and the CZU Lightning Complex fires
First published on Tue 25 Aug 2020 13.07 BST
Firefighters caught a slight break in efforts to contain the barrage of wildfire that has burned 1.4m acres across California, displacing tens of thousands amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The dry lightning and winds that forecasters warned could stoke the blazes and spark more were less severe than expected, allowing crews – aided by reinforcements from neighboring states – to make progress in containing the fires. The blazes have killed seven and scorched more than 1,200 homes and other buildings.
“This is indeed a difficult time in California,” said Mark Ghaly, California’s top health official. We knew something like this would come,” he added. “But the reality of it is challenging for so many Californians.”
Ghaly advised residents to heed evacuation orders, acknowledging: “We’re telling many folks who haven’t left their homes for months, who are worried about their exposure to Covid, that it’s safer to leave than to stay.” To those out of the fires’ immediate path but residing in one of the larges swaths of the state that remain blanketed in smoke, his message was to remain indoors, as the cloth face coverings that help prevent the spread of coronavirus do not filter out toxic air.
Although fire crews are making progress, many of those displaced by the fires face an uncertain future. “Overall our hope is to get you back quickly,” said Mark Essick, the sheriff of Sonoma county, where the LNU Complex fire, the most deadly of the conflagrations that have overtaken the Bay Area, continues to burn. Officials are still assessing the damage. “This is a time when some people will realize that they do not have homes,” Essick said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Officials said on Tuesday the LNU Complex fire was 27% contained, having scorched more than 350,000 acres in California’s wine country.
Crews were also making some progress against the SCU Complex fire east of the San Francisco Bay, which, having scorched more than 363,000 acres is the second-largest wildfire in California history, followed by the LNU, which is the third-largest. A third major fire, the CZU complex to the south, was also heeling, thanks to calmer weather and some rain over the weekend, according to officials.
“We are essentially living in a mega-fire era,” said Jake Hess, a Cal Fire unit chief, told reporters on Monday. Large, catastrophic fires “have been outpacing themselves every year”, he said.
Officials warned the danger was far from over. Six people who returned to a restricted area south of San Francisco were surprised by fire and had to be rescued, the San Mateo sheriff said. Looters have been warned they will be arrested and some people have been taken into custody, including a man found with $5,000 in his car, authorities said.
Evacuees tempted to check on their homes should think again, officials said.
“It is highly dangerous in there still,” Jonathan Cox, a Cal Fire deputy chief, of the blaze north of Santa Cruz. “We have bridges that have failed, old wooden bridges that have failed that may not appear failed to people, that they may drive on. It is not safe.”
An estimated 170,000 are under evacuation orders and tens of thousands of homes remain under threat. Some orders were reduced to warnings on Monday.
Elinor Slayer fled her home in the redwood-dotted mountain town of Boulder Creek, north of Santa Cruz, on Tuesday evening, along with her four children, when they started seeing burnt leaves and large pieces of ash.
“Luckily for me, I have a 13-year-old daughter who is very cautious about wildfires. We had bags packed already,” said Slayer, 48. “We hadn’t gotten an evacuation order yet but my daughter said, ‘It’s time to go.’”
The family is counting their blessings that everyone is safe and hoping their home is too. “We don’t know what we’re going to return to,” Slayer said.
The fires are blamed for at least seven deaths, among them 70-year-old Mary Hintemeyer, her boyfriend, Leo McDermott, and his son, Tom, said Hintemeyer’s son, Robert McNeal, of Winters, California.
McNeal told KPIX-TV he had lost contact with his mother last Tuesday night as the fires sped up. He said his mother had tried to go into town earlier that day but turned back at a roadblock where authorities said if she went through she wouldn’t be allowed back. She returned to get her boyfriend, who was in a wheelchair.
Authorities found their remains among the ruins on the Napa county property, he said.
“Just get out, don’t wait,” McNeal said. “If you think it’s going to be too much to get your sprinklers on before you get out of there, forget those too. Forget it. Get out. Just get out. It ain’t worth it.”
The huge, simultaneous wildfires advancing across the state, many of which were spawned by a rare bout of dry lightning over the Bay Area, have been feeding off dry vegetation, primed by a historically dry winter and desiccated by a recent heatwave.
Although the California landscape has adapted to survive and even thrive amid wildfires, global heating is fueling more frequent, more extreme blazes, according to Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at the University of California, Merced. The recent spate of fires is unusual because peak fire season in California usually comes in the fall, when powerful offshore winds stoke huge blazes.
As California continues efforts to contain hundreds of wildfires across the state, neighboring Oregon, Montana, Idaho and Colorado are coping with wildfires. Smoke from the west is forecasted to travel across the country.
In and around the Bay Area, in cities and towns worst affected by fire, schools that had already delayed opening due to the coronavirus pandemic have further delayed classes as fires have forced students and teachers to evacuate. In Santa Cruz, officials wrote to families that school would be suspended through the end of the month or later, “because we have more staff displaced and evacuated than we have substitutes”. In nearby Scotts Valley, the local school superintendent wrote to families that the district had to postpone classes and “pivot and adjust to the latest crisis before us”.
“I am sincerely sorry that this is happening and my heart and prayers go out to all of those affected by this situation,” wrote the superintendent Tanya Krause.

Laura strengthens into a hurricane and expected to slam Texas and Louisiana
",,"Major storm heads to US after killing two dozen on the island of Hispaniola, 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic

Hundreds of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate the Gulf coast on Tuesday, as Laura strengthened into a hurricane that forecasters said could slam into Texas and Louisiana as a major storm with ferocious winds and deadly flooding.
Laura passed Cuba after killing nearly two dozen on the island of Hispaniola, 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.
More than 385,000 were told to flee the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and still more were ordered to evacuate low-lying south-western Louisiana, where forecasters said as much as 13ft of storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire communities.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) projected that Laura would become a category 3 hurricane before making landfall late on Wednesday or early on Thursday, with winds of around 115mph capable of inflicting devastating damage.
“The waters are warm enough everywhere there to support a major hurricane, category 3 or even higher. The waters are very warm where the storm is now and will be for the entire path up until the Gulf coast,” the NHC deputy director, Ed Rappaport, said.
Ocean water was expected to push on to land along more than 450 miles of coast from Texas to Mississippi. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and storm surge warnings from the Port Arthur, Texas, flood protection system to the mouth of the Mississippi River.
As of Tuesday morning, Laura was 585 miles south-east of Lake Charles, Louisiana, traveling north-west at 16mph. Its peak winds were 75mph. The NHC nudged its forecast track a bit farther west as computer simulations pushed the storm closer to Texas.
There was little to keep Laura from turbocharging. Nearly all forecasts showed rapid strengthening at some point in the next couple of days.
The deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic reportedly included a 10-year-old girl whose home was hit by a tree and a mother and young son crushed by a wall.
On top of storm surge that could penetrate miles inland, as much as 15in of rain could fall in some parts of Louisiana, said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana, near the bullseye of Laura’s projected path.
Marco, a system that approached land ahead of Laura, weakened into a remnant just off Louisiana’s shore. Satellite images showed a disorganized cluster of clouds, what meteorologists call “a naked swirl”, Jones said.
But Laura powered up. The crew of a hurricane hunter plane confirmed that Laura became a hurricane with top winds of 75mph shortly after passing between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.
The NHC warned people not to focus on the details of the official forecast since storm surge, wind and heavy rain will extend far from Laura’s center.
In Galveston and Port Arthur, mandatory evacuation orders went into effect at 6am. People planning on entering official shelters were told to bring just one bag of personal belongings each, and a mask to reduce the spread of coronavirus.
“If you decide to stay, you’re staying on your own,” Port Arthur’s mayor, Thurman Bartie, said.
Officials in Houston asked residents to prepare supplies in case they lose power for a few days or need to evacuate homes along the coast. Some in the area are still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey three years ago.
Emergencies were declared in Louisiana and Mississippi, and shelters opened with cots set farther apart, among other measures designed to curb coronavirus infections.
Laura’s arrival comes just days before the 29 August anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which breached the levees in New Orleans, flattened much of the Mississippi coast and killed as many as 1,800 in 2005. Hurricane Rita then struck south-west Louisiana that 24 September, as a category 3 storm."

Hurricane Laura: US health workers brace for natural disaster amid pandemic
",,"At least nine local jurisdictions issue evacuation orders as storm barrels towards US Gulf coast

As Hurricane Laura barreled towards the US Gulf coast, healthcare workers in Texas and south-west Louisiana region braced for the potential effects of a natural disaster during the coronavirus pandemic.
Laura became a hurricane on Tuesday as the weather system entered the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico with forecasters projecting it could hit the coast of the US as a category 3 storm with life-threatening winds of up to 115mph.
The hurricane is expected to make landfall late on Wednesday or early Thursday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.
At least nine local jurisdictions have issued mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders, meaning hundreds of thousands of people could be displaced by storm preparation during the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated Texas and Louisiana.
Hospitals throughout the region were moving to discharge as many patients as possible who were well enough to return home and urged hurricane preparedness to prevent a potential surge in patients.
In Houston, the biggest city under threat from Laura, doctors at the largest medical system in the region told local news hospitals were ready for a potential influx as the number of Covid-19 patients continued to decline.
“All of our facilities are ready for floods and high winds so I think we’re in as good shape as we can be when these things come close to the coast,” Dr David Callender, Memorial Hermann System president and CEO, told ABC 8 News.
With reference to the pandemic, Callender added: “We’re in much better shape now than we were then, and that gives us a little more freedom and flexibility in terms of how we respond to storms.”
In Harris county, the jurisdiction that incorporates most of Houston, masks, hand sanitizer and sanitary wipes have been added to the list of essential items residents have been urged to procure in order to ride out the storm. In Port Arthur, a small city north of Houston under a mandatory evacuation order, residents are being told they must bring a mask if they evacuate to one of the city’s hurricane shelters.
Harris county remains a Covid-19 hotpot although the county has seen a decline in positive tests in recent weeks it still lists over 25,000 active cases as of Tuesday morning. At least 200 people have died from the virus a day in Texas for the past three weeks, according to the Texas Tribune.
Forecasters say a storm surge of up to 11ft could inundate certain areas of the coast with warnings that such a rise could lead to substantial inland flooding. There were also concerns of up to 15in of rainwater in certain areas of Louisiana, which could lead to flash flooding.
29 August marks the 15th anniversary of the devastating effects of hurricane Katrina on New Orleans and other coastal cities in the region. A devastating hurricane that led to an official death toll in Louisiana of 1,833.
 Louisiana’s governor, John Bel Edwards, said Laura could cause major damage to certain parts of the state.
.
“Every storm is unique. We’re only going to dodge the bullet so many times,” he told reporters.
The governor said Louisiana would remain in phase two of coronavirus reopening, meaning most businesses will stay at 50% capacity with mandatory mask wearing throughout the state.
On Sunday Louisiana recorded 1,223 new coronavirus cases over a two-day period, with a decline in hospitalizations."

‘Next fire season is already upon us’: NSW to adopt all recommendations of bushfire inquiry report
",,"Report finds climate change ‘clearly played a role’ in conditions that led up to Australia’s 2019-2020 fires, which were so extreme, traditional firefighting methods often failed

Last summer’s bushfire disaster was so unusual that traditional firefighting methods, such as hazard reduction burning, failed in some instances, an inquiry into the crisis heard.
The final report of the New South Wales bushfire inquiry, published on Tuesday, said the 2019-20 bushfire season brought fires in forested regions on a scale not seen in recorded history in Australia.
“The season showed us what damage megafires can do, and how dangerous they can be for our communities and firefighters,” the inquiry chairs, former NSW police deputy commissioner Dave Owens and former NSW chief scientist Mary O’Kane, said in their opening summary.’
“And it is clear that we should expect fire seasons like 2019-20 or potentially worse to happen again.”
The NSW government said on Tuesday it would be adopting all of the report’s 76 recommendations, which include the establishment of a major new centre for bushfire research and technology, new training to increase the capacity of fire authorities to deal with disasters of the scale seen in 2019-20, and examination of existing preparedness strategies to determine the best approach to increasingly frequent, extreme fire seasons.
The inquiry found climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions “clearly played a role in the conditions that led up to the fires and in the unrelenting conditions that supported the fires to spread” but climate change alone “does not explain everything that happened”.
“The 2019-20 bush fire season challenged conventional assumptions. For example, it appears that the extreme dryness of forested regions over large continuous areas was the determining factor in the size of the fires,” it read. 
The report said that extreme conditions of the kind seen last summer are likely to happen again and dangerous fires will become more frequent, meaning state and local authorities would need to do more to prepare.
Former fire chiefs who have called for an urgent response from governments to the climate crisis said the findings of the review supported their position.
During the fire season, former fire chiefs from several states said their advice to the Morrison government that the climate crisis was making fire seasons worse had been ignored.
“The NSW bushfire inquiry has echoed what the experts have said all along: climate change is driving longer, hotter and more dangerous bushfire seasons, including our Black Summer,” said Greg Mullins, a former fire and NSW rescue commissioner.
Mullins said Australia was in a new era of climate-driven bushfires in which fires were more likely to develop dangerous pyroconvection events. He said governments needed to do more to address the underlying cause.
“Immediate steps the NSW state government can take to drive down emissions include: rejecting all new coal and gas projects like Santos’ Narrabri project, and accelerating its net-zero plan to create clean, long-term jobs in sectors like renewable energy,” he said.
The report said the scale of the disaster meant fire services were stretched in their capacity to respond, even with interstate and international support. Authorities could not get to all fires fast enough and fires started by lightning in remote areas made suppression difficult.
The inquiry found the total tally of fire-generated thunderstorms in south-eastern Australia since the early 1980s until 2018-19 was 60. That number jumped to 90 by the end of the last summer, an increase of 50% in a single fire season.
Taken together with dangerous weather conditions, the fires had become extreme, rendering some traditional fire-fighting methods ineffective.
“Previous prescribed burning and hazard reduction activity appears to have reduced fire spread in some instances, but in others it appears to have had no effect on the severity of the fires,” the report said.
It also found that the 2019-20 season could have been even worse if conditions had combined to affect more population centres or if the drought had not caused a decline in grass fuel loads.
 In the face of such megafires, governments, authorities and communities needed to know more about fire suppression methods and how effective they were, the report added.
The authors also recommended immediate improvements to communications in fire-prone communities, safety equipment and systems for firefighters, increased aerial firefighting at night and a reexamination of traditional firefighting techniques, including backburning.
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Tuesday the scars left by the fires season would be long-lasting.
“We’re not going to pretend that we have managed firstly to deal with all the physical issues and secondly, of course, the ongoing trauma of those directly impacted and, of course, those who have lost loved ones,” she said.
“That is why the government is there to continue to support those communities but I also appreciate very much that there is a sense of urgency and the next fire season is already upon us.”
She said the government had taken every action it could to respond to the recommendations and the emergency services minister, David Elliott, would be tasked with coordinating the government’s response and any measures that could be expedited.
“We have to accept also our climate is changing and those who wrote the report acknowledge that,” she said.
“Coupled with the drought, coupled with fuel loads in some areas but, moreover, the climate is changing.
“We have to expect and accept that part of the ferocity we saw was a combination of all those things and our government is working as hard as we can, as fast as we can and as efficiently as we can to resource up our agencies but also to do everything we can to mitigate the risks.”"

This “historic” spate of California wildfires have so far displaced hundreds of thousands during a pandemic, killed seven, destroyed at least tens of thousands of structures, burned through the equivalent acreage of a small state and sent plumes of smoke over several regions, forcing millions indoors during a heat wave. 
Yet the country’s paper of record – the New York Times – seems unwilling to feature this incredibly newsworthy disaster that has affected millions of Americans prominently on its pages. 
California's record-setting wildfires have displaced 120k and are spreading uncontrolled. There's more lightning on the way.

Californians have long felt overlooked and almost deliberately misunderstood by East Coast media – just look to Los Angeles Twitter any time the New York Times writes anything about the city. Last year, Curbed LA came up with a bingo card after a New York Times published a piece about Echo Park that included cliches like “Joan Didion quote”, “yoga/juice/kale” and “casual racism”.
But when the Washington Post dedicates its lead, above-the-fold front page image to the wildfires and the New York Times chooses to run an image of a water park party in Wuhan, China? Well, that’s a choice, to say the least.

The largest wildfires that firefighters are battling in California at this moment are called lightning complex fires. Cal Fire has referred to the past week as the August Lightning Siege. 
Timelapse footage captured a severe tropical storm that battered parts of northern California, as lightning illuminated the sky over Pacifica and officials issued a red flag fire warning. https://t.co/99IKWmmAyG pic.twitter.com/WGm8LZ9dxj
The cause of the CZU Lightning Complex Fire and the Butte/Tehama/Glenn Lightning Complex Fire have officially been listed as lightning. The two largest fires currently burning though - the LNU Lightning Complex Fire and the SCU Lightning Complex Fire - are still listed as under investigation. 
That doesn’t mean they were misnamed or that fire officials have exaggerated the August Lightning Siege - it means Cal Fire is busy and that figuring out the point or points of origin for these particular complex fires is probably complicated. 
What it comes down to is that lightning has been determined to be the cause of five out of seven of the national forest or park fires currently burning: the August Complex in Mendocino National Forest, the Loyalton Fire in Tahoe National Forest, the Castle Fire in Sequoia National Park, the North Complex Fire in Plumas National Forest and the Beach Fire in Inyo National Forest.  
In total, those fires have burned 275,439 acres, or 430 square miles - just a hair under the size of New York City.

As evacuees fled their homes, carrying just what they could pack into their cars, some were forced to roll out their sleeping bags and set up for the night in a community park.
Photographer Rachel Bujalski captured a devastating snapshot of the choices that some evacuees faced while escaping the LNU Lightning Complex fire. 
“We didn’t want to end up in a crowded place and didn’t want to go too far from where we live,” said one Sonoma county resident.

Tens of thousands around California have had to evacuate since the lightning fires began last week. Some have been able to return to their homes, but others are not so fortunate. 
Which raises the question: how do you set up emergency evacuation shelters in the time of social distancing and Covid-19?

Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, addressed the issue during his briefing, discussing some of the measures the state has taken. 
For evacuees unable to find alternative forms of shelter with friends and family, the state has housed 1,480 people in 599 rooms across 31 hotels. 
In addition to those efforts, there are 17 congregate shelters operating in seven counties that have housed 731 people. 
Newsom described touring some of these congregate shelters in the past week to observe the health and safety protocols that they were undertaking. Before he could even enter to tour, he had to undergo a temperature check and a health screening, and then a nurse provided him with shelter guidelines for social distancing. Shelter occupants have to wear face masks, he said, and air purifiers were running at all times.
The cots were spaced “in excess of 10 feet apart”, said Newsom, and shelter officials had taped out paths and spacing for bathroom use. 
“Nothing is perfect. Everybody is human trying to do their absolute best,” Newsom said. “But what I saw, I was very impressed and very gratified of the seriousness to which people were taking this effort.”

Two of the lightning complex wildfires burning around the San Francisco Bay Area have grown to the size of the second- and third- largest in California history. 
The LNU Lightning Complex Fire, burning in Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Yolo and Lake counties, has now grown to 350,000 acres and 22% containment, according to the governor. 
The SCU Lightning Complex Fire, burning in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties, is now 347,000 acres and 10% containment.

The governor used the term “historic” to describe the wildfires.
Here’s some context, with more up-to-date numbers. This time last year, California had 4,292 wildfires burning across 56,000 acres. 
This year, the state has 7,002 fires burning across more than 1.4 million acres. 
So far, seven people have been killed in these wildfires and an estimated 12,000 structures destroyed - Governor Newsom noted that the number of structures destroyed is only what has been reported to the state and that the actual number is most likely more.

Northern California health officials are telling residents to stay inside, to protect themselves from the poor air quality caused by the wildfire smoke. But for many, that’s not an option. 
A vulnerable, essential labor force – the more than 381,000 agriculture workers in California – already disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic keeps working as others flee and take shelter. 
The smoke is thick where farm workers were laboring harvesting strawberries in the Salinas area. Thank you @PocketNihilist for sending us this video documenting the hard work in difficult conditions farm workers do so we can have food on our tables. #WeFeedYou pic.twitter.com/O6r0sVcQOO
These low-wage, primarily Latinx laborers do not have the option of paid time off, hazard pay or sick days - for them, keeping America fed means keeping their families fed. On days of heavy smoke, they’re forced to choose between their health and their paycheck. 
Workers rights advocates told me that state regulations require companies to provide workers with face masks when the air quality reaches the unhealthiest level. But with the various levels of contractors and subcontractors within the industry – a company may have a different company in charge of hiring the fieldworkers and another company in charge of overseeing the fieldworkers – what’s on paper as a company mandate does not always end up in practice in the fields.
And unfortunately, according to advocates, the state and federal occupational safety and health agencies meant to hold these companies accountable only respond when complaints are filed when “any person can just drive through the fields and see if there are workers not being protected or given safety precautions”, said Lucas Zucker, the policy and communications director for the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy. 
“The structure of these worker safety agencies are not set up to respond quickly in a disaster,” he said.

Firefighters in California saw some reprieve on Monday after dodging a major lightning storm in the San Francisco Bay Area, as the state continues to battle blazes the governor described as “historic”. Two of the three largest wildfires ever recorded in California have scorched through more than 1m acres, displaced more than 100,000 people, and killed seven.
Officials are cautiously optimistic but pleaded with residents to stay out of evacuation zones and prepare for days away from home, as the massive fires near the Bay Area spread smoky air.
Dry lightning storms forecasted for the weekend spared the area. A highly unusual spate of dry lightning over the region had sparked the conflagrations that have stretched the state’s firefighting crews, and officials feared that the fresh round of storms on Sunday and Monday would stoke and feed the flames.
“The weather hasn’t been as significant as we were expecting, which is good,” Mark Brunton, operations chief for California’s fire agency, Cal Fire, said at a briefing about the CZU fire Monday morning. But, he added, “conditions are still ripe out there. Complacency kills.”
At the CZU Lightning Complex, a huge grouping of fires in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, south of the San Francisco Bay, authorities announced they had discovered the body of a 70-year-old man in a remote area called Last Chance. The man had been reported missing and police used a helicopter to reach him, among 40 off-the-grid homes at the end of a windy, steep dirt road.
The area was under an evacuation order and Chris Clark, the Santa Cruz sheriff’s chief deputy, said it was a stark reminder of the need for residents to leave the area.
“This is one of the darkest periods we’ve been in with this fire,” he said.
The fatality was the seventh in California since a record 12,000 lightning strikes set off 650 wildfires across the state. About 14,000 firefighters, 2,400 engines and 95 aircraft are battling the blazes across California, the largest of which include the CZU Complex; the LNU Lightning Complex, burning north of the bay through wine country; and the SCU Lightning Complex to the east. The latter two are the second and third largest California fires on record, each burning through more than 500 square miles.
Dry lightning overnight, which threatened to derail efforts to contain the fires, struck the Central Valley and western Sierra Nevada foothills but spared the Bay Area. The National Weather Service canceled its red flag warning for the Bay Area, though the potential for dry thunderstorms remains in northern California.
“Foundationally and fundamentally, we are deploying every resource,” Gavin Newsom, the state’s governor, said at a press conference on Monday. “We continue to battle historic wildfires, but we’re also battling this historic pandemic.”
The pandemic, which has killed more than 12,100 in the state and infected more than 668,300, has complicated the state’s response efforts. Those evacuated from their homes have had to weigh the risks of staying with friends and family or at evacuation centers, where they might be vulnerable to catching or spreading Covid-19. At evacuation centers, officials have set up tents for families so they can properly distance from one another and shelters are trying to get “as many air purifiers as we can”, Newsom said. Authorities have also secured hotel rooms for 1,500 evacuees.
Smoke and air pollution from the fires leave those with respiratory illnesses, who are at risk for severe complications from Covid-19, doubly vulnerable. Health officials have asked residents to remain indoors whenever possible to avoid breathing unhealthy air.
The unrelenting blazes have stretched the state’s public health resources and its large firefighting crews.
The LNU fire has been the most deadly and destructive, accounting for five deaths and 845 destroyed homes and other buildings. 
Brunton, the Cal Fire official, said crews had been working exhausting, 72-hour shifts and resources were stretched. “This is a big monster” that crews are facing, he said.
Officials surveying maps at command centers were astonished by the sheer size of the fires, Brice Bennett, a Cal Fire spokesman, said. “You could overlay half of one of these fires and it covers the entire city of San Francisco,” he said.
Authorities said their firefighting efforts in Santa Cruz were hindered by people who refused to evacuate and those using the chaos to steal. The Santa Cruz county sheriff, Jim Hart, said 100 officers were patrolling and anyone not authorized to be in an evacuation zone would be arrested.
Among the theft victims was a fire commander who was robbed when he left his vehicle.
Holly Hansen, who fled the LNU fire, was among evacuees from the community of Angwin allowed to go back to their homes for one hour to retrieve belongings. She and her three dogs waited five hours in her SUV for their turn. Among the items she took with her were photos of her pets.
“It’s horrible. I lived in Sonoma during the [2017] Tubbs Fire, so this is time No 2 for me. It’s horrible when you have to think about what to take,” she said. “I think it’s a very raw human base emotion to have fear of fire and losing everything. It’s frightening.”
The blazes have come before the traditional peak fire season in the autumn, when powerful offshore winds stoke and spread flames. Those fire-fueling winds are still expected in the coming weeks, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. But the unusual thunderstorms that followed a scorching heatwave, combined with a historically dry winter, provided both the spark and the kindling for the eruption of fire that has overtaken California in August.
The 1.2m acres that have burned in the past 10 days have far overtaken the estimated 259,800 acres that burned throughout all of 2019. In 2018, which saw one of “ the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California”, according to Cal Fire, 1.9m acres burned.
Although wildfire is a natural and necessary part of the ecosystem in California, the climate crisis is fueling more extreme, destructive blazes, Swain said."

First published on Mon 24 Aug 2020 13.02 BST
As two powerful storms menaced the US Gulf Coast on Monday, forecasters feared Marco would drive sea water to shore and unleash torrential rains just two days before Laura lashes the same region with potentially more powerful storm surge and winds.
Laura caused the deaths of at least 11 in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, knocking out power and causing flooding in the two nations that share the island of Hispaniola.
Forecasters raised the ominous possibility that warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico could super-charge Laura into a powerful hurricane. Laura’s center was just off Cuba and was not expected to weaken over land.
“Laura will be moving over the very warm and deep waters of Gulf Stream and Loop Current located over the south-eastern Gulf, which could trigger a brief period of rapid intensification,” the National Hurricane Center said.
That is a recipe for damaging winds of more than 110mph as Laura approaches the US, forecasters said.
“There is definitely a possibility that it could be a little bit stronger and be a category 3,” said meteorologist Benjamin Schott, who runs the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana.
Marco had grown into a hurricane early on Sunday but then weakened. On Monday it was centered about 85 miles south-south-east of the mouth of the Mississippi river and heading north-west at 10mph. Forecasters expected it to remain just offshore on Tuesday as it weakened and dissipated, leaving a flooded coastline as a stage for Laura.
Laura was centered just south of central Cuba, drenching most of the island with rain and tropical storm force winds. It’s top sustained winds were 65mph.
Rain bands from both storms could bring 2ft of rain to parts of Louisiana and several feet of potentially deadly storm surge, forecasters said.
“Basically that would be 10ft plus along the south-west Louisiana coast line” in a reasonable worst-case scenario, Schott said. That surge also could push water up to 30 miles up the rivers, he said.
The two-storm combination could bring a history-making onslaught of life-threatening winds and flooding from Texas to Alabama, forecasters said. It also comes as Louisiana continues its struggle to curb coronavirus infections.
Emergencies were declared in Louisiana and Mississippi.
“The virus is not concerned that we have hurricanes coming, and so it’s not going to take any time off and neither can we,” Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards said. “And it’s going to make things a little more difficult, but we have to be mindful of these mitigation measures.”
August Creppel, chief of the United Houma Nation, was concerned about the group’s 17,000 members, spread out over six parishes along the Louisiana coast.
“I’m very concerned for my people,” he said. “We know our people are going to get hit. We just don’t know who yet.”
Creppel has been in contact with the Red Cross in order to get supplies brought in to those in need once the storms pass, and the nation’s office in Houma, Louisiana has been fielding calls from people with questions or needing help.
The double punch of two storms comes just days before the 29 August anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Creppel took part in a ceremony on Saturday at the Superdome in New Orleans that included Native American singing and prayers.
Sarah Manowitz, responsible for four bars in the city’s French Quarter, saw to it that windows had been boarded up, battened down her own house and filled her tub with water. She was remaining on site, counting on a “community of people” that looks out for each other during storms.
“We’re all going to help each other share food, share whatever supplies,” she said.
In Haiti, civil protection officials working in the aftermath of Laura said they received reports a 10-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on a home in the southern coastal town of Anse-a-Pitres, on the border with the Dominican Republic.
Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.
Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries."

California wildfires: more storms feared as huge blazes burn on

Firefighters in California prepared on Sunday for high winds and thunderstorms that threatened to spark new blazes and further spread existing fires, as officials warned capacity was stretched to levels “not seen in recent history”.
Progress was made against three massive and destructive wildfires during a calm stretch overnight on Saturday. However the The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a “red flag” warning through Monday afternoon for the drought-stricken area, meaning extreme fire conditions including high temperatures, low humidity and wind gusts up to 65mph could result in “dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior”.
The “complexes”, or groups of fires, were burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area, and have destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and structures and forced tens of thousands to evacuate. Ignited by nearly 12,000 lightning strikes across the state in the past week, the fires have claimed six lives so far and have burned significantly more acres than all of the fire damage in 2019. Officials are now seeking assistance from states across the US, as well as Canada and Australia.
Shana Jones, chief for Cal Fire’s Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit, said the state’s resources were “stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history”, and noted at a Sunday news conference that even with an influx of support, there were still huge challenges: “We are definitely far from getting these fires handled. We are not out of the woods by far.”
With the red flag warning in place, she urged residents to be prepared to evacuate at any moment, and advised them to consider evacuating if they are concerned, even if orders aren’t in place: “Be ready to leave in the dead of night if it comes to that. If your sixth sense just says I need to leave, then please do so. Do not wait to be told to leave.”
At a morning briefing on the so-called CZU Lightning Complex fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco, officials said they had increased containment to 8% and with the better weather on Saturday dug more protective lines around vulnerable communities, including the University of California, Santa Cruz.
But there is concern about the weather and the thunderstorms that will bring high winds and “dry” lightning, a term used when such storms have little or no rain.
Chief Mark Brunton of Cal Fire said the winds can blow a fire in any direction and while firefighters did the most they could with the time they had to prepare, he was not sure what to expect.
“There’s a lot of potential for things to really go crazy out there,” he said.
Firefighters and law enforcement have also struggled with people who refuse to leave evacuation zones. Santa Cruz sheriff’s department chief deputy Chris Clark said when people don’t heed evacuation orders it is inherently dangerous for civilians, with fires burning unpredictably and tree branches falling. One hit a patrol car and damaged the windshield.
“Please, please, please leave the evacuation area,” he said.
Since 15 August, state fire officials said, more than 500 fires of varying sizes have burned throughout California, scorching a million acres, or 1,562sq miles. Of those, about two dozen major fires are attracting much of the state’s resources.
Other casualties included ancient redwood trees at California’s oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, plus the park’s headquarters and campgrounds. Smoke from the fires made air quality dangerous, forcing millions to stay inside and creating significant new public health challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“Tuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,” said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville. “By Wednesday night, I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.”
The fire that burned Hanson’s home is the LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country north of San Francisco. It has been the most destructive, accounting for all the deaths and 845 destroyed buildings. It and a fire south-east of the Bay Area are among the five largest fires in state history, with both burning more than 500sq miles.
Donald Trump on Saturday issued a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Governor Gavin Newsom said the declaration will help people with crisis counseling, housing and other social services.
Fire officials have struggled to get enough resources to fight the biggest fires. The wine country fire has only 1,700 firefighters on scene. By comparison, the state had 5,000 firefighters assigned to the Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018, the largest fire in state history.
Underscoring the danger for firefighters, the Sonoma county sheriff’s office released dramatic video of the helicopter rescue on Friday night of two firefighters trapped on a ridge line at Point Reyes National Seashore.
“Had it not been for that helicopter, those firefighters would certainly have perished,” said Sonoma county sheriff Mark Essick.
The air pollution, which has spread as far as the Great Plains in the central US, is especially dangerous for people with respiratory conditions, who already face a higher risk of Covid-19 complications, while growing evidence also suggests that pollution might aggravate the spread of the virus. Restaurants and other businesses that have moved their operations outdoors to comply with coronavirus regulations are now struggling with the extremely poor air quality.
Further complicating the disaster response is the fact that California has long relied on incarcerated laborers to fight wildfires, but the Covid lockdowns inside prisons forced a dozen of the firefighting crews to shut down earlier this summer. Some imprisoned firefighters have been released early due to Covid and jail overcrowding, which has also contributed to ongoing firefighter shortages.
More than 1,300 incarcerated firefighters, who are typically paid between $2 and $5 a day, were dispatched to fight the blazes this week across the state.
Fire season typically peaks in the autumn when offshore winds spread embers into infernos, but these fires have grown at such a rapid pace, they’ve created their own winds, experts said. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told the Guardian it was “unsettling” that the state had not even hit its peak wildfire season yet. “Right now, there’s no real end in sight.”
Swain said it was difficult to comprehend the “astonishing” scope of the rapid damage, noting that in just two weeks, more than 1m acres have burned, compared to less than 250,000 acres burning in all of California last year.
“You could overlay half of one of these fires and it covers the entire city of San Francisco,” Cal Fire spokesman Brice Bennetts said on Sunday, adding that an estimated 240,000 people were under evacuation orders and warnings.
The climate crisis has worsened the wildfire challenges in recent years, with fires burning through more acreage and for longer stretches of time.

First published on Sat 22 Aug 2020 11.00 BST
The strawberries that Juan Reyes hand-picked had turned gray from the ash falling from the sky, yet nobody provided him and his fellow farmworkers with any protective face coverings until the next day.
As hundreds of fires burn across California, blanketing swaths of the state in smoke so thick that it muted the sun, low-wage farmworkers continued to toil in the fields, working through grueling conditions, now made even worse by the air quality.
“My throat was hurting,” Reyes, 38, said in Spanish. “There’s difficulty breathing. When I got home, my chest was hurting a lot.”
A vulnerable, essential labor force already disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic kept working as others fled and took shelter. More than 381,000 people across California work in the frontline essential agriculture industry, according to the Community and Labor Center at the University of California, Merced, from the lush almond tree orchards in the north to the cornfields of the Central Valley.
Farmworkers already worked in conditions that were ripe for abuse and exploitation, worker rights organizations say. And with larger and more destructive wildfires arriving with each coming year in California, advocates have found it even more difficult to protect their rights.
Farm workers don't get to use Zoom to harvest our food. Ramiro sent us this photo from Salinas CA where he is currently harvesting lettuce during the wildfires, despite the air quality being ""very unhealthy ."" #WeFeedYou pic.twitter.com/VRmXexmxUa
“Whether it’s wildfire, pandemic, drought or storm, farmworkers are out in the field,” said Lucas Zucker, the policy and communications director for the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy. “It’s a largely immigrant workforce, many undocumented. Many are from indigenous communities from southern Mexico who face even greater barriers to accessing services and reporting labor abuses.”
Farmworkers in California are “particularly vulnerable”, he continued, because of the nature of the crops and the industry. “It’s extremely labor-intensive crops that require a lot of people out in the fields picking by hand. You’ll see thousands of workers out there picking strawberries, as opposed to Iowa, where there are cornfields where it’s mostly automated.”
In Santa Cruz county, where Reyes picks strawberries, more than 20,000 people have been ordered to evacuate as the CZU August Lightning Complex fire grew to 40,000 acres.
To his south lies Steinbeck country, the lush agricultural valley of the Central Coast that was the setting for the Grapes of Wrath. Here, the Carmel fire burns at 4,285 acres and 0% containment and the River fire at 33,653 acres and 7% containment. Farther south on the coast, about 10 miles from Big Sur, the Dolan fire grew to 6,700 acres.
Together, these fires formed a heavy cloud of smoke that hung overhead as these workers picked their crops. State regulations require companies to provide workers with masks when the air quality reaches a certain threshold of very bad, Zucker said, but that doesn’t always happen. The agriculture industry in general is very segmented, with layers of contracting and subcontracting. Safety protocols established by a company, Zucker explained, may not reach the ones tasked with hiring and overseeing the fieldworkers.
“Because of who most farmworkers are, because of the culture that has developed in agriculture, there are a lot of workers who don’t receive the safety conditions that are on paper,” he said. “There is also often a culture where if you speak up or say you don’t want to work, you may be seen as someone who is lazy or doesn’t want to work and you may not be called back for the next harvest.”
Compounding this year’s smoke exposure is a virus that affects the lungs.
“Even before Covid-19, we saw a huge problem with the lack of N95 masks for farmworkers during wildfires,” Zucker said. “Now it’s gotten even worse because it’s much more difficult to get N95 masks because a lot of them have gone to hospitals in the past few months.”
Reyes, who asked not to name the company he worked for out of fear that he would lose his job, said he and his fellow workers did not get masks for the first day the smoke was heavy over Santa Cruz county. He worked a 10-hour shift that day with no protection.
The next day, he brought his own surgical mask and found that the company had provided his coworkers with the same mask – even though for smoke inhalation, the only mask that truly provides any sort of protection is an N95.
Some of his coworkers opted not to wear the mask because it was so hot out, Reyes said. That’s another issue, Zucker said, workplaces need to provide safety education on top of protective gear so that workers can understand why they need to wear their protective gear. “There are a lot of things people don’t know about the long term exposure to wildfire smoke that you as a worker would think, ‘Hey I’m exposed every day to dust and pesticides and I’m tough and can push through’,” he said.
Paid time off and sick days are not an option in this line of work. On wildfire days, Reyes knows he has the option to put his health first and not go to work that day, to not earn his $5.50 an hour and $1.60 per box filled. But in a state with as high a cost of living as California has, every shift counts. “Who is going to pay the bills?” he asked.
“People often want to say thank you to the farmworkers for feeding us and certainly we should all be grateful for the huge sacrifice that workers are marking,” Zucker said. “But people are pushed to make an impossible choice during something like a pandemic or a wildfire.”
This article was updated on 23 August 2020 to correct the number of frontline workers in California’s agriculture industry."

Residents in low-lying coastal areas of Louisiana and Cuba were evacuating on Sunday, while roads turned to rivers in Haiti’s capital city, as twin hurricanes threatened the Caribbean and US Gulf Coast.
Marco, which strengthened to a hurricane and is forecast to hit Louisiana on Monday, will be followed by Tropical Storm Laura, which was over the Dominican Republic on Sunday and is expected to travel across Hispaniola and Cuba and strengthen to a hurricane before striking the US on Thursday.
At least three people died, including a mother and her seven-year-old son, in the Dominican Republic due to collapsing walls. Laura left more than a million in the country without electricity, forced more than a thousand to evacuate and caused several homes along the Isabela river to collapse, authorities said.
Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards warned residents tropical storm-force winds would arrive by Monday morning and they should be ready to ride out both Marco and Laura.
“Wherever you are at dark tonight is where you need to be prepared to ride out these storms,” he said.
In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, videos on social media showed people wading waist-deep in muddy water in some of the worst flooding seen in years. Haiti is especially vulnerable to intense rains due to poor infrastructure and deforestation which increases the likelihood of landslides.
Authorities called on residents along the Artibonite river to evacuate, as the Peligre Hydroelectric Dam might fail.
Haiti was the first to report a death from Laura: a 10-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on her home in the southern town of Anse-a-Pitres.
With hopes dashed that the mountains of Hispaniola would weaken the storm, Cuba scrambled to prepare. Evacuations were under way in eastern parts of the island, where the storm was expected to strike on Sunday evening, bringing flooding.
Back-to-back hurricanes arriving at the US coast within days “could result in a prolonged period of hazardous weather”, National Hurricane Center forecaster Stacy Stewart warned.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent teams to emergency operations centers in state capitals in Louisiana and Texas, said spokesman Earl Armstrong. Fema is prepared to handle back-to-back storms, he said, pointing to 2004 when four hurricanes hit Florida in six weeks.
Officials in Louisiana’s coastal Lafourche Parish ordered a mandatory evacuation for low-lying areas at noon on Sunday. The US coast guard also raised its warning for the Port of New Orleans, calling for ships to make plans to evacuate some areas.
The potential for flooding and evacuations added to worries about the spread of Covid-19. Tulane University, the largest private employer in New Orleans, said it would close its testing center on Monday due to potential flooding and power outages and called on students to maintain social distancing guidelines.
In Grand Isle, at the state’s southern tip, authorities were placing sandbags to bolster its protective levy while energy companies continued to pull workers from offshore platforms and shut production in Gulf of Mexico wells.
Laura could strengthen and become a category 2 or 3 hurricane and move west, closer to the Houston-Galveston area, bringing flooding rains late on Wednesday or Thursday, said Chris Kerr, a meteorologist and director of offshore forecasting for DTN, an energy, agriculture and weather data provider."

California wildfires: Trump declares major disaster as state braces for worsening conditions

Donald Trump has issued a major disaster declaration as deteriorating weather conditions threaten to spark new wildfires in California, where firefighters have been battling some of the largest wildfires on record for the past week.
Trump’s declaration will release federal assistance for the state, with governor Gavin Newsom saying it will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counselling, housing and other social services.
California is bracing for dry lightning and gusty winds that threaten to start more fires, and stoke the existing blazes. The state has already requested help from Australia and Canada to contain the fires , which have displaced more than 100,000 people and killed six and incinerated hundreds of homes.
The blazes were sparked by an unusual barrage of lightning and stoked by a searing, persistent heatwave last week. Although cooler, more humid weather overnight helped firefighters make ground, “we are not out of the woods,” said Cal fire unit chief Shana Jones on Saturday. “Upcoming predicted weather is not in our favor.”
Newsom said the fires, which have chewed through more than 991,000 acres over seven days, “are stretching our resources, our personnel”, requiring help from other states and countries.
Two fires, the LNU Lightning Complex and the SCU Lightning Complex, now rank as the second and third-largest on record.
“We simply haven’t seen anything like this in many, many years,” said Newsom, who has requested assistance from what he called “the world’s best wildfire-fighters” in Australia, a country that itself experienced enormous wildfires earlier this year.
Help from Canada and 10 other US states is also heading to California. 
Some 560 wildfires were burning throughout the state on Saturday. Many were small and remote but the bulk of the damage was from three clusters ravaging forest and rural areas in the wine country and San Francisco Bay Area.
Those complexes, consisting of dozens of fires, exploded in size on Friday. 
The LNU Lightning Complex, a cluster of fires in the north of the state, had engulfed 314,207 acres across Napa, Lake, Solano and Sonoma counties, placing it behind only the Mendocino Complex fire of 2018, which scorched about 459,000 acres, in the state’s fire records dating back to 1932. The SCU Lightning Complex, another cluster encompassing parts of several Bay Area counties, is the state’s third-largest recorded, having spread across more than 291,900 acres.
“What’s remarkable is that these fires are very explosive and they’re growing so quickly,” Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced, told the Guardian. Fires across the state are “becoming more frequent and more extreme with climate change”, she noted.
Forecasters have warned that things could get even dicier, issuing a red flag warning for Sundaymorning through Monday night. The National Weather Service warned of the potential for dry thunderstorms, noting that “lightning and gusty, erratic winds around storms will be the main threat”. The storms could not only start new fires, but also stoke the flames already burning through the state.
More than 12,000 personnel were fighting fires around the state, aided by helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. By Friday, the state’s fire agency, Cal Fire, had called out 96% of available fire engines.
Among those beating back the flames are more than 1,300 incarcerated firefighters who have been entrusted with the backbreaking work of clearing the fire-fueling vegetation in exchange for low wages and reduced sentences. Their ranks have been diminished by devastating Covid-19 outbreaks in California prisons.
“Their labor has been exploited for decades,” Romarilyn Ralston, who leads Project Rebound, a California State University program that supports formerly incarcerated students, recently told the Guardian. “People are injured, sometimes not fully prepared for fighting a wildland fire.”
This week, the number of large fires was “staggering” and had put “tremendous strain” on resources not just in California, but throughout western states, said Sean Kavanaugh, Cal Fire incident commander. Nevada and Arizona, for example, battled sizable blazes this week as a heatwave swept the west.
In the Santa Cruz mountains south of San Francisco, about 1,000 firefighters were battling a fire 10 times the size they typically would cover, said Dan Olsen, a Cal Fire spokesman.
 
Officials noted that the LNU fires were the state’s biggest priority, but whereas about 5,000 firefighters were deployed to the Mendocino complex fire in 2018, only 1,400 were available to battle the largest of the blazes currently burning California.
Three bodies were found on Thursday in a burned home in Napa county, said Henry Wofford, a sheriff’s spokesman.
A man died in neighboring Solano county, and a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker was found dead in a vehicle in the Vacaville area. Also on Wednesday, a helicopter pilot died in a crash while dropping water on a blaze in Fresno county.
Smoke and ash billowing from the fires has fouled the air throughout the San Francisco Bay area and along California’s scenic central coast. Health officials, who have been advising residents that outdoor spaces are safer than indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic, said this week to stay inside.
Officials warned that air pollution, which has billowed all the way over to the Great Plains in the middle of the country, will render those with respiratory conditions, who face an elevated risk of complications from Covid-19, doubly vulnerable. Growing evidence also suggests that pollution might aggravate the spread of the virus, or worsen its toll.
The fires have also strained the state’s public health resources, already stretched by the struggle to contain a recent surge in coronavirus cases. And those who have been forced to flee their homes have had to weigh the risks of staying with friends and family, or at evacuation centers – where they risk exposure to the virus.

Amid fire and pestilence, floods and storms, the personal is political: Trump must go
",,"Americans face existential challenges. The president has done nothing to help and much to make things worse

My wife and I have been warned we may need to evacuate our cabin in the hills north of San Francisco, because of fires ravaging the Bay Area.
Climate change is largely to blame for these fires, which are growing in number and intensity every year. It’s also to blame for the increasing number and virulence of hurricanes hitting the Gulf and south-east, flash floods along the eastern seaboard, and fierce winds across middle America.
Two tropical storms are developing in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf has never before had two hurricanes at the same time. Both are moving toward Louisiana.
In early August, Illinois and Iowa were hit with winds of up to 110mph. Homes were leveled. At least 10 million acres of crops were destroyed. Many are still without power.
Trump isn’t singularly responsible for climate change, of course. But he’s done nothing to stop it. In fact, he’s done everything he can to accelerate it.
This coming week, he’ll be nominated for a second term. I doubt he or anyone else at the Republican convention will mention his abandonment of the Paris agreement, his rollback of environmental regulations or his boundless generosity to the fossil fuel industry.
Yet I’ll be thinking about all this, and in a newly personal way. So will many others, including, I suspect, some who voted for Trump last time, who reside in the Gulf states, the eastern seaboard and the Midwest.
It’s one thing to understand climate change in the abstract. It’s another to live inside it.
I recently got an email from a woman living in North Carolina whose house was destroyed in a flash flood. She describes herself as a lifelong Republican who’s now a “born-again environmentalist”. She said she’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
It’s much the same with the coronavirus. The gross numbers tell a horrible story. Last Thursday alone, the virus killed 1,090 Americans. Only five died from the virus in Canada the same day, six in the UK, 12 in France, 16 in Japan, 16 in Spain and 10 in Germany.
Yet not even these numbers hit home the way it does when you know someone who has perished or nearly perished from this disease. I know two who have died. A good friend came close. Like me, a growing number of Americans are experiencing the coronavirus personally.
Trump isn’t solely responsible. America’s public health system was never up to the task of dealing with a pandemic. But Trump’s stream of lies, denials and refusals to take responsibility have allowed the disease to ravage America.
If he mentions the pandemic at all during the Republican convention, he’ll probably blame China and claim the official numbers are exaggerated. Many of his followers will believe him. But just as with the floods and windstorms and fires, an increasing number who have experienced Covid-19 personally have become hardened against his lies.
So, too, with the economic devastation that has come in the wake of the pandemic. Tens of millions are unemployed. Many are growing desperate. Almost everyone knows someone who has lost a job, or whose wages have been cut.
There’s an old saying that “the personal is political”. People understand politics most profoundly when it’s connected to their own lived experience.
At the Republican convention, Trump and his enablers can be expected to claim Democrats want to turn America into a socialist state. They’ll issue racist dogwhistles about “rioters and looters” in American cities. They’ll conjure up “deep state” conspiracies. They’ll lie about Biden.
Some Americans will believe this drivel, but I suspect the lived experience of most others – including many who voted for Trump in 2016 – will be more convincing.
After almost four years, we’ve felt the consequences of his rotten presidency first-hand. Trump’s malfeasance is now more palpable than his fearmongering. The personal is political.

Last modified on Sat 22 Aug 2020 14.10 BST
Two potential hurricanes are heading towards the northern Caribbean and mainland United States – with a third building in the Atlantic – in apparent confirmation of meteorologists’ predictions that the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season will become one of the worst on record.
The largest of the three, Tropical Storm Laura, was named on Friday, breaking the record for the earliest use of the letter L in a storm name in the region. Forecasts said it poses a potential hurricane threat to the US and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Cuba and possibly southern Florida in the coming days.
The US Gulf coast may be hit by two storms next week as Laura curves north towards Louisiana and another, Tropical Storm Marco, pushes north from the Yucatan peninsula.
“I’m usually pretty measured, calm and I avoid hyping things when it comes to tropical storms and hurricanes,” said Rob Lightbown of subscription forecast service Crownweather.com. “But I’m as worried right now as I have ever been regarding the forecast for the rest of the season.”
Mid-August to mid-September is considered the peak of Atlantic hurricane season, the period in which powerful storms most regularly develop as they cross the Atlantic.
Earlier this month, meteorologists unexpectedly increased their predictions of an “extremely active” season from a 60% chance to 85%.
The United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) now says the number of named storms could be between 19 and 25 – well above the yearly average of 12.
They blame extremely warm seas, unusually moist air and low winds in the upper atmosphere, estimating the amount of Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), an indicator of overall storm potential, to have risen from twice the usual average to between 140% and 230%.
The pandemic is a complicating factor. Some scientists say that reduced air traffic is affecting forecasts, as fewer planes are now collating weather information. “I do think this year’s reduced weather data from commercial aircraft has made a big difference,” said Lightbown.
In small Caribbean islands and large cities on the mainland, the threat of hurricanes is increasing pressure on emergency systems already strained by Covid 19. 
In the British Virgin Islands, a tiny archipelago in the north-east Caribbean with a population of just 30,000, the dangers of hurricanes are well known after category 5 Hurricane Irma devastated the islands in 2017.
“We’ve been giving out storm warnings earlier this year,” said Crystal Kanyuck-Abel, spokeswoman for the BVI Department of Disaster Management. “Because of Covid-19, we want to nudge people to act sooner and thereby reduce the dangers from everyone preparing at the last minute.”
So far, the BVI has seen just 12 cases of Covid-19, compared with almost 600,000 in southern Florida.
New storm shelter protocols in the BVI, Jamaica and other Caribbean islands closely resemble those of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but authorities across the region will probably be forced to improvise.
“We’ll give out masks and sanitiser, and screen everyone on entry,” says Kanyuck-Abel. “We’ve increased distances between beds, placing sleepers head-to-toe to decrease chances of air particle exchange, and created separation areas for those showing possible symptoms so health authorities can decide whether to isolate them further.”
In Florida, several areas most at risk from hurricanes have also seen high coronavirus caseloads, and mass evacuations are likely to lead not only to crowding, but mass movements of potential carriers.
“For counties that may be receiving evacuees, authorities should now be thinking about how to maintain the safety of the evacuees and the host population,” said Kristina Dahl, co-author of a recent study by Columbia University and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) looking at the potential impact of evacuation from southern Florida on Covid-19 numbers if a category 3 hurricane were to hit.
Using survey data gathered after Hurricane Irma in 2017, and comparing them with recent Covid-19 transmission rates, the study found that evacuation would lead to between 9,100 and 61,000 new coronavirus cases.
“The more we can do to keep evacuees from transmitting the virus to one another – housing evacuees in relatively private settings, mandating the use of face masks, and encouraging social distancing – the better off we’ll be after the storm passes,” said Dahl."

As more than 550 wildfires rip through California communities, forcing residents to flee their homes and leave behind treasured possessions, there are also an untold number of animal casualties. 
A heartbreaking video out of Solano county, where the LNU Lightning Complex fire has already scorched more than 219,000 acres and destroyed 480 structures, captures the emotional moment when a local rancher and dog trainer searched for her animals amid burned ruins. 
“Oh no, Oh no,” rancher Christa Patrillo Haefner says repeatedly as she searches in vain for the dozens of horses and baby goats lost to the inferno. Several horses, which were at a friends house, as well as some goats and pigs somehow survived the blaze — but most of her possessions, on which her livelihood depends, did not.
“We were just starting to recover from a house fire where we lost all of our personal belongings in 2018,” Patrillo Haefner told Good Day Sacramento, noting that she has lived through 14 fires in recent years. “Now we lost everything again.”
Each year, encroaching wildfires set off a scramble as animal owners hustle to rescue pets and livestock. Some animals find ways to save themselves by venturing into safe zones.
Others are rescued thanks to the help of good samaritans, like Ben Samrick, a Davis man who’s already rescued 30 horses by loading them in trailers and moving them to safer ground, like the an evacuation center for large animals that rescue workers have opened at the Solano county fairgrounds in Vallejo, which by Wednesday was home to 60 horses, cows, goats, chickens and emus.

Samirick told local ABC10 that animal owners need to prepare for evacuation by having enough equipment, halters and trailers available when time comes to leave.
Veterinarians at UC Davis have been able to treat a total of 13 animals injured by the LNU Lightning Complex Fire, including Ava, an 11-year-old draft horse – the sole survivor among six horses belonging to a nurse who lost her home, truck and trailer in the fire – as well as a Welsh pony named Puzzler and an alpaca dubbed Canelo.

But animals aren’t just victims to fires — they can also help prevent them. Last year, a heroic herd of 500 goats was credited with saving the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, outside of Los Angeles, who diligently ate their way through 13 acres of scrubland surrounding the library that would have fueled the fire that threatened the structure. One small town northeast of Sacramento last year launched a “goat fund me” to recruit a herd of horned heroes to stave off future wildfires.

Officials in Sonoma county, which has been badly damaged by this week’s fires, have reported that the federal wireless emergency alert service it uses is “no longer functioning”. 
The local Press Democrat reported that Chris Godley, the county’s emergency management director, told the board this alert service hasn’t been working as it is intended, including sending alerts to much wider areas than officials were targeting. It is supposed to send updates to phones in a specific area. One alert sent this morning linked to information from the Kincade fire last year, which also caused widespread confusion, he told the board of supervisors. 
Other alert services, such as Nixle, are working correctly, the newspaper reported. 
At its meeting this afternoon, the board also adopted an emergency proclamation, which will allow the region to receive more mutual aid and state funding.

Nearly 12,000 firefighters have joined efforts across the state, as have more than 1,000 fire engineers. 
California’s firefighting personnel are “on the scale of a small nation’s army”, climate scientist Daniel Swain recently told the Guardian. But the fires currently ripping through the state are so widespread, that crews have been stretched. 
During previous, massive fires – crews from all over the state could rush to the region worst affected. Right now, there’s too much going on – and Governor Gavin Newsom has called on the entire country to send help.

The coronavirus pandemic has complicated California’s wildfire response in many ways, layering crisis upon crisis. Health officials are worried that the smoke is leaving those with respiratory conditions – who are already especially prone to complications from Covid-19 – doubly vulnerable. 
There’s growing evidence that air pollution could exacerbate the severity of illness in coronavirus patients. Smoke also triggers coughing and sneezing, propelling farther the respiratory droplets that spread the coronavirus. 
Above all, the fires threaten to put even more pressure on already strained public health resources – with the threat of fire pulling hospitals and health centers out of service amid a health crisis that has already overwhelmed medical providers in some rural counties. 
Earlier this year, I took stock of the many ways in which the intersecting threats of fires and disease has put Californians in a precarious spot:

To put the current situation into perspective: 771,000 acres have burned in the past week. 
By comparison last year, a total of about 259,823 acres burned all year. That was a relatively mild fire year - these recent fires have yet to surpass the totals from 2018 and 2017, which saw some of the deadliest, most destructive fire seasons on record.
In 2018, a total of 1,963,101 acres burned and in 2017, 1,548,429 acres burned. 
In 2016, 669,534 acres burned. 
But peak fire season in California is in the autumn when the powerful Santa Ana winds in the south and the Diablo winds in the north tend to rapidly, and some times catastrophically stoke and spread embers into infernos.
Even relative to recent California firestorms, this is hard to process. And there's there's no real end in sight. Autumn offshore wind season--the period of peak fire risk in coastal California--is yet to come. And, of course, we are still in the middle of a respiratory pandemic.

Dr Stephanie Christenson, a University of California, San Francisco professor of medicine, noted in a news conference yesterday that the smoke could result in longer recovery time and possibly re-hospitalization among patients recovering from Covid, the New York Times reported. 
Christenson cautioned that it was too early to say with certainty how the smoke from wildfires could hamper Covid efforts, but noted that air pollution does inflame the lungs.

At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Thursday, Trump resurfaced a familiar broadside that California’s wildfires are of the state’s own making because the state has failed to take his advice to “clean” its forest floors of debris.
“They’re starting again in California,” Trump said of the wildfires raging across the state. 
“I said, you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests — there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they’re like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up,” he said. “Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us,” he added.
The argument dates back to 2018, when Trump visited the area burned by the Camp Fire, which killed 84 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. He said at the time that Finland’s “forest cities” have been able to avoid fires because they’ve spent “a lot of time raking” their forest floors. 
There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!
But the criticism conveniently overlooks the fact that the federal government controls most of the state’s forestland and that state and local agencies oversee just 3%. Forestry experts have disputed the president’s assertion, pointing out that the state’s most destructive recent fires have occurred in grasslands and oak-studded hillsides, San Francisco Chronicle reports. 
Development that has encroached on fire-prone areas has also played a role, as has climate change, which has meant prolonged periods of drought that’s turned wildlands into kindling. 
While Trump’s threats to withhold federal aid from California are familiar, so far they’ve proven empty. 
Last year, when the president leveled the same criticism at the Golden State, Governor Newsom clapped back pointedly, “You don’t believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation.”
You don’t believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation. https://t.co/PSt8N39Er5
Newsom also noted today that he had formed a new partnership with the federal government to work together on forest management – noting that the president might not have been aware of this arrangement when he made his remarks this week.

Governor Gavin Newsom is giving an update on the fires now, noting that the state is stretched thin while dealing with this “unprecedented moment” in California history. 
He said it was a challenge to respond to the 560 active fires still raging, which includes two dozen complex, major fires: “We are struggling.” 
The governor also noted that the state has been suffering from what may be the “hottest modern recorded temperatures in the history of the world”, adding, “That is a remarkable statement of fact.” 
The extreme heat wave has dramatically affected the entire region beyond California, he added: “The heat dome we experienced … has impacted the entire western United States. Fire conditions have increased in other states ... Our mutual aid that goes outside of the state of California has also been stretched.” Newsom said he was working with the states of Arizona and Oregon on mutual aid and had been in contact with officials in Canada. 
He specifically thanked the Trump administration for the Fema grants, a remark that came one day after the president, speaking at a campaign event, threatened to withhold funds to California. Countering the president’s partisan attacks, Newsom has tried to emphasize the bipartisan efforts to respond to the fires, including partnering with Republican governors.

The Woodward fire has grown to 2,100 acres at the Point Reyes national seashore, one of California’s most beloved national parks, just north of San Francisco. 
The fire was spreading in a remote area of Point Reyes in Marin county, and the popular trails in the area have been closed. The blaze is contributing to the heavy smoke and poor air quality in the region, including in San Francisco. The blaze has threatened more than 1,600 homes and businesses, and evacuation warnings remained in place for nearby towns. 
This fire also started with lightning strikes, and fire officials said this morning they were in the process of slowing its spread through aerial strikes.

Wildfires have been raging across California, ripping through wildlands as well as cities, towns and rural neighborhoods, forcing thousands of residents to flee amid a heatwave and the coronavirus pandemic. The blazes have blackened skies, spewing smoke across the Bay Area and sprinkling ash across the region.
Sparked by a rare lightning storm and stoked by hot, windy weather, the fires have expanded quickly into the Sierra Nevada, southern California, and regions north, east and south of San Francisco. Fire crews have been stretched thin, and Governor Gavin Newsom appealed to the whole country to help send personnel and equipment: “We are challenged right now.”
Here’s what you need to know about the crisis.
A confluence of extreme weather conditions set the stage, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. First came a record-breaking, continuing heatwave across the state. Temperatures in Death Valley hit 130F and the state saw rolling blackouts for the first time in nearly two decades as millions of Californians seeking to cool their homes strained the electrical grid.
Next, a tropical storm in the Pacific Ocean spun moisture toward California, triggering a rare lighting storm that zapped California more than 10,800 times over a three-day period, sparking small fires across the Bay Area and northern California. Then the humidity dropped and winds picked up, stoking the small flames until they erupted into full-blown infernos. On Saturday, one of the wildfires in northern California spawned a fire tornado – a 30,000ft smoky swirl that frizzled with lightning, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a first-of-its-kind weather alert.
The firenado died down, but many fires peppered across the state continued to expand. “Some of these fires started to merge, feeding off each others’ energy and growing even faster,” said Scott Stephens, a fire scientist at UC Berkeley. “Now many of these fires are changing behaviors and burning so quickly. It scares me because just so many people are in harm’s way.”
Quite the opposite. “It’s hard to even process,” Swain said.
The lighting storms that started the fires were an odd occurrence in the Bay Area – and the blazes they created are especially tricky to fight. At least in recent history, “most fires in California are started by humans”, explained Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced – sparked by power lines, equipment failures, car accidents and campfires. “And when fires are started by humans, they tend to happen in areas accessible to humans – close to roads and trails,” Kolden explained. “These fires are sometimes easier to spot and report quickly” and quell before they get too big, she said.
The recent lightning sparked many little fires, peppered across rough terrain – too remote for firefights to get to quickly, but also dangerously close to where Californians live. Storms do spark fires in California every year, but most big thunderstorms tend to land over the mountains – the Sierra Nevada, the Klamath Mountains, the Cascade Range, Stephens said. “That the lightning fell so close to urban areas was very unusual.”
Meanwhile, California’s landscape had been left parched by an extraordinarily dry winter and hot springtime and further desiccated by the historic heatwave that immediately preceded the lightning storms, turning vegetation into kindling that helped the little fires grow big and fierce, Swain said. He was struck by images of a vineyard near Vacaville, where flames cut through irrigation lines – which he expected would have broken their path. “I don’t think I’ve seen that before,” he said, noting that it spoke to how dry the landscape was.
Peak fire season is traditionally in the autumn, when volatile offshore winds spread hot embers into infernos. But these fires are growing so quickly that they’re creating their own winds. “These fires are doing such crazy things, they’re moving so fast, and they’re dangerous to approach,” Swain said. “It’s no wonder fire crews are overwhelmed.”
“These fires will be really tough to contain until this heatwave breaks,” Kolden said. And unfortunately, the weather outlook is “pretty hot, and pretty dry” for the next two weeks. The Bay Area National Weather Service is also forecasting the potential for more dry lightning this weekend – though a lot of uncertainty remains.
The fires are likely to continue for the coming two or three weeks, experts said. The best-case scenario is that some of the larger groupings of fires run out of fuel, hitting bodies of water or patches of land that have already burned in recent fires – and stay away from neighborhoods.
Swain said it was “unsettling” that the state had not even hit its peak wildfire season yet. “Right now, there’s no real end in sight.”
Disentangling the weather from the climate change is a perennial problem. “The specific set of circumstances that come together to create any specific fire are complex,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “But there’s no doubt that the risk of catastrophic wildfires is increasing dramatically because of climate change.”
Over the past few months, we’ve grown accustomed to talking about the underlying health conditions that make some people more vulnerable to Covid-19. In the case of fires, climate change is the underlying condition – subtly eating away at California’s landscape and making the state vulnerable to natural disaster.
“The latent potential for more extreme, more destructive fires is increasing year after year with every warmer year,” Swain said. In a paper published this month, Swain and his colleagues found that the frequency of autumn days with extreme, fire-fueling weather in California has more than doubled since the early 1980s. “The problem isn’t that wildfires are happening, it’s that the outcomes are worse when they do occur,” he explained.
Wildfires are natural and necessary in California, where the landscape has adapted to and evolved with fires. But in recent years, wildfires have been burning through more acreage, for longer stretches of time, devastating homes and neighborhoods — a sign that climate change has thrown off a natural balance of destruction and regrowth..
Broadly, yes.
Donald Trump had all the science wrong when he blithely suggested to Californians, “You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forest,” misunderstanding, for now, that it’s not just forests that burn, but also grasslands and chaparral. Residents have grown accustomed to hearing the president blame them for forest mismanagement and threaten to withhold money from their state while wildfires are burning – he did so in 2018 and 2019 – despite the fact that the federal government controls most of the forestland in California.
Still, there’s little doubt that a century of landscape mismanagement in California has helped fires become larger and more destructive.
Disregarding thousands of years of Indigenous ecological knowledge and land stewardship, the US government for years suppressed wildfires that were necessary to clear out overgrown vegetation and keep forests healthy. They shunned a practice, observed by hundreds of tribes in the region, of setting small, intentional fires to renew the landscape and prevent larger, more destructive wildfires – called “prescribed burns” – until very recently. Over decades, Californians also built their homes into wild landscapes particularly prone to fires, and continue to do so.
“Now, if we’re going to live with wildfire, we really have to get to work, managing the landscape to mitigate really catastrophic events,” Kolden said. That may mean more prescribed burns in some regions and sending crews of people, or goats, to thin out vegetation in other areas.
In recent years, firefighters and foresters have increased this sort of landscape management, but efforts were hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, which sidelined some fire crews and limited their work in large groups. Fire scientists also worry about the economic effects of pandemic-induced recession and cuts to the state’s budget for managing and mitigating fires."

First published on Fri 21 Aug 2020 19.13 BST
Wildfires in California have killed at least six people and forced tens of thousands from their homes, with few signs of reprieve in sight, as firefighting resources strain under the vastness of dozens of infernos raging across the state.
 More than 771,000 acres have burned so far, an area greater than the state of Rhode Island, California’s governor Gavin Newsom said at a press conference Friday.
He said the scope and ferocity of the fires has stretched thin the state’s capacity to respond in an “unprecedented moment” in California’s history, adding that he anticipated mutual aid support coming from Arizona, Oregon, Washington state, Texas, Nevada and elsewhere.
“We are struggling,” said Newsom.
Three major complexes encompassing dozens of fires chewed through forests, canyons and rural areas north, east and south of San Francisco Bay. Fires have scorched iconic redwoods within Big Basin, California’s oldest state park. Thousands of acres were ablaze elsewhere across California.
Skies remained darkened by smoke on Friday, with tens of thousands of homes threatened by flames that drove through dense and bone-dry trees and brush. Some fires doubled in size within 24 hours, fire officials said
Air quality in California has been among the world’s worst, leaving those with respiratory conditions – who are already vulnerable to Covid-19, especially vulnerable. The intersecting crises have also strained public health resources, with health officials expressing concern over growing evidence that air pollution could exacerbate the symptoms of coronavirus, and stoke the spread of disease. 
Many of the fires were sparked by an unusually high volume of lightning strikes during thunderstorms earlier this week, which came amid a searing heatwave.
The state was struck by lightning more than 12,000 times over the past four days, state fire officials said Friday. More than 560 separate blazes – which includes two dozen complex, major fires – are burning concurrently, officials reported.
The National Weather Service in the Bay Area warned there was a risk of another possible widespread lightning event this weekend.
Newsom noted that the state has been suffering from what may be the “hottest modern recorded temperatures in the history of the world”, adding, “That is a remarkable statement of fact.”
While evacuations were lifted in the small city of Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, other areas expanded their evacuation areas. The University of California, Santa Cruz, was evacuated and a new fire burning near Yosemite national park also prompted evacuations.
The mayor of Santa Cruz, a coastal city of 65,000, urged residents on Thursday evening to be prepared to evacuate by gassing up their vehicles and packing important documents, medicines and other belongings.
“Prepare early so that you are ready to go at a moment’s notice,” Cummings said.
Temperatures remained high, though were predicted to ease slightly on Friday. Erratic winds also could drive the fires unpredictably in multiple directions, challenging firefighting efforts, state fire officials said.
“There’s so much heat in these fires that they create their own wind … and they may blow in any direction, and very erratically,” said Daniel Berlant, an assistant deputy director with the state department of forestry and fire protection, known as Cal Fire.
As the fires rage, the state is facing a shortage of firefighters, due to a decline in available crews of incarcerated firefighters, which the state has long relied on despite widespread concerns about the ethics and labor issues surrounding use of imprisoned workers.
Newsom said the state has brought on more than 830 firefighters to backfill positions left vacant after some incarcerated firefighters were released from prison due to the Covid crisis.
The ferocity of the blazes so early in the year has astonished fire scientists. Typically, peak fire season in California is in the autumn, when powerful offshore winds stoke and spread embers into infernos. “There’s no real end in sight this year,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. 
Cal Fire’s Berlant said three civilians have died in Napa county and one in neighboring Solano county since the fires began. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the death toll included a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker who was found dead on Wednesday in a vehicle in the Vacaville area. Also, in central California, a pilot on a water-dropping mission in western Fresno county died on Wednesday morning when his helicopter crashed.
At least two other people were missing and more than 30 civilians and firefighters have been injured, authorities said.
The fires have destroyed at least 175 buildings, including homes, and threatened tens of thousands more.
Outside Fresno, in California’s central valley, 52-year-old helicopter pilot Mike Fournier was dropping water to beat back brush fires when his Bell UH-1 helicopter crashed, killing the pilot. The cause of the crash remains unclear.
More than 10,000 firefighters were on the front lines. Some 3,000 firefighters had arrived in the past 24 hours, along with hundreds of fire engines from other states, and National Guard troops that were staffing hand crews and flying helicopters, Berlant said.
More firefighters were sent to battle the complex of fires in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties but “it’s still not enough”, said Billy See, Cal Fire assistant chief.
“We’re still drastically short for a fire of this size,” he said.
The fires have once again brought the climate crisis to the fore. While wildfires are a natural part of California’s environment, they have grown increasingly ferocious in recent years amid intensifying drought and heat. In a video recorded for the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, Newsom warned: “If you are in denial about climate change, come to California.”
At a campaign stop yesterday in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding after he said the state has failed to heed his advice to clear debris from forest floors.
“They’re starting again in California,” Trump said of the raging wildfires.
“I said, you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests – there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they’re like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up,” he said. “Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us,” he added.
The president has made this argument annually in recent years, including in 2018, when he visited the area burned by the Camp fire, which killed 84 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. He said at the time that Finland’s “forest cities” have been able to avoid fires because they’ve spent “a lot of time raking” their forest floors.
The criticism belies a misunderstanding of how forest and landscape management work, and conveniently overlooks the fact that the federal government controls most of the state’s forestland and that state and local agencies oversee just 3%. 
Forestry experts have also pointed out that development that has encroached on fire-prone areas has also played a role in the fires, as has climate change, which has meant prolonged periods of drought that’s turned wildlands into kindling.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/21/us-hurricanes-simultaneous-tropical-storm-laura,US faces threat of two Caribbean storms hitting simultaneously as hurricanes,,"Tropical Storm Laura currently lies at other end of Caribbean to a separate tropical depression
Last modified on Fri 21 Aug 2020 16.18 BST
A tropical storm and a tropical depression at opposite ends of the Caribbean were projected to possibly become hurricanes, major storms which could hit the US simultaneously after drenching much of the region.
The US mainland has not been hit by two tropical storms simultaneously since September 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression. Then, a category 3 hurricane hit Brownsville, Texas, while a tropical storm came ashore at Cedar Key, Florida.
On Friday morning, Tropical Depression 13 became Tropical Storm Laura as it neared the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico as a disorganized storm with an uncertain future. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it might degenerate, or might blow up into a major hurricane headed for Florida and the Gulf coast.
The current forecast track, highly uncertain, would carry Laura just north of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, across the Bahamas and then to southern Florida by Monday or Tuesday and the Gulf coast.
On Friday morning, it was centered about 255 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and was heading west-northwest at 21mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 35mph.
Tropical Depression 14, meanwhile, was nearing the coast of Honduras. The NHC said it was expected to veer north-west and cut across Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula on Sunday, possibly at or near hurricane force. A hurricane watch was in effect for the strip of coast containing Tulum, Playa del Carmen and Cancún, as well as Cozumel island.
From there, the long-term forecast track would carry it to the US Gulf coast, perhaps Texas or Louisiana, by Tuesday or Wednesday – again, possibly, as a hurricane. En route, it is likely to soak flood-prone eastern Honduras, the Cayman Islands and parts of the Yucatán.
On Friday morning, it was centered about 160 miles east of the Honduran resort island of Roatán with 35mph winds. It was headed west-north-west at 12 mph.
In the Pacific, former category 4 Hurricane Genevieve was weakening and heading further out to sea after a glancing blow to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, where it caused at least two deaths and knocked out power to a large part of the Los Cabos area.
The NHC said Genevieve, now a tropical source, had maximum sustained winds of 45mph and was centered about 145 miles west of Cabo San Lázaro, Mexico. It was heading west-northwest at 9mph."

Just look to California’s abnormal wildfires,,"In the last decade, amid drought and searing heat, California has entered the ‘era of megafires’ and has become the ‘examplar for climate change extreme events today’
Last modified on Sat 22 Aug 2020 20.07 BST
There’s an idea that when the climate crisis begins, we will know it. Movies present it as a moment when the world’s weather suddenly turns apocalyptic: winds howl, sea levels surge, capital cities are decimated. Climate messaging can bolster this notion, implying that we have a certain number of years to save the day before reaching a cataclysmic point of no return.
Living in expectation of a definitive global break can blind us to the fact that gradually, insidiously, the climate crisis has already arrived.
In few places is this as clear as California, where extreme wildfires have become the new abnormal. There is currently a “fire siege” in northern California, with wildfires burning in every one of the nine Bay Area counties except for San Francisco, which is entirely urbanized. Tens of thousands of residents have evacuated and people are choking on smoke.
The circumstances of these blazes are unusual. They began with a tropical storm deteriorating in the Pacific Ocean, spinning off moisture in the direction of California. As it made landfall in the San Francisco region over the weekend, it sparked a remarkable lightning storm, and 10,849 lightning strikes were tallied in three days.
Over millennia California’s landscape has adapted to burn, with some tree species requiring the heat of flames to open their seed cases, and lightning-sparked wildfires are not unusual. But the state has been experiencing unheard-of heat, and just logged what may have been the hottest ever temperature recorded on earth: 129.9F in Death Valley, a few hundred miles southeast of the Bay Area lightning swarm. Vegetation is achingly dry and primed to ignite.
California’s governor announced on Wednesday that there were 367 fires, and conflagrations have grown so rapidly that there are not enough firefighters to tackle them all. Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist, told us in an interview that he was watching the current fires with “incredulity”.
“It seems like every year re-ups the previous year in terms of pushing the envelope, in terms of how much fire we’re seeing in the landscape and how severe that fire is,” he said.
There were also, by the by, several fire tornadoes at the weekend. Witnessing these phenomena, another fire expert remarked that California “is the exemplar for climate change extreme events today”.
In the last decade, amid drought and searing heat, California has entered the “era of megafires”. Our new book, Fire in Paradise, tells the story of a town that was almost entirely wiped out by a fire of unheralded speed in 2018. It killed 85 people, making it the deadliest ever fire in California. Other notable blazes include a 1,000-ft wide fire tornado that churned through the town of Redding a few months before the Paradise catastrophe, and fires in California’s Wine Country that killed 44 people.
All of this is why, as we scan the headlines for the planetary shift that will mark the true arrival of the climate crisis, we risk losing sight of the fact that places like California are already experiencing it.
This is not entirely surprising. According to the ecological theory of “shifting baselines”, we do not notice the degradation of the natural world because little by little we get used to it, like a frog in hot water. We think that it has always been this way.
Once, for example, the passenger pigeon was the most abundant bird in North America, perhaps the world. Observers in the 19th century described great flocks so loud that you couldn’t hold a conversation and so large they blocked the sun: “The light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse”.
Yet slowly, as a result of overhunting and habitat destruction, they vanished into extinction, and most of us do not miss them because we have never known anything else. Our expectations of the natural world are simply different.
When it comes to California wildfires, the ground has been moving under our feet for decades, as heat rises, snowpacks shrink, and plants dry out. The baseline has shifted. How long before we forget that it was ever otherwise?

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/20/california-wildfires-latest-lightning-fire-bay-area,California wildfires: firefighters stretched thin as blazes grow rapidly,,"First published on Thu 20 Aug 2020 22.23 BST
Wildfires continue to sear through California, forcing thousands out of their homes and taxing the state’s firefighting capacity amid a heatwave and the coronavirus pandemic. One grouping of fires – the LNU Lightning Complex north of the Bay Area – grew rapidly overnight, doubling in size to about 131,000 acres by Thursday, and burning through more than 100 homes and buildings.
The fires have so far destroyed 175 structures, including homes, and are threatening 50,000 more, said Daniel Berlant, an assistant deputy director with the state department of forestry and fire protection. In all, 33 civilians and firefighters have been injured.
At least two people have died fighting the fires – a pilot on a water-dropping mission whose helicopter crashed and a utility worker who was assisting at a fire in the Vacaville area.
As the flames edged toward the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, they blackened the skies and spewed up what was perhaps some of the worst air quality in the world. Ash blanketed many Bay Area neighborhoods, and health officials asked residents to stay indoors, warning that the combination of smoky air and Covid-19 make those with respiratory conditions doubly vulnerable.
Big Basin Redwoods state park, California’s oldest state park and home of some of its majestic redwoods, sustained “extensive damage”, according to the state parks and recreation department, with several historic buildings destroyed.
 About two dozen major blazes and several smaller fires have eaten through brushland and dense forests, wildlands in the Sierra Nevada, southern California, and regions north, east and south of San Francisco.
Evacuated residents now number in the tens of thousands, with Santa Cruz county requesting that all tourists leave their hotels immediately to make space for evacuees.
“Local shelters are near capacity,” local officials said in a statement. “The scale of existing and anticipated evacuation orders is unprecedented and the need to safely house evacuees is critical.”
The coronavirus pandemic has also complicated the government’s ability to safely evacuate and shelter residents. The Red Cross has tried to secure hotel rooms for evacuees who are unable to stay with family or friends. “Providing shelter at traditional evacuation centers is not our first option this year,” said Jim Burns, a spokesman for the American Red Cross. California has been struggling to get a handle on a recent surge in coronavirus cases, and crowded shelters could exacerbate the spread of Covid-19 among evacuees.
Local counties and the Red Cross have set up some shelters across the state, and as precautions “have spaced out cots differently, and have volunteers completely masked up”, to slow the spread of disease, Burns said. “It’s just so tough this year.”
Through local Facebook community pages, and in group text chains, neighbors have been offering each other help moving farm animals, storage space for personal possessions and shelter in guest bedrooms and on couches. “I’ve had people I barely, know – friends of friends – reach out and say, ‘You can come and stay with us,’” said Valerie Arbelaez Brown, who evacuated her home in Vacaville with her husband and three children on Wednesday. “It makes us feel really thankful,” she said after her family eventually landed with family north of the fires.
In some areas, evacuees with underlying health conditions that elevate their risk of dying from Covid-19, have camped outside evacuation centers, stayed in RVs or in their cars.
The LNU fires raging through Napa and Sonoma – California’s famous wine-producing regions – now threaten 25,000 buildings, according to Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency. At one vineyard in the area, fire ate through irrigated vines, noted Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. “I don’t think I’ve seen that before,” he told the Guardian. Normally, the irrigation lines would break the flames – that they didn’t speaks to how dry the landscape is, Swain said.
Another group of fires, called the CZU August Lightning Complex, chewed through mountainous areas surrounding Silicon Valley, forcing 22,000 to flee their homes. The conditions were “unprecedented and unseen by veteran firefighters”, Cal Fire officials said.
Donald Trump addressed the wildfires at a press conference on Thursday, once again blaming California’s forest management for the wildfires and renewing threats to withhold aid because California “didn’t listen” to him.
In 2019, a total of about 259,800 acres across the state had burned by the end of the year. Since this Saturday, nearly 400,000 acres burned just in northern California. “Last year was a relatively mild fire year, but nonetheless,” Swain said, “I think that helps put the severity of the current situation in perspective.”
Firefighters said both personnel and equipment were stretched thin, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, this week declared a state of emergency, and appealed to the whole country to send help. In Marin county, north of San Francisco, fire chief Jason Weber told the AP he was awaiting assistance from Montana. “We’ve never seen this level of draw-down” in his 25 years of service, he said.
More than 10,000 firefighters are on the frontlines, but fire officials in charge of each of the major fire complexes say they are strapped for resources. Some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours.
No sign of abatement is in sight, said Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at the University of California, Merced. The next two weeks are expected to remain hot and dry. “The fires will be tough to contain until the heatwave breaks,” she said.
Due to global heating, fires in California are “becoming more frequent and more extreme”, Kolden said. “And that’s what’s sort of the eye opener here. We probably couldn’t have predicted, a year ago, that a pandemic and a lightning storm, and a heat wave would come this August,” she said. “But we can predict that overall, we need to get more aggressive mitigating for fire long term.”

For those keeping track, California is currently fighting three lightning complex fires: the CZU August Lightning Complex Fire, the LNU Lightning Complex Fire and the SCU Lightning Complex Fire.
The initials represent the locations and different units of each Cal Fire agency battling the fires: CZU is the Santa Cruz-San Mateo unit, LNU is the Lake/Napa/Sonoma county region and SCU covers Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Stanislaus and San Joaquin. 
They’re called complex fires because they’re complicated. Only partially kidding - basically, these three blazes had at least two or more fires within them that were assigned to the same incident. It can be hard to picture because when a fire gets a name, you tend to conjure up this image of this giant monolithic monster of flames. In reality, a wildfire is more a series of hotspots and flare-ups than anything else, sometimes spread out by miles, and a wildfire complex, even more so.

In a way, Donald Trump is not entirely incorrect when he talks about “cleaning your floors” - clearing vegetation is a big part of wildfire prevention and prep that take place every year. But California’s wildfires have gotten deadlier and more destructive in recent years not just because of forest management. 
The fires of the past few years aren’t just sweeping through forests - they’re taking out entire towns and they’re ripping up whole neighborhoods where people live. A large part of this is because of the climate crisis. As the Guardian’s former environmental reporter Susie Cagle wrote during last year’s fire season, the climate crisis “has sped up California’s natural cyclical weather patterns and made the age-old threat of fire into an acute and repetitive trauma”. 
Fall is traditionally fire season for California, as the Diablo winds in the north and Santa Ana winds in the south blow down the hillsides and across forests and brushland that has dried out from the summer heat, but not yet wetted by winter rains. Extreme winds make the vegetation especially flammable, and threaten to whip up flames and carry hot embers further and faster, creating new “spot” fires across the landscape.

Donald Trump is once again talking about cleaning the forest floors, just as he had two years ago when he visited Paradise, a town devastated by the Camp Fire.
Because time is a flat circle. 
“I see again the forest fires are starting again in California,” Trump said. “You got to clean your floors, clean your floors...I’ve been telling them this for three years, but they don’t want to listen.”

It was amidst talks of clean floors and not heeding his advice on the value of a clean forest floor that he made his statement about withholding aid: “Maybe we’re just gonna have to make them pay for it, because they don’t listen to us,” he said. 
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Mother Nature doesn’t discriminate when she strikes, whether it’s a hurricane or tornado or earthquake or wildfire. That’s why we are the United States, we unite to help each other when disaster hits. Still surprised I have to explain that to you. https://t.co/JVkh7UPB0c

As California burns, Donald Trump threatens to withhold aid.
Trump on fire assistance to California: ""Maybe we're just gonna have to make them pay for it, because they don't listen to us.""
According to Republican Voters Against Trump, it wouldn’t be the first time. 
“He told us to stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down because he was so rageful that people in the state of California didn’t support him and that politically it wasn’t a base for him,” Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, said in a video. 
This is f*cking crazy. @realDonaldTrump told @fema to cut off funding to fire victims because CA is not part of his base. Wildfires devastated parts of my district and I saw firsthand the destruction. I will be asking the IG to investigate. Because we are all Americans. https://t.co/fQ5s7mj76s

While the largest and most concerning fires are farther north, which is experiencing the worst air pollution in the world, southern California is also struggling with extremely challenging weather conditions and continued coronavirus threats. In recent days, the sprawling LA region has been plagued by record-breaking high temperatures, smoke-filled air, foggy conditions and “unhealthy” and “very unhealthy” levels of pollution.
The heat is supposed to last into the weekend, and officials are urging people to stay indoors, which has created an extra burden as some activities, such as dining and fitness, have moved outside due to Covid. 
The Apple fire, east of LA, was 95% contained and at 33,400 acres as of Thursday. That fire has exacerbated pollution in Riverside county and the industrial area known as the Inland Empire, which is known for having some of the worst air quality across the US.
The Lake fire, in the northern part of LA county, was at 27,000 acres and 48% contained as of Thursday morning. The Holser fire, in Ventura county (near the coast and also north of LA) was at 3,000 acres and 30% contained. 
Across the LA area, authorities also issued an advisory for ozone pollution due to the heat and fires.

In addition to the wildfires plaguing the Bay Area and forcing evacuations, a number of blazes are burning through national forests at the moment. 
The Loyalton Fire burning in Tahoe National Forest famously set off a “fire tornado” warning a few days back. It has since grown to 46,617 acres and is 38% contained. Officials lifted mandatory evacuations in this area.

Across the state in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Bell Fire burns in Stanislaus National Forest at 31 acres. Like the Loyalton Fire and many of the blazes in the Bay Area, officials believe it was sparked by lightning. 
The Beach Fire burns in Inyo National Forest at 3,780 acres.

The PG&E troubleman killed while working the #LNULightningComplex fire in Vacaville has been identified as 60-year-old Steve Wink. @KQEDnews
The union that represents PG&E employees said in a statement that he leaves behind his wife and three daughters. According to preliminary reports, he was assisting first responders in the fire zone when he died.
Some context: Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has a long history of sparking wildfires. Last year, the company filed for bankruptcy, in part because its attorneys said it could not afford to pay all the potential wildfire liabilities. The company chose to cut power to unprecedented swaths of the state during last year’s fire season rather than shoulder the risk of sparking another wildfire.
Critics and state watchdogs have long said that poor maintenance and an aging infrastructure were to blame for PG&E’s roles in these fires, and that the company should have been more diligent in their care of the grid. In keeping infrastructure like electrical poles and lines clear of vegetation, workers like Steve Wink are lowering the chances of more fires sparking and spreading and causing even more destruction. They’re making sure emergency responders have clear paths to access what they need. Steve Wink was doing important work when he died.

Farther north, the LNU Lightning Complex fire has forced hundreds to flee their homes in both mandatory and non-mandatory evacuations. 
This blaze is burning in a variety of locations across five counties in Napa, Sonoma, Lake, Yolo and Solano. It has grown to an estimated 131,000 acres and is 0% contained.

This is a region that has been hard-hit by wildfires in the past few years. Starting in 2015, the Valley fire, the fifth most destructive fire in California history, ripped through Napa, Sonoma and Lake counties, killing four and burning up nearly 2,000 structures. In 2017, the Tubbs fire struck Napa and Sonoma, killing 22 and destroying more than 5,600 structures to earn itself the no 2 spot on the most destructive list. Around that same time, the Nuns fire - no 9 on the list - burned through Sonoma, killing three and burning more than 1,300 structures. 
Rebuilding for these communities has been a nightmare. With so much need for construction and materials - in addition to personal homes, infrastructure and government projects damaged in the fires required attention - many victims who lost everything were still struggling, years after the fires.

California’s oldest state park, home of some of its majestic redwoods, has “sustained extensive damage”, according to the state parks and recreation department.
The fire dubbed the CZU August Lightning Complex that is burning in various locations in Santa Cruz county and San Mateo county reached Big Basin Redwoods state park on Tuesday. 
The blaze “damaged the park’s headquarters, historic core and campgrounds”, according to park officials. Campers, day-use visitors and staff at both Little Basin and Big Basin were evacuated. 
As of Thursday, the fire was estimated to have grown to 40,000 acres and was 0% contained. Cal Fire issued mandatory evacuations for parts of Santa Cruz county today.

The National Weather Service offers us a glance at the scope of what the San Francisco Bay Area is facing when it comes to the wildfires. 
One look at the Night Fog product on satellite and you can see the wildfires (the dark spots) all around the #BayArea and the #CentralCoastThere is stratus (the blue) making its way down the Pacific coast, but it's remaining farther off shore to provide substantial help.#CAwx pic.twitter.com/KEQPNs7s6n
Some context: the San Francisco Bay Area is a region consisting of nine counties sprawled over just a hair under 7,000 square miles. About 7.7 million people live here. 
It’s home to Silicon Valley and tech giants like Apple and Facebook. While it indeed has urban hubs in San Francisco and Oakland, the Bay Area has a fair amount of open space in its suburbs, nature and agriculture - it’s home to the rolling wine country vineyards of Sonoma and Napa counties as well. Read: it has a fair amount of fuel for wildfires to bring the flames ever closer to populated centers and threaten houses, businesses and lives. "

Anxiety grows as China’s Three Gorges dam hits highest level

Extreme floods have hit China’s Three Gorges dam, which recorded the largest inflow of water in its history, prompting officials to assure the public it would not be breached.
Inflows to the world’s largest hydro-electric dam reached 75m litres of water a second, according to state media. By Thursday morning, 11 outlets of the dam had been opened to discharge 49.2m litres of water a second, the largest release since its construction.
After two months of heavy floods across central and south-west China, officials have promised the dam can withstand the flows.
A breach of the dam, a controversial and unprecedented feat of engineering along the Yangtze River, would be embarrassing for China, which took 12 years to build the megaproject, displacing millions and submerging swathes of land.
The Three Gorges dam, which can handle inflows of about 98.8m litres a second, is already approaching its capacity. Officials expect water levels in the reservoir, whose dam was built to withstand a water level of 175 metres, to reach 165.5 metres on Saturday. The flooding is predicted to last about five days.
This week the ministry of water resources said the standard of construction meant 111 large reservoirs upstream from the dam could help lessen pressure on the structure. “The standard of construction of the dam is high and it can resist large floods,” it said.
Upstream from the dam, officials in the city of Chongqing, in Sichuan province, evacuated almost 300,000 residents before the flooding. On Thursday, levels along the Yangtze near Chongqing reached heights not seen since 1981, when the country experienced its worst floods in a century, leaving 1.5 million homeless.
In Chongqing, roads, bridges, parks and a main highway in the commercial district were flooded, affecting 260,000 people and damaging at least 20,000 businesses, according to officials.
Images showed flooding had submerged three-metre-high signs and buildings several storeys high. Firefighters were using boats to transport trapped residents.
In Sichuan, emergency workers and volunteers were scrambling to protect a 1,200-year-old cultural relic, the Leshan Giant Buddha, as floodwaters reached the toes of the statue for the first time since 1949.
The provinces of Hunan, Henan and Hubei, where the Three Gorges dam is located, were also braced for heavy rain on Thursday.
The flooding threatens to derail the country’s fragile recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. The outbreak has caused an estimated 179bn yuan in losses and displaced more than 4 million people, according to officials.
The floods have also raised concerns about food security. A report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the supply gap was likely to be about 130m tons by the end of 2025.
The Chinese leader toured Anhui province this week, another badly hit area where floods had eased slightly. Xi Jinping stood atop a floodgate and visited soldiers, declaring: “I have always been concerned about the people in flood-stricken areas. The Chinese nation has fought natural disasters for thousands of years … We will continue to fight.”"

Associated Press have just field an updated report from Vacaville where there are multiple evacuation orders in place. 
One resident, Karen Hansen, described the scene: “The whole sky was red orange and it was coming over the hill there and it was massive. I’ve never seen anything like it and it only took a few minutes to get here.”
She evacuated her Vacaville home late on Tuesday as flames rushed toward her family’s small farm, packing up her smaller animals but unable to bring along two beloved horses. They returned Wednesday to find the house and barn destroyed, but their horses had survived.
“I’m not upset about the house. Im just happy that my horses and animals are alive and my daughter,” she said.
However, with I-80 freeway closed in both directions for much of the day many people have chosen to stay in their homes.

Still on the wider implications of the wildfires, Associated Press has spoken to a fire scientist about the link between Coid-19 and the fires. 
Jennifer Balch at the University of Colorado says the virus is forcing us into the outside where transmission is lower. But the fires are leaving people with no option but to shelter indoors.
“These disasters need solutions that are in direct conflict with each other,” she said. “Covid-19 is forcing us outside to reduce transmission risk while extreme wildfire smoke is forcing us back inside where the air is better. We’re running out of options to cope, under the weight of compound disasters.”
And there’s also the issue we’ve touched on already about how the lockdown in prisons has deprived firefighters of their usual backup from crews of inmates.

As we said earlier, residents in California have been urged to conserve power as the wildfires raging across the state trigger outages on the electricity grid. 
It has people sweltering in their homes as they are unable to use their air-conditioning or even fans to keep cool. 
One of the worst hit areas is the Bay Area, where the air quality slumped to the worst in the world on Wednesday with another equally bad day due on Thursday.
Erin DeMerritt, of the Bay Area air quality management district, suggested visiting cooling centers where they were available or any indoor space with filtered air while following mask-wearing and social distancing protocols.
It’s also important to note that bandannas and masks used to protect yourself from the coronavirus do nothing to protect against smoke from wildfires.

The Sacramento Bee has an interesting story saying that there is a shortage of firefighters this summer because hundreds of prison inmates in Lassen county who are usually deployed to help in the effort are locked down because of Covid-19.
According to the report, “only 30 of the state’s 77 inmate crews are available to fight a wildfire in the north state”, citing prison officials.
It adds:
California’s incarcerated firefighters have for decades been the state’s primary firefighting “hand crews,” and the shortage has officials scrambling to come up with replacement firefighters in a dry season that is shaping up to be among the most extreme in years. The state is hunting for bulldozer crews and enlisting teams that normally clear brush as replacements.

There are now hundreds of fires blazing across California, but where exactly is affected and how will it be contained? Here is what we know so far.
Firefighters in the state are battling 367 known fires, Gavin Newsom, the California governor, said in a press conference on Wednesday. Many of these are in northern California, fueled by climate change-induced drought coupled with high heat and major storms in the state in recent days.
More than 10,849 lightning strikes in the last 72 hours have created more than 367 new fires, according to Cal Fire, the California Department of Forest and Fire Protection.
There are currently 8,900 personnel making up 13 teams across California to fight the fires, the agency said.
Cal Fire is collectively referring to the wildfires that broke out this week as the Lightning Complex fires. This is because most of them were sparked by lightning and are “complex” fires, meaning there are two or more fires concentrated in one general location. 
Fire services distinguishing between the largest active incidents as follows.
LNU Lightning Complex: LNU stands for Cal Fire’s Lake-Napa Unit. LNU Lightning Complex thus refers to the fire that began in Napa county on 18 August and has since expanded to Solano and Yolo counties, primarily affecting the neighborhoods on the western edge of Vacaville. It has burnt more than 46,000 acres and is 0% contained as of 1.40pm PST on Wednesday.
Within the LNU Lightning Complex are a number of individual fires including the Hennessy fire, Gamble fire, Green fire, Markley fire, Spanish fire, Morgan fire, Wallbridge fire and Myers fire. 
SCU Lightning Complex: SCU stands for Santa Clara Unit, and SCU Lightning Complex refers to the fire that began in Santa Clara county on 18 August and has since spread to parts of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties. So far, 85,000 acres have burned and the fire is less than 5% contained as of 3.30pm PST on Wednesday. 
The SCU Lightning complex includes more than 20 fires in addition to an 800-acre brush fire in Point Reyes national seashore. They are divided into three zones: Calaveras zone, Canyon zone and Deer zone.
CZU Lightning Complex: CZU stands for San Mateo-Santa Cruz Unit, referring to the fire that began in Santa Cruz on 17 August and has since spread to parts of San Mateo county. So far 10,000 acres have burned and the fire is 0% contained as of 4pm PST on Wednesday.
The CZU Lightning complex includes the 5-15 fire, 5-18 fire, 5-14 fire, Waddell fire and Warrenella fire.

Wildfires have forced Californians from their homes and into evacuation shelters, but the pandemic is complicating efforts to safely feed and house evacuees.
At one evacuation site at the fairgrounds in Santa Cruz, workers set up a dozen large tents inside a large warehouse-like building, with each tent spaced six feet apart. Site organizers, wearing protective masks and gloves, took evacuees’ temperature once they were allowed inside the shelter, reported the Mercury News.
In years past, dozens of cots would have been lined up just a couple feet apart. But things have changed, said one rescue worker: “You can’t do that in Covid and expect a pure result,” he said. 
Elsewhere, in Sonoma county, officials raced to establish a separate evacuation center for anyone with symptoms of Covid-19. And a number of sites are hustling to secure hotel rooms to house the recently displaced. 
“Go where you can congregate with the smallest amount of people you can – that would be preferable,” one Stanford doctor said. “It’s not going to be ideal no what matter what we do.”

Fires burning in all but one of the nine counties surrounding the San Francisco Bay area has created the worst air quality in the world.
An air quality map from the San Francisco Chronicle shows fires that are ringing the metro area and the poor air that’s settled over the region.
So what does poor air quality mean for people recovering from Covid-19? 
“People are already worried about catching the virus and becoming ill. Having respiratory problems and other problems, and then having a natural disaster to deal with or multiple fires going on during fire season is not pleasant,” Vinayak Jha, a San Francisco pulmonologist, told the Chronicle.
Breathing in wildfire smoke can cause shortness of breath, coughing and sore throat and could exacerbate symptoms of Covid-19, he said. 
Wildfire smoke is like tobacco smoke without the nicotine, said a professor of medicine and environmental health sciences. When burned, it produces carbon particles with toxic hydrocarbons. 
When inhaled, the fine particles make it deep into the lungs, causing inflammation. The condition has been found in the lungs of firefighters. The closer someone is to the fire, the more risk of inflammation. 
A growing number of reports emerging from China, Europe and the US suggest that poor air quality is associated with increased Covid cases and deaths, Jha said.

Hundreds of fires are raging across California, forcing tens of thousands of residents – who were already facing blackouts and the coronavirus pandemic – to flee their homes. The flames, sparked by lightning and stoked by a searing heatwave and ferocious winds, have been moving quickly, overwhelming the state’s firefighters and first responders.
“It’s kind of an overwhelming fire siege,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA’s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.
The state is currently battling 367 known fires, Gavin Newsom reported at a press conference on Wednesday. “We are challenged right now,” the governor said. The state was struck by lightning 10,849 times over the course of 72 hours, he said.
The unusual lightning storm and a historic heatwave have led to an especially fierce fire season this year, officials said. The lack of backup from crews made up of prisoners has also hindered the firefighting effort because the inmates are locked down in jail due to Covid-19.
Asked how officials will manage the overlapping crises of heat, fire and the pandemic all at once, Newsom responded: “The future happens here first.”
A cluster of wildfires in Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties now covers an estimated 46,225 acres, according to Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency. The flames have destroyed at least 50 buildings and structures and remain largely uncontained, and come just three years after devastating fires killed 22 and destroyed many wineries in the region.
In central California, a pilot on a water-dropping mission in western Fresno county died after his helicopter crashed on Wednesday morning, Cal Fire said in a statement.
At dawn on Wednesday, firefighters and police officers went door-to-door in Vacaville, in Solano county, rushing to evacuate residents. At least 50 structures were destroyed and four people were injured, according to officials. Television reporters and local residents shared images of roads, fully flanked by flames, blackened land and columns of smoke swirling through neighborhoods. Ash sprinkled swaths of the state, dusting cities in gray.
The night before, the sky had been glowing red and clouds of smoke were raining ash down Valerie Arbelaez Brown’s street. So when a neighbor knocked on her door at 4.30am, urging her to evacuate, she told her four kids to grab their most precious possessions – “the things money can’t buy” – and tucked the whole family into the car.
Arbelaez Brown, who had worked as a disaster relief responder for the Red Cross, said she had been trained to keep her wits about but was nonetheless shaken by the fire’s ferocity. “The fire was moving so fast – and it was engulfing everything around us,” she said. “My 14-year-old was freaking out, crying. But I explained to the kids we can replace things, we can rebuild the house. As long as we’re safe.”
Terilyn Steverson, 28, said she felt helpless much of Wednesday as she waited to hear about the fate of the Vacaville home she grew up in – a home that has been in her family since the 1970s. She described driving into a hellscape of fire with her sister overnight, as they raced to collect their uncle, who is mentally disabled and requires care, from a friend’s home in Vacaville. “At three, four in the morning, the sky was just orange,” she said.
“There was just this glow of orange and red. We hit Vallejo and there’s this light ash falling from the sky. We get closer and closer and the closer we get to Vacaville, the thicker the smoke is and the thicker the ash is that is falling from the sky. It was so scary.”
Fires were burning in every Bay Area county but urban San Francisco. “So basically, everywhere there’s land to burn, there’s land burning in the Bay Area,” Swain said.
As a result, the San Francisco Bay Area was experiencing the worst air quality in the world on Wednesday. Smoke hung heavy over the region and residents reported ash falling from the sky.
What it’s like to live in California right now. My car was JUST washed and all of this is ash from the wildfires surround us. ITS LITERALLY RAINING ASHES!!!! pic.twitter.com/XB4iLaG9l5
The ash and soot, which have permeated through the state are especially concerning amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
The American Lung Association urged people to take greater caution, saying the poor air quality could exacerbate breathing problems for people at-risk of contracting Covid-19.
“The combination of uncontained wildfires and extreme heat has created conditions that put even healthy individuals at risk,” Afif El-Hasan, an association spokesman, told the Los Angeles Times. “The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic only makes these potential effects more serious.”
In southern California, the Lake fire north-east of Los Angeles has been raging for more than a week, spreading across more than 21,000 acres. The Dome fire has eaten through more than 43,000 acres including the Mojave national preserve near the California-Nevada border – scorching ancient Joshua trees.
On Tuesday, Newsom, the California governor, declared a state of emergency, looking to mobilize help from within and outside California. “We are deploying every resource available to keep communities safe as California battles fires across the state during these extreme conditions,” Newsom said. “California and its federal and local partners are working in lock step to meet the challenge and remain vigilant in the face of continued dangerous weather conditions.”
The heatwave that began this weekend and the rare lightning storms that spawned even rarer fire tornadoes, “really set the stage for something that can be truly catastrophic”, he said.
Nearly 7,000 firefighters are currently on the frontlines but the state has still been forced to call in for backing, requesting 375 fire engines from neighboring states. Arizona and Nevada have sent equipment to California and Texas has offered to send firefighting crews, Newsom said.
“Throughout the state of California right now, we are stretched thin for crews,” Will Powers, a state fire spokesman told the AP. “Air resources have been stretched thin throughout the whole state.” 
The difficult job of fighting fires has been made even harder this year by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Many of the incarcerated laborers relied upon to fight fires are out of commission due to outbreaks in prisons across the state. Prisoners are crucial in the state’s fire response plan, fighting fires in exchange for wages as low as $2 an hour and reduced sentences.
Non-incarcerated firefighters who are able to work risk contracting Covid-19 themselves. Most firefighters stay in makeshift communities near the hot zones, sleeping close together. A Covid-19 outbreak could quickly sweep through such camps, and exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen Covid-19 symptoms and outcomes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 “The problem that we face now is that there’s no obvious way to control these fires,” Chris Field, the director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, said – because they are burning through areas replete with dry wood and brush. “It’s just really hard to stop them once they’ve picked up.”
The National Interagency Fire Center had warned of a higher potential for fires across much of America’s west and south-west, with 2020 on track to be one of the hottest and driest years on record. This winter, not a single drop of rain fell on San Francisco and Sacramento in February – and a hot spring dried out fire-fueling vegetation through much of the state.
“We’re in an era in California and in the west where wildfires risk increasing year on year, increasing dramatically because of climate change,” Field said. “This is going to be our new reality.”"

Floods on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river in south-west China have forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people and threatened a 1,200-year-old world heritage site.
Staff, police and volunteers used sandbags to try to protect the 71-metre (233ft) Leshan Giant Buddha, a Unesco world heritage site in the south-west Sichuan province, as muddy flood water rose over its toes for the first time since 1949, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
However, the worst of the flooding appeared to be over in Sichuan by Wednesday when the emergency level was lowered and the toes of a famous Buddhist statue re-emerged as waters receded.
Five people were missing in neighbouring Yunnan province in the south-west after a landslide destroyed two houses, the official People’s Daily newspaper said.
In Sichuan, 21 vehicles parked in a square in Yibin fell into a hole after the road beneath them collapsed in the middle of the night. No one was injured, according to media reports.
Flooding has left more than 200 people dead or missing in China this year and caused $25 billion in damage, authorities said last week.
Sichuan, through which the Yangtze river flows, raised its emergency response to the maximum level on Tuesday to cope with a new round of torrential rainfall.
The Yangtze water resources commission, the government body that oversees the river, declared a red alert late on Tuesday, saying water at some monitoring stations was expected to exceed “guaranteed” flood protection levels by more than 5 metres.
Water inflows at the Three Gorges project, a major hydroelectric facility designed in part to tame floods on the Yangtze, rose to a record 72,000 cubic meters (2.5 million cubic feet) per second on Wednesday, state media said. The inflow was expected to peak on Thursday at 76,000 cubic meters per second, the ministry of water resources said.
The project restricts the amount of water flowing downstream by storing it in its reservoir, which has beenmore than 10 metres higher than its official warning level for more than a month.
The facility was forced to raise water discharge volumes on Tuesday in order to “reduce flood control pressures“, the water ministry said.
Authorities have been at pains to show that the cascade of giant dams and reservoirs built along the Yangtze’s upper reaches have shielded the region from the worst of the floods this year, though critics say they might be making things worse.
The sprawling Yangtze river city of Chongqing saw its worst flooding since 1981. Water covered roofs in low-lying areas of the historic town of Ciqikou, which was closed to tourists because of the rains from Tuesday evening."

Damaging winds, dust storms and small bushfires have broken out across New South Wales and one person has been injured after scaffolding collapsed in Gosford during high winds.
A severe weather warning was issued for much of the NSW coastline on Wednesday, with gusts up to 90km/h predicted. In the state’s west, the wild winds whipped up dust storms near Wilcannia, Menindee and Broken Hill.
Nine small bushfires, all at advice level, had broken out across the state as of 4.30pm on Wednesday, according to the Rural Fire Service.
Fires broke out at Bucca Road at Bucca, Greberts Road at Whiteman Creek, the Pacific Highway at Duranbah, Providence Road at Kalang, Scone Road at Copeland, Sugarloaf Road at Bendolba and at the Valley Valley Trail in Nambucca.
The largest fire, at Duranbah in the Tweed Council, was 164 hectares in size and out of control at 4.30pm.
Hazard reduction burns were also conducted at the Copeton Dam recreation area and at the Forestry HRB Johns River Plantation.
Gale warnings were issued for the Macquarie coast, Hunter coast, Sydney coast, Illawarra coast and Batemans coast, while strong wind warnings were issued for the Byron coast, Coffs coast, Eden coast and Sydney closed waters.
In Gosford on the central coast, multiple cars were crushed and one person sustained head injuries after building scaffolding collapsed about 3pm.
Alex Majchrowski, a meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said that “much of the coastline” of the state would be hit by damaging winds.
“That is due to a vigorous cold front that is making its way through NSW at the moment,” he said. “There will be a couple more before the end of the week, so we can expect those windy conditions to continue.”
Winds would average 60 to 70km/h in affected areas, with gusts in excess of 90km/h.
Majchrowski also said the bureau had observed dust storms in western NSW but the dust “should ease by tomorrow”.
Residents should follow the advice of state emergency services, which includes moving vehicles under cover away from trees, the meteorologist said.
“It is important to know that trees that have been damaged by fire are more likely and more able to fall.”

California’s governor has declared a state of emergency as the state battles dozens of wildfires amid a historic heatwave.
“We are deploying every resource available to keep communities safe as California battles fires across the state during these extreme conditions,” said Gavin Newsom, the state governor, on Tuesday. “California and its federal and local partners are working in lockstep to meet the challenge and remain vigilant in the face of continued dangerous weather conditions.”
Fires of varying size are currently burning across the state including in Sonoma, San Mateo, Napa, Butte, Nevada and Monterey counties. Evacuations were in effect or growing in the Napa county wine country north of San Francisco Bay, near Salinas in Monterey county, around Oroville Dam north of Sacramento and near the Nevada state line north of Lake Tahoe.
Several fires had been sparked by lightening strikes during unusual thunderstorms prompted by the extreme heatwave, which has sent temperatures soaring into the triple digits.
One of the largest – the SCU Lightning Complex fire, comprised of fires burning in several Bay Area counties – has so far consumed 25,000 acres and remains 0% contained.
A fire in Napa county was burning close to remote grape-growing properties owned by Villa Del Lago Winery.
“Our vineyard workers had to evacuate very quickly. And we heard this morning that there was zero containment, so that’s scary. It’s very steep, so I know it’s hard for firefighters to get up there,” said Dawn Phillips, who works in customer service for the winery.
Firefighters toiled in oppressive heat as the fires burned, posing threats to homes, forcing evacuations and fouling the air with smoke far beyond the largely rural or wilderness areas where flames fed on very dry vegetation.
Michelle Leopold, co-owner of six Ace hardware stores in the San Francisco Bay Area, said she sold 56 wading pools, two air conditioning units and a number of generators Saturday. She said she’s grateful her employees have not contracted the coronavirus and her stores are even hiring.
“You look at the blessings in this crazy time because there’s not much else to look at,” she said, laughing.
In southern California, evacuations continued for a week-old fire in the mountains of northern Los Angeles county. Dynamic weather churned up thunderstorms bringing the double threat of more lightning-sparked fires and flash floods.
Meanwhile, California’s power grid operators are under pressure to avoid more power blackouts as an ongoing heat wave stresses the electrical system. Thousands lost electricity over the weekend as the system strained under high demand, a situation Newsom described as “unacceptable”.
The California Independent System Operator had warned Monday that as many as 3.3m homes and businesses would be affected by an evening emergency order that would have required utilities to stage rotating, two-hour outages. But the order never was issued and the warning was canceled.
Pleas for people to leave their air conditioners at higher temperatures and avoid using washing machines and other major appliances seemed to have worked. “Thank you for conserving,” California ISO said in a tweet.
However, grid managers warned that the threat of outages remained as temperatures were expected to hit triple digits again in many areas of the state. The National Weather Service said it may take until Friday or Saturday before excess heat watches and warnings ease.
Scorching weather has hit other western states, making it harder for California to import extra power.
“What we have is a situation where the entire region is more than hot, it’s extremely hot,” said Steve Berberich, California ISO’s president and CEO. “We can’t get the energy that we would normally get from out of state because it’s being used to serve loads natively. That would probably account for another 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts and could have very well have closed the gap.”
California ISO has struggled to reduce the electrical demand since last Friday, when it issued the first rolling blackouts in nearly 20 years. The three biggest utilities – Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric – turned off power to more than 410,000 homes and businesses for about an hour at a time. A second but shorter outage hit Saturday evening, affecting more than 200,000 customers.
Bonnie Wikler, 66, worried about her husband, who is recovering from open heart surgery. She said it was very stressful to lose power twice over the weekend at their home in Coalinga, a city in central California where temperatures reached 109F (43C).
They thought about driving somewhere but were too afraid of coronavirus exposure, so they stayed home and cooled off with ice water, she said.
“If there was a fire or an earthquake, I would understand, but to cut power without letting you know, it just seems outlandish to me,” Wikler said."

A huge wildfire has prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles, with firefighters hoping to rein in the blaze before temperatures spike later on Thursday.
The Lake fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon in dense forest land in the Lake Hughes area of the Angeles national forest, some 60 miles (97km) north of downtown Los Angeles.
The blaze exploded in size within hours on brushy ridges, including some areas that had not burned since 1968, fire officials said. By Thursday morning, the flames had consumed nearly 16.5 square miles (42 sq km) of timber and chaparral shrubland and an enormous plume of smoke was visible across much of southern California.
About 100 rural homes were evacuated in the Lake Hughes. Preliminary damage assessments found that at least three structures burned, though it was not immediately clear if they were houses.
There was no containment of the fire, but light winds and scattered thundershowers early on Thursday helped calm the flames.
The fire was being fed by tinder-dry brush in steep terrain, but its ferocity on Wednesday approached that of wind-driven blazes that usually erupt when gusty Santa Ana winds arrive later in the year, said the county deputy fire chief, David Richardson.
Officials were preparing for the possibility of extremely dangerous fires on Thursday as heat increases and humidity levels drop, fire officials said in a statement. The area was expected to have temperatures in the mid-90s (about 35C) or higher through the weekend.
Evacuation centers were designated for residents and animals, but because of Covid-19 concerns, people were told to stay in their cars in the parking lots of the centers."

Bushfire scientists call for Australia to set up national fire monitoring agency

A group of bushfire scientists have used an article in one of the world’s leading scientific journals to call for Australia to establish a national agency to monitor the scale, severity and impacts of fires.
The eight scientists from Australia and Spain say inconsistencies in how the scale and severity of bushfires are measured across the states had led to confusion over how much of the country actually burned.
Analysis of satellite data for the article, published in Nature, shows 18% or 7.5m hectares of the country’s eucalyptus forests burned – a figure 7.5 times higher than the average over the past 18 years of the satellite record, but about 600,000 hectares smaller than government data.
At a time when climate change was driving more frequent dangerous bushfires, the lack of a consistent approach meant “we’re navigating uncharted territory without a compass”, the authors wrote.
The scientists from the University of Tasmania, the University of Wollongong, the Australian National University and the University of Alcalá in Spain, said the ongoing royal commission into the bushfires should recommend a national fire monitoring agency be established.
Such an agency, the group writes, could agree a consistent approach to measuring the frequency, size and severity of fires, as well as investigating their causes, the greenhouse gas emissions they generate and the public health and economic issues they raised.
“The 2019–20 fires marked a historic crossroads. A national crisis of this magnitude, which will probably happen again, requires a national solution,” the authors conclude.
Their own analysis, using only satellite data, showed that 30.38m hectares had burned in the 2019 and 2020 fire season, across all types of land cover. This compared to a government estimate of 39.8m hectares.
Government records often included unburnt patches within a single perimeter, the scientists said, whereas satellite data was more consistent but was also prone to missing fires, particularly those less-severe burning under dense canopies.
“Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses,” the scientists write. “It will thus be crucial to monitor fires with a method that can produce internally consistent data at the national scale, and that can be repeated many times during a fire crisis.”
Without such a consistent approach, the scientists said it was more challenging to assess the environmental impacts of the fires and verify claims.
As many as 3bn animals have been estimated to have been in the path of the fires. Three ecologists concluded that the fires caused “the most dramatic loss of habitat for threatened species and devastation of ecological communities in postcolonial history”.
The lead author of the article, Prof David Bowman of the University of Tasmania, told Guardian Australia the purpose of the satellite analysis was to illustrate how the different approaches could deliver inconsistent results.
“In the eucalyptus forests, there’s no question these fires were unprecedented in the satellite record,” he said.
Dr Grant Williamson, a co-author of the article, also of the University of Tasmania, said he did not think the satellite data used for the article should be relied on either.
He said: “The satellite data can miss low-severity fires. If there’s a fire burning under a dense forest, the satellite can’t pick that up. We need a combination of approaches.”
Bowman told Guardian Australia a more careful record of Australia’s fire history was needed. For example, some official sources have stated that Victoria’s Black Thursday fires of 1851 had burned across 5m hectares of the state, but don’t define what was burned.
A reference used for those reports says only 1.5m hectares of forest burned that year, with the rest being scrub and grasslands.
Adjunct Prof Jim McLennan, a bushfire safety expert at La Trobe University, who was not an author of the article, said he supported the proposals for a national approach.
He said: “Historically, response to natural hazard emergencies, and associated data collection, has been a matter for individual states and territories.
“However, future increases in hazard frequency and severity, driven by global warming, mean that weather-related hazards require a national response capability, and the basis for this must be an appropriate national database.”
Also commenting on the proposals, Dr Michael-Shawn Fletcher, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne, said a nationally consistent approach was “crucial for guiding efforts at mitigation and post-fire response”.
He said satellite imagery was useful for tracking fires in the more open tropical savanna in the country’s north, “but these systems are very different to the temperate eucalypt forests that, arguably, present the greatest risk for Australia’s firey future.”
He also cautioned against moving away from independent assessments of fire area, severity and impacts in favour of a national approach. He added: “Finally, it could be argued that the solution needs to reach beyond a simple national monitoring agency, to an independent and nationally-coordinated agency aimed at informing government about prediction, mitigation and monitoring of fire in Australia.”"

First published on Wed 12 Aug 2020 01.03 BST
Hundreds of thousands across the midwest remained without electricity on Tuesday after a powerful storm packing 100mph winds battered the region a day earlier, causing widespread damage to millions of acres of crops and killing at least two people.
The storm, known as a derecho, tore from eastern Nebraska across Iowa and parts of Wisconsin and Illinois, blowing over trees, flipping vehicles and causing widespread damage to property and crops. The storm left downed trees and power lines that blocked roadways in Chicago and its suburbs. After leaving Chicago, the most potent part of the storm system moved over north central Indiana.
The storm also did major damage to agriculture. In Iowa, the governor, Kim Reynolds, said early estimates indicated 10m acres had been damaged in the nation’s top corn producing state, nearly a third of the roughly 31macres used for crops in the state. The most significant damage is to the corn crop. 
“This morning I had a farmer reach out to me to say this was the worst wind damage to crops and farm buildings that he has ever seen across the state in such a wide area,” Reynolds said.
“It’s incredibly devastating to see what’s happening to crops, and to structures all across the storm path,” said Mike Naig, Iowa’s agriculture secretary.
Naig said tens of millions of bushels worth of commercial grain storage and millions of bushels of on-farm grain storage had been damaged or destroyed.
Roger Zylstra, who has farmed in central Iowa near Kellogg since 1980, said four of his hog barns had lost their roofs, two of his machine sheds had suffered significant damage and many of his corn acres had been destroyed. Zylstra, 69, said crop insurance would help but that the financial hit would be devastating for many farmers.
“The question remains for all of us is: what happens in the next five or six weeks? How much can we salvage out of these fields?” Zylstra said. “I know that some people won’t survive this.”
In Fort Wayne, Indiana, Isabel E Atencio died at a hospital after firefighters pulled her from debris inside her mobile home after high winds rolled it on to its side on Monday night, officials said. Firefighters found the 73-year-old woman under debris inside her toppled trailer and discovered that she was clutching a five-year-old boy believed to be her grandson, authorities said. The boy had minor injuries.
A derecho is not quite a hurricane. It has no eye, and its winds come across in a line. But its damage is more like an inland hurricane than a quick more powerful tornado, according to Patrick Marsh, the science support chief at the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.
The storm began as separate thunderstorms in South Dakota before strengthening over Iowa; by the time the system reached Des Moines, wind gusts were clocked at more than 100mph, according to climatologists.
Iowa officials reported roofs torn off homes and buildings, vehicles blown off roads and hit by trees, and people hurt by flying debris. One death and dozens of injuries were reported in the state.
Thomas Rowland a 63-year-old bicyclist, died after he was struck by one of several large trees that fell Monday on a bike trail outside Cedar Rapids. 
Utility officials in Iowa said it would probably take several days to restore power to everyone. Nearly 340,000 Iowa customers of MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy remained without power on Tuesday afternoon. Another 33,000 in the Illinois Quad Cities region also lacked power.
Power and internet outages were widespread in Iowa’s three largest metropolitan areas: Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport. The power outages were so extensive that at one point Monday, 97% of households in Linn county, which includes Cedar Rapids, were in the dark, Reynolds said."

Hundreds of residents on the New South Wales south coast are waiting for the all-clear to return home as river levels fall and flooding eases after heavy rain and wild weather.
After three days of damaging surf battering the state, a marine wind warning remains in place on Tuesday on the Byron, Coffs and Macquarie coasts in the north.
In the south, waves exceeding 5 metres on the Illawarra, Sydney, Hunter and mid-north coasts on Monday threatened to cause further erosion.
The State Emergency Service says the Shoalhaven River at Nowra on the south coast, which peaked at 4.13 metres on Monday, is now falling with minor flooding. Evacuation orders remain in place in many south coast areas and the SES will be on duty in the Shoalhaven region to help residents in Sussex Inlet and Nowra clean up.
Endeavour Energy said its crews were working to restore 270 homes and businesses still left without power after Sunday night’s storm. At its height, more than 13,500 customers were without electricity supply due to the widespread damage caused by the strong winds and torrential rain.
While repairs continued late on Monday night to get power back to customers where possible, flooding in parts of the southern highlands, Shoalhaven and Hawkesbury regions hampered access to all fault sites. Crews will return to those areas on Tuesday morning to complete repairs and safely restore power to customers.
While flooding has subsided, roads are still waterlogged and drivers are warned to proceed with caution.
The SES attended 274 jobs across the state since Friday and 800 volunteers helped stranded drivers and homeowners, with 41 flood rescues. A spokeswoman said crews would need to ensure conditions were safe before giving the all-clear for evacuees to return to their homes.
“When that happens really depends on what the crews find in the river,” she said on Tuesday.
She urged people to return with caution, bring fresh water with them and be aware that flood waters could be contaminated with sewage, chemicals and debris.
“They need to make sure they don’t use personal items like kitchen utensils or personal items like toothbrushes that have been contaminated by flood waters,” she said."

The body of a man missing after a storm sparked flash floods on the Greek island of Evia over the weekend has been recovered, Greece’s coastguard has said, bringing the death toll from the storm to eight.
Rescue crews had been searching for the 72-year-old since Sunday when he was reported missing after flooding swept away cars and sent residents of some villages scrambling to their roofs to await rescue.
The coastguard said the man’s body was recovered from the sea off the coast of mainland Greece opposite Evia shortly after midday on Monday.
The dead from the storm and flash floods included an elderly couple discovered in their flooded home Sunday morning, and an eight-month-old baby found in a flooded ground-floor apartment.
Rainfall in parts of Evia reached 80% of the annual total for the area in the space of a few hours overnight from Saturday to Sunday, Greece’s meteorological service said.
A river burst through its banks and flooded part of the village of Politika, forcing many residents to climb to the rooftops of their homes. Another river in the village of Bourtzi also burst its banks.
Authorities estimated that 3,000 residences had been partially or totally damaged by floodwaters, and police said many roads were impassable. Power and water were knocked out in some areas.
The floods swept away cars and storage containers, tossing them into streets and against the walls of buildings. On Monday, local authorities, emergency crews and residents were clearing debris and piles of mud from streets, homes and stores.
Heavy rain started falling at about midnight on Saturday and firefighters responded to more than 50 fires caused by lightning. By late afternoon on Sunday, 97 people had been safely evacuated from their homes and cars, 30 of them by helicopter, and more than 600 homes had been drained of floodwaters, the fire service said."

Seven people have died, including a baby, as torrential rains and floods swept the Greek island of Evia, damaging dozens of houses and blocking roads.
The eight-month-old baby was found dead in a house in the village of Politika on Sunday, said a spokesman for firefighters involved in rescue efforts. The baby’s parents were unharmed.
Hours earlier, a man and woman in their 80s were found unconscious by firefighters in two houses in the same village, the spokesman said. They were later confirmed at a hospital.
Two other people who died, a 74-year-old man and a 73-year-old woman, were from the village of Bourtsi, the ANA news agency reported.
The five dead were among an earlier official toll, which also listed one person as missing, following torrential rains late Saturday and early Sunday.
Firefighters later said two more people had died but gave no detail. One person remained missing.
One woman was found after being reported missing.
The ANA news agency said a helicopter had spotted the missing woman, who had been swept away by the floodwaters from her home in Bourtsi.
Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, voiced his “profound pain for the loss of lives” and said he would visit Evia, Greece‘s second largest island after Crete, on Monday.
Torrents of water blocked roads in the west of Evia, which lies about 60 miles (100km) north-east of Athens. Some tourists were unable to leave one campsite on the island, ANA reported.
“We are experiencing a nightmare, we are using every possible means” to combat the floods, said Ana Fanis Spanos, a lawmaker from the central Greece region.
Storm Thalia battered several regions of mainland Greece Saturday, though the weather improved on Sunday.
Hundreds of homes were flooded in Politika and several surrounding villages. Blocked roads prevented fire trucks from reaching the affected sites.
Two rivers burst their banks and filled roads with mud, local authorities said. The ground floors of many houses were flooded.
Manos Anastasiou, a hotel employee in Politika, said he was astonished at the amount of rain. 
“I’m 51 years old and it’s the first time I have seen something like this,” Anastasiou said.
About 100 firefighters and two helicopters as well as the coastguard were deployed to rescue those trapped.
Deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias, who visited Politika Sunday morning, said more than 13.8in (350mm) of rain fell in six hours."

A surfer has died in Sydney amid wild weather that led to the evacuation of towns across New South Wales at the weekend. NSW police have confirmed that at 12.45pm on Monday witnesses pulled an unconscious surfer from the water at Collaroy, on Sydney’s northern beaches.
CPR was performed on the 44-year-old man until emergency services arrived. He was taken to Royal North Shore hospital but later died.
It comes as the state’s south coast remains on high alert after the deluge at the weekend.
Although conditions eased on Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of damaging winds and surf across the state after more than 300mm of rain fell across some parts.
The NSW State Emergency Service issued evacuation warnings on Sunday after receiving about 1,600 calls over the weekend, most on the south coast and across greater Sydney.
“Fortunately only one family has had to be found emergency accommodation,” the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Monday.
“Everybody else who’s asked to be evacuated has managed to find accommodation on their own.”
The body of a kayaker was found in swollen river waters in southern Canberra on Sunday. He became separated from a group on the Murrumbidgee River near Canberra about 2pm after his boat became stuck under a bridge.
Water police, search and rescue teams and the ACT State Emergency Service were called in but he was found unresponsive in the water after four hours.

By Monday morning, flooding at the Moruya river was minor but flooding from the Shoalhaven river at Nowra and Terara was forecast, with the river expected to peak at 4.4m about 1pm.
“It has been a very wet and wild few days up and down the south coast and there is a considerable amount of water lying around in general,” the NSW SES deputy commissioner, Daniel Austin, told ABC News Breakfast.
“We saw some really intense rain bursts over the weekend and that just dragged on and dragged on for longer than was probably expected.”

The SES said it would also focus on Shoalhaven Heads on Monday, where more winds and damaging surf conditions were expected along the coast.
Many of the communities hit by the deluge are still recovering from the devastating summer bushfires that ravaged the state’s south. On Monday the Bega MP Andrew Constance told Sydney radio station 2GB that it had been a “nerve-racking” weekend.
“We’ve gone fires, Covid, recession, we had a Covid outbreak and now these very heavy rains,” he said.
“We have quite a lot of fire victims who live west of the Princes highway and will be cut off for a few of days.”
In Sydney, the Manly fast ferries were cancelled on Monday morning because of large swells.
The SES issued three evacuation orders late on Sunday after up to 200mm of rain hit a number of towns including Moruya, Nowra and inland at Captains Flat over the 24 hours to Sunday evening, with up to 300mm in isolated areas.
Police again urged the public not to enter or play in flood waters or swollen rivers.
Major flooding occurred along the Deua river, which peaked at 8m on Sunday at Wamban.

The SES ordered residents in Moruya’s CBD, Sussex Inlet and Nowra suburbs including Terara, East Nowra, Worrigee and North Nowra to evacuate to higher ground.
People in low-lying areas of Sussex Inlet were told flood levels were expected to affect properties.
Sussex Inlet was forecast to rise to 1.2m with the high tide on Sunday night, and the nearby river at Island Point Road was expected to cause minor flooding.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NoaaA) has predicted an “extremely active” hurricane season in the US in an already record-breaking year for storms.
Noaa’s Climate Prediction Center said there could be up to 25 storms which have sustained winds of 39mph or greater. Storms which hit this threshold are named by the agency.
In a normal year, there are usually two storms before August which are named.
This year, there have already been nine named storms, a record which makes 2020’s hurricane season one of the busiest on record in the US.
Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at the Climate Prediction Center, said the combined intensity and duration of all storms during the season is predicted to be much higher than the threshold for an “extremely active” season.
“We’ve never forecast up to 25 storms,” Bell said in a press briefing. “So this is the first time.”
The previous high was in 2005, when the agency predicted a maximum of 21 named storms.
Of the 25 possible named storms, Noaa estimates seven to 11 could become hurricanes, which have winds of at least 74mph. The agency also forecast that three to six storms could become major hurricanes, with winds of 111mph or more.
The hurricane season ends on 30 November. Noaa said there is an 85% chance it will be an above-active season, an increase from the May prediction.
“This year, we expect more, stronger, and longer-lived storms than average,” Bell said in a statement.
The NoaaA forecast does not predict which of the hurricanes will make landfall, because those predictions rely mostly on short-term weather patterns.
The increase in predicted hurricanes is attributed to warmer than usual sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, combined with the wind conditions.
There is also growing evidence that warming in the atmosphere and upper ocean, caused by human activity, is creating conditions more suitable for more destructive hurricanes.
Residents in areas more vulnerable to hurricanes have been encouraged to review their preparation plans for a possible storm, and to account for the effects of Covid-19 in that plan.
This week, when Hurricane Isaias was heading towards South Carolina, health officials there advised people to add face masks and cleaning products to their preparations kits because of the virus.
Officials also encouraged people who may need to evacuate to find hotels to go to, or family and friends to stay with, to avoid staying at a shelter, where socially distancing would be in place but is still an environment where the coronavirus could spread more easily."

",,"India’s commercial capital grinds to a halt after heaviest August rainfall in 47 years causes widespread flooding

The heaviest monsoon downpour in nearly 50 years has brought Mumbai to a standstill, with stranded passengers at railway stations having to be rescued by dinghies from waist-high water.
People who live in areas normally unaffected by the annual monsoon flooding looked out from their high-rise flats at new swirling rivers outside caused by the heaviest single day’s rain recorded in August in 47 years.
Wednesday saw extraordinary downpours and winds of more than 100km/h tossing cars aside, uprooting trees, tearing down hoardings and smashing cranes at the port.
Even on Marine Drive, the famous arc-shaped boulevard that runs alongside the Arabian Sea and is lined with art deco buildings, the relentless rain caused flooding. This area is normally not affected by torrential monsoon rain as the drainage system usually works better than in low-lying areas of the city that are usually worst-hit.
Other areas where the elite live – Fort, Colaba, Churchgate, Breach Candy and Pedder Road – and where many heritage buildings are located, were also flooded. 
 So far India’s commercial capital has been inundated with 2,319mm of rain. The annual average is 2,260mm.
“Every year we suffer from flooding, every year it’s the same nightmare but this is altogether different. I saw coconuts flying off in the air and smashing into car windows,” said Reshma Patil who lives on the 10th floor of an apartment block on Peddar Road.
Her neighbour said he saw signposts and huge metal sheets from a nearby construction site flying past his window.
Waterlogged roads, fallen trees and abandoned cars have added to the usual traffic mayhem in this city of 12 million people where approximately 60% of the population live in slums. Train and bus services have been suspended and many flights cancelled.
People who are stranded and unable to go home have been put up inside schools that have been turned into temporary shelters.
Every year monsoon rains bring the city to a halt and expose its crumbling infrastructure. Every year the city authorities promise to clear the Victorian-era drainage system of silt and debris before the monsoon hits but the same deluge happens, disrupting normal life for weeks.
The flooding is yet another battle for residents overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mumbai is the worst-affected city in the country. Infections have been rising across the India since March, with around 1.8 million infections and close to 40,000 deaths.
A survey last month showed that more than half the people who live in its sprawling slums had been infected with the virus."

Fourteen people have been killed and more than 1,000 forced from their homes as 42 consecutive days of rain, South Korea’s longest monsoon in seven years, triggered floods and landslides.
Heavy rain, which has also battered China, Thailand, Myanmar and India, inundated farmland and flooded parts of major highways and bridges in the capital, Seoul.
The victims included three New Zealanders from the same family, who were found dead on Monday after a landslide hit holiday cottages in Gapyeong county, north-east of the city.
The New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Korea identified the victims as the organisation’s director, Anna Song, her young son, and her mother, Rose Kim.
Song had been involved in “all activities to promote the New Zealand and Korea relationship”, the chamber said.
The New Zealand foreign ministry said it was aware of the deaths and was providing consular assistance. It did not elaborate.
Among the other deaths caused by the rain were three workers killed when a landslide struck the factory where they were working.
President Moon Jae-in expressed concern about the impact of 42 days of rain, which weather officials said was the longest such stretch since 2013, on public sector emergency workers already battling the Covid-19 pandemic.
He urged “all-out efforts to prevent further loss of life”, such as action to avert landslides and evacuate people, even in cases of little apparent danger.
Most of the flooded roads and bridges along the Han River in Seoul that had backed up traffic and damaged infrastructure were back in operation on Tuesday, the Yonhap news agency said.
In neighbouring North Korea, state media warned of possible flooding.
“All the sectors of the national economy .. are taking steps to prevent damage from the downpour,” the state news agency KCNA said, adding that some areas were predicted to receive as much as half a metre of rain.
Citing unidentified South Korean government officials, Yonhap said North Korea had opened the floodgates of a border dam on Monday without advance notice to its neighbour. "

At least four people were killed as Tropical Storm Isaias spawned tornadoes and dumped rain Tuesday along the US east coast after making landfall as a hurricane in North Carolina, where it caused floods and fires that displaced dozens of people.
Two people died when Isaias spun off a tornado that struck a North Carolina mobile home park. Authorities said two others were killed by falling trees toppled by the storm in Maryland and New York City.
More than 15 hours after coming ashore, Isaias still had sustained top winds of 65mph. Mid-Tuesday afternoon, the storm’s center was about 65 miles west of New York City, where winds forced the Staten Island ferry and outdoor subway lines to shut down.
Forecasters said it would continue to inflict damage while moving into New England by late Tuesday.
New York City mayor Bill de Blasio issued a tornado watch through 4pm after the hurricane center reported numerous storms throughout the mid-Atlantic region, and by 1pm strong winds and rain were lashing New York.
Social media images showed tornadoes in Cape May, Marmora and Long Beach Island along New Jersey’s southern shore, as well as tornado damage in Dover, Delaware.
A tropical storm warning remained in effect from North Carolina to Maine.
Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina spoke of “double trouble” on ABC on Tuesday morning as he described the state trying to evacuate and rescue people as the hurricane hit while also trying to minimize the risk of spreading coronavirus.
The state had to provide more shelters, at least two dozen opening, so those having to leave their homes because of flooding or fire caused by power outages, could try to keep socially distant, while having temperature checks and wearing masks.
Cooper urged those evacuating to turn to shelters as a last resort, citing coronavirus risks and the need to operate shelters at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing. “Whether it’s labeled a tropical storm or a hurricane, you should take this storm seriously, and make sure your family is ready,” he said.
“All in all this storm got in and got out pretty quickly,” he told ABC’s Good Morning America on Tuesday. He added: “We are saddened by the one fatality we know we have.”
The death occurred at a mobile home park, where structures were torn apart and cars blown on top of each other, and there were several people still missing on Tuesday afternoon.
At least three states are under a federal emergency declaration.
“We don’t think there is going to be a whole lot of weakening, we still think there’s going to be very strong and gusty winds that will affect much of the mid-Atlantic and the north-east over the next day or two,” said Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.
Forecasters had warned tornadoes were possible, and two were later confirmed, near Kilmarnock, Virginia, and Vienna, Maryland. 
More than 600,000 customers lost electricity, most of them in North Carolina and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.US, which tracks utility reports.
In Suffolk, Virginia, near the coast, multiple homes were damaged by falling trees, and city officials received reports of a possible tornado. A fire station downtown sustained damage including broken windows. A photo posted by city officials showed a pile of bricks lying next to a damaged business.
The storm set off flooding and sparked five home fires in Ocean Isle Beach, Mayor Debbie Smith told WECT-TV. The town’s firefighters were battling the blaze with help from Horry county firefighters in South Carolina, Tony Casey, a spokesperson for Horry County Fire Rescue, told the Associated Press.
About 80 miles north of Ocean Isle Beach, about 30 people were displaced due to a fire at a condominium complex in Surf City, news outlets reported.
It is not clear if the fires were connected to the storm. No injuries have been reported.
Isaias toggled between tropical storm and hurricane strength throughout its path to the US coast, killing two people in the Caribbean and trashing the Bahamas before brushing past Florida.
Coastal shops and restaurants had closed early in the Carolinas, where power began to flicker at oceanfront hotels and even the most adventurous of beachgoers abandoned the sand on Monday night. The National Hurricane Center warned oceanside home dwellers to brace for storm surge up to 5ft (1.5 meters) and up to 8in (20cm) of rain in spots.
As the storm neared the shore, a gauge on a pier in Myrtle Beach recorded its third-highest water level since it was set up in 1976. Only Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 pushed more salt water inland."

The Apple fire in mountains east of Los Angeles that has forced thousands of people from their homes was sparked by a malfunctioning diesel vehicle, fire officials said Monday.
The vehicle spewed burning carbon from its exhaust system, igniting several fires Friday and authorities were asking anyone who may have seen such a vehicle at the time to contact investigators, according to a statement from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The blaze in Riverside county, among several wildfires across California, had consumed nearly 42 sq miles (more than 108 sq km) of dry brush and chaparral since it broke out Friday evening, fire officials said.
As of Monday night, it was just 7% contained and the fire along with coronavirus precautions made for added stress at an evacuation center, said John Medina, an American Red Cross spokesman.
Volunteers used to “close contact” with evacuees have had to adjust their approach during a time of social distancing, Medina said.
“I mean, that’s part of the recovery of a disaster, is that you have to show warmth and love and caring. And that’s hard when you’re standing 6ft away. So that’s the biggest challenge,” Medina told KESQ-TV.
Bill Boehm helped his mother evacuate her home with her three horses and said the pandemic hasn’t stopped people from coming together to assist each other. “Everyone seemed to be wearing masks and such, so that type of precaution was still going on,” Boehm told the news station.
The blaze began as two adjacent fires in a rural area near the city of Beaumont, about 85 miles (137km) east of downtown Los Angeles.
Flames raced along brushy ridge tops and came close to houses while firefighters attacked from the ground and air. By nightfall, the flames were burning into the San Gorgonio Wilderness, where the brush was becoming sparse and limited the fire’s intensity, according to Zach Behrens, a spokesman for the San Bernardino national forest.
Five buildings had been destroyed, including at least one home, authorities said. One firefighter was treated for an injury and returned to work.
Evacuation orders and advisories were issued for about 2,500 homes in mountain, canyon and foothill neighborhoods. Campgrounds and hiking trails were closed in the San Gorgonio wilderness area of the San Bernardino national forest.
A smoke plume was visible for miles around and contributed to poor air quality. Firefighters fought the blaze in scorching weather. The temperature hit 111F (44C) on Monday in nearby Palm Springs.
In northern California, evacuations were ordered after a wildfire that sparked Sunday afternoon spread quickly and burned near homes near the East Park reservoir in Colusa county. Complicating firefighters’ efforts were temperatures in the area north of Sacramento climbed to 98F (37C) by Monday afternoon. The fire was 40% contained.
On California’s central coast, a fire in San Luis Obispo county was 60% contained Monday after burning more than 2 sq miles (6 sq km) of brush east of the community of Santa Margarita. Two structures were destroyed but officials said it was unclear whether they were homes."

First published on Mon 3 Aug 2020 13.51 BST
Hurricane Isaias has been downgraded down to a tropical storm after making landfall near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina.
The hurricane touched down shortly after 11pm on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (136km/h), weakening to 70 miles per hour (117km/h).
“Now that the center has moved further inland into east North Carolina, the winds are now coming back down, so it has been downgraded back to a tropical storm,” Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, told the Associated Press.
The center had warned oceanside residents to brace for a storm surge of up to 5ft (1.5 meters) and up to 8 inches (20cm) of rain in spots as Isaias continued its march up the US east coast.
Coastal residents secured patio furniture, ferry operators completed evacuations on the Outer Banks, and officials passed out sandbags and offered car space in elevated garages.
The Carolinas are not the only states at risk, with Isaias likely to bring further heavy rains of up to eight inches in spots as it moves north.
“All those rains could produce flash-flooding across portions of the eastern Carolinas and mid-Atlantic, and even in the north-east US,” said Daniel Brown, a senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center.
A tropical storm warning extended all the way up to Maine, where flash flooding was possible in some areas on Wednesday.
Donald Trump on Monday described Isaias as “very serious”, saying people should “remain vigilant until it passes”.
Over the weekend, Isaias brought heavy rain and flooding to Florida as officials kept a close eye on the storm while dealing with surging cases of the coronavirus.
The storm had weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm on Saturday afternoon, and its most damaging winds remained offshore.
“Don’t be fooled by the downgrade,” the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, warned at a news conference after the storm spent hours battering the Bahamas.
DeSantis said that with Florida entering the season’s most active time for hurricanes, residents should have a week’s supply of water, food and medicine on hand.
Upper-level winds later sapped much of the storm’s strength, said Stacy Stewart, senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center in Miami.
“We were expecting a hurricane to develop and it didn’t,” Stewart said Sunday. “It’s a tale of two storms. If you live on the west side of the storm, you didn’t get much. If you live east of the storm, there’s a lot of nasty weather there.”
Isaias caused destruction and two deaths as it uprooted trees, destroyed crops and homes and caused widespread flooding and small landslides in the Dominican Republic and the US territory of Puerto Rico.
One man died in the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the national guard rescued at least 35 people from floods that swept away one woman, whose body was recovered Saturday.
Isaias then snapped trees and knocked out power as it blew through the Bahamas on Saturday. Officials in the Bahamas opened shelters for people in Abaco island to help those who have been living in temporary structures since Dorian devastated the area, killing at least 70 people in September 2019.
Authorities closed Florida beaches, parks and virus testing sites, lashing signs to palm trees to stop them blowing them away. Officials also adapted their shelter policies to the pandemic, providing spaces where people could stay safely apart from each other to prevent the spread of the virus.
In Palm Beach county, about 150 people were in shelters, wearing masks, said emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda.
The county has a voluntary evacuation order for those living in mobile or manufactured homes, or those who feel their home cannot withstand strong winds.
In Indian River county, north of West Palm Beach, Florida, emergency shelters were clearing out Sunday after Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm.
Officials told TCPalm newspapers that 38 people registered at three schools used as shelters. Those areas now must be cleaned to ensure no traces of the coronavirus remain as teachers and staff report Monday to prepare for the upcoming school year.
No one checked in with Covid-19 symptoms. Temperature checks were done at the door, officials said, and isolation rooms were designated in case anyone came in with symptoms."

Thousands of people were under evacuation orders Sunday after a wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles exploded in size as crews battled the flames in triple-digit heat.
The fire, dubbed the Apple Fire by local firefighters, was straddling Riverside and San Bernardino counties and consumed more than 23sq miles (about 60sq km) of dry brush and timber, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
There was zero containment early Sunday. The cause is under investigation.
The blaze began as two adjacent fires reported Friday evening in Cherry Valley, an unincorporated area near the city of Beaumont about 85 miles (137km) east of downtown Los Angeles.
Flames leapt along brushy ridge tops and came close to homes while firefighters attacked it from the ground and air.
One home and two outbuildings were destroyed, Cal Fire said. No injuries were reported.
Nearly 8,000 residents of Riverside county were told to evacuate their homes on Saturday, the County fire department said. Evacuation orders and advisories were issued for mountain, canyon and foothill neighborhoods. Campgrounds and hiking trails were closed in the San Gorgonio Wilderness area of the San Bernardino National Forest.
A huge smoke plume was visible for miles around and contributed to poor air quality. The mercury hit 105F (41C) Saturday in nearby Palm Springs. The National Weather Service said “dangerously hot conditions” were expected to continue because of high pressure over much of southern California. "

The astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, has decoupled from the space station ahead of an expected splashdown off the coast of Pensacola, Florida at 2:42 pm ET on Sunday (6:42pm UK GMT).
“It’s been a great two months, and we appreciate all you’ve done as a crew to help us prove out Dragon on its maiden flight,” Hurley told the remaining US station crew member Chris Cassidy, as Crew Dragon eased away from its docking port to begin the 21-hour journey home.
Their mission, named Demo-2, also marked the first time Nasa launched astronauts from US soil in nine years.
The last time astronauts made an ocean landing was on July 1975 during an Apollo mission.
Since then, spacemen have always landed on terra firma, using Nasa’s space shuttle or the Russian space agency’s Soyuz capsules.
If all goes to plan, the splashdown will usher in a new era for Nasa, which will have at least one commercial spacecraft ready to launch astronauts into space from US soil.
The splashdown is the final step in the mission designed to test SpaceX’s human spaceflight system – including launch, docking, splashdown, and recovery operations.
In a post-launch conference back in May, Elon Musk – who is the founder of SpaceX – said was was not keen to “declare victory yet”, emphasising that the “return can be more dangerous than the ascent”.
Musk said at that time: “We need to bring them home safely and make sure that we are doing everything we can to minimise that risk of re-entry.”
Shortly after undocking, the Crew Dragon perform will perform several manoeuvres that will lower the capsule’s orbit and get it closer to the splashdown zone.
The spacecraft will then perform another manoeuvre, known as deorbit burn, which will place it on a trajectory for splashdown, travelling at a speed of approximately 17,500 miles per hour.
On entering the Earth’s atmosphere, the Crew Dragon will face scorching temperatures of around 1,900C as it deploys parachutes to slow its speed down to around 119 miles per hour, before landing on the ocean.
The re-entry will create a communications blackout between the spacecraft and Earth that is expected to last approximately six minutes, Nasa said.
Two SpaceX recovery ships, the Go Searcher and the Go Navigator, made up of spacecraft engineers, recovery experts and medical professionals, will be waiting to pull the capsule on board and help the astronauts get out as they begin readjusting to gravity.
The aerospace company’s first operational flight is expected to take place in September, when a second Crew Dragon spacecraft will carry four astronauts to the space station."

First published on Sat 1 Aug 2020 14.54 BST
Hurricane Isaias ripped shingles off roofs and blew over trees as it carved its way through the Bahamas early on Saturday and headed toward the Florida coast, where officials in Miami said they were closing beaches, marinas and parks.
Miami’s mayor, Carlos Giménez, said on Friday that 20 evacuation centers were on standby that could be set up with Covid-19 safety measures.
“We still don’t think there is a need to open shelters for this storm, but they are ready,” he said.
The mayor said that social-distancing measures prompted by Covid-19 meant each person in shelters needed to have 40 sq ft (3.7 sq meters) and no more cafeteria-style dining would be allowed. People who are infected with the virus and need to evacuate will be isolated in classrooms separate from the general population, Giménez said.
Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, said on Saturday that 12 counties had adopted states of emergency, although no immediate evacuation orders had been given. He also said that hospitals were not being evacuated of coronavirus or other patients.
The Republican told a morning news conference that the state was prepared with stockpiles of personal protective equipment, generators, bottled water and meals ready to be distributed. He urged people to have seven days of food, water and medication on hand and said state-run coronavirus testing sites in the areas where the storm could hit would be closed.
The pandemic forced officials to wrestle with social-distancing rules at the same time as disaster response.
For example, in Marion county, Florida, officials said people would be provided facial coverings if they had to go to shelters. The facilities would have sanitizers and personal protective equipment if needed, although officials would prefer people bring their own PPE.
Kevin Shelton, the owner of Causeway Mowers in Indian Harbour Beach, Florida, said his store had been packed since Friday. People streamed in to buy generators, chainsaws and other provisions. On Saturday morning, Shelton and his wife served at least 25 customers an hour, which is double the business they would normally do on a weekend.
“They’re not saying much about Covid, they’re just making sure they have the proper supplies,” he said. “We’ve been in the area almost 50 years. We keep an eye on every storm. Every time we have a storm we take it seriously. It could shift in this direction at any moment.”
Authorities in North Carolina ordered the evacuation of Ocracoke island, which was hit by last year’s Hurricane Dorian, starting Saturday evening. Meanwhile, officials in the Bahamas evacuated people on Abaco island, who have been living in temporary structures since Dorian. People living in the eastern end of Grand Bahama were also being moved.
Isaias had maximum sustained winds of 85mph (135kph) on Saturday morning and some strengthening was possible later Saturday, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm was centered about 80 miles (125km) south-south-east of Nassau in the Bahamas and was moving north-west at 12mph (19kph). Forecasters said some decrease in its forward motion was expected.
Paula Miller, Mercy Corps director for the Bahamas, told the Associated Press that while the islands can normally withstand strong hurricanes, some have been destabilized by the coronavirus pandemic and the damage caused by Dorian.
“With everything not quite shored up, property not secured, home not prepared, even a category 1 will be enough to set them back,” she said.
A hurricane warning was in effect for north-west and central Bahamas.
“Continue to hunker down,” said Trevor Basden, director of the Bahamas meteorology department.
Two of those islands, Abaco and Grand Bahama, were battered by Dorian, a category 5 storm that hovered over the area for two days and killed at least 70 people, with more than 280 reported missing. People are still living in tents on both islands, and officials said crews tried to remove leftover debris ahead of Isaias.
Prime Minister Hubert Minnis relaxed a coronavirus lockdown as a result of the storm, but imposed a 10pm to 5am curfew. He said supermarkets, pharmacies, gas stations and hardware stores would be open as long as weather permitted.
The Bahamas has reported more than 570 confirmed Covid-19 cases and at least 14 deaths. It recently barred travelers from the US following a surge in cases after it reopened to international tourism."
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/31/texas-coronavirus-pandemic-hurricane-covid-19,'You need to pay attention': virus-hit Texas readies for hurricane threat,,"Covid-19 has complicated state’s preparedness – and experts are worried about the impact on a vulnerable population
On a recent weekend in Houston hundreds of people thronged a local Home Depot, buying plywood, bags of sand and gallons of water. They were getting supplies – not for a quarantine DIY project – but rather purchasing materials to protect their homes during hurricane season.
It is a yearly ritual in Texas, but 2020 is different. Not only is America facing an unusually active hurricane season – Texas has been hit once already – but the coronavirus pandemic looms over the state’s preparations, and effectively means its citizens are preparing for one natural disaster in the middle of another.
The Texas state climatologist, Dr John Nielsen-Gammon, says the 2020 hurricane season is expected to be more active than normal. Hurricane Hanna has already hit South Padre island, and Gonzalo threatened its shores before unexpectedly breaking up.
Nielsen-Gammon said: “The main problem with Hanna is going to be inland flooding from heavy rainfall. There’s lots of places in the lower Rio Grande Valley that have already received a foot of precipitation and that’s expected to continue for several more hours. This is a place where millions of people live.”
The threat of a hurricane in the area is now compounded by Covid-19, which has had a disproportionate impact on Texas’s communities of color.
Corpus Christi, a coastal city, saw the worst effects of Hanna, as well as the worst effects from the coronavirus in the state. In mid-July, it was confirmed that 85 infants had tested positive for the virus since March.
Nielsen-Gammon said: “Covid-19 definitely presents a challenge. You can still take people into shelters but you need good ventilation and to enforce social distancing.”
In a press conference addressing Hanna, Governor Greg Abbott said: “It is sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for Covid-19.”
In 2017, Houston was affected worst by Hurricane Harvey. The massive storm left many Houstonians dead, stranded, or forced to rebuild their homes. If an event like that were to happen again, the virus could make it much worse. Large, populous cities like Houston, whose greater metro area has a population of about 7 million, could find it more difficult to enforce social distancing once shelters become crowded.
“The only saving grace of the pandemic is that people are traveling less than normal so there are a greater number of open rooms in hotels and motels,” Nielsen-Gammon said. “That allows public officials to allocate rooms and lodging to people who don’t have the means, so it increases our shelter capacity.”
Beyond evacuation and sheltering during a natural disaster, Texans also have to prepare for what a hurricane leaves behind. Paulo Pires is an insurance agent in Houston and works with the National Flood Insurance Program under Fema. He is encouraging Texas homeowners to purchase flood insurance.
In a video for Fema, Pires said: “Just one inch of water can cause up to $25,000 of damage to your home.”
While Pires is a fervent supporter of flood insurance, he understands it’s an added cost many people cannot justify, especially since 3 million Texans have filed for unemployment relief since mid-March as the pandemic has cratered the economy.
“Millions of people are on furlough and have been let go, so people are trying to save money. We see lots of people reducing coverage as a cost-saving measure. Clearly there is a financial stress,” Pires said. “My worry during hurricane season is contacting the customers over and over and over to make sure they don’t have a lapse in coverage during this time.”
He added: “Covid makes everything a little more challenging, but it doesn’t mean it’s OK to not prepare as much.”
Fatme Woheidy’s Houston home flooded during Harvey after a reservoir behind her neighborhood opened. She and her family are now considering flood insurance for the first time.
“I was prepared last time. I got food. I got water. We were prepared for everything, but we lost everything,” Woheidy said. “I lost my wedding album and the photos of my kids. I was sad and knew I was going to be tired and work a lot.”
Because of coronavirus, Woheidy said she would rather stay on the second floor of her house than go to a potentially crowded shelter where the risk of catching the virus could be high.
“Covid is dangerous. It’s not a joke,” Woheidy said. “I have Lysol wipes, masks and sanitizers. A shelter is my last resort if I have no other place to stay.”
Many border-town neighborhoods, or colonias, in the Rio Grande Valley don’t have reliable tap water. At a time when hygiene and hand-washing is essential, this will present challenges if already scarce water supplies become even scarcer in the wake of a hurricane.
But even during a pandemic some advice remains the same.
“You need to pay attention to your evacuation routes. If you’ve got a clear inland evacuation route, you might have a little more time. If your route is vulnerable to storm surges, you can’t wait,” Nielsen-Gammon said."

The combined impacts of human-caused sea level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding within the next 30 years, even with relatively ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, a new global study has found.
In a worst-case scenario where emissions continue to rise and no efforts are made to adapt to the rising sea levels, coastal assets worth US$14.2tn – about 20% of global GDP – could be at risk by the end of the century.
Rising sea levels caused by global heating that expands the oceans and melts land-based ice could mean that one-in-100-year floods occurring now would become one-in-10-year floods by the end of the century. As much as 4% of the world’s population could be affected by flooding.
The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, identified “hotspot” regions at risk of extensive flooding.
South-eastern China, Australia’s north, Bangladesh, West Bengal and Gujarat in India were especially at risk. In the United States, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland were considered to be most exposed, as were the UK, northern France and northern Germany.
But the study also shows how the risk of damage from rising sea levels and storm surges will continue to rise even if emissions are kept to a level that would keep the global temperature rise to well below 2C by the end of this century.
The new study builds on findings published by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2019 that predicted extreme sea level events could be near annual occurrences by the middle of this century on many coastlines.
Prof Ian Young, a co-author of the study at the University of Melbourne, said: “We certainly need to mitigate our greenhouse gases but that won’t solve this problem.
“The sea level rise is already baked in – even if we reduce emissions today the sea level will continue to rise because the glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years.”
According to the study, about 148 million people globally are exposed to flooding events today.
If greenhouse gas emissions rise moderately – the equivalent of 1.8C of global warming by the end of the century – a further 54 million people will be exposed. But if emissions are allowed to spiral in a worst-case scenario, then this number rises to 77 million.
About US$10.2tn of coastal assets are exposed to coastal flooding in 2100, even with emissions kept at moderate level, according to the study.
All the figures modelled in the study assume that no adaptive measures are taken, illustrating the benefits of taking early action to reduce the impact of flooding events.
Young said: “When most people think of sea level rise they think about 3 or 4mm per year, but when flooding occurs it happens it’s when you also have a storm.
“That happens today and we have seen that on the coast of New South Wales last week. Sea level rise exacerbates the magnitude – and increases the frequency – of these flooding events.
‘There are significantly larger areas of land flooded and that will have significant economic impacts on infrastructure.
“Even if we mitigate greenhouse gases it does not make much effect. We have to adapt to this – it is going to happen so we have to look at either hard engineering solutions, or do we look at planned retreat and move populations and that’s incredibly difficult, or there are nature-based coastal defence systems.”
Ebru Kirezci, the lead researcher, also of the University of Melbourne, said: “We need to adapt to sea level rise and climate change.
“Adaptation is the only way out and we need to adopt some risk mitigation strategies like sea walls and dykes and develop forecasting and warning systems, or coastal retreat, which means the relocation of coastal communities to safer places.”
Prof John Church, a leading expert on sea level rise at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were valuable.
He said the study had brought together several elements to estimate extreme impacts, but there was more work to be done to understand additional impacts from changes to the severity of storms and waves.
He said there was also likely to be significant impacts along estuaries and it was important to note that “sea level rise will not stop in 2100 under any scenario”.
He said: “With more emissions the higher the [sea level] rises, with commitments of metres of sea level rise over coming centuries with the higher scenarios. The impacts to 2100 are the introduction to the future.”
While coastal flooding could impact 20% of global GDP this, he said, was a reflection of a society that “love the coast”.
“We need more thoughtful and forward-looking planning.”"

'Everything is burning': Argentina's delta fires rage out of control
",,"Cattle ranching and drought have turned the Paraná River grasslands to tinder, threatening disaster for the area’s wildlife

A raging fire described as “completely out of control” is threatening one of South America’s major wetland ecosystems. The fire has been burning for months now, and is visible from the balconies of luxury apartments along the shoreline of the Paraná River in Argentina’s central city of Rosario
Locals have been sharing photos and videos of the fires on social media.

In normal times, Rosario’s riverfront homes enjoy a spectacular view of the seemingly never-ending green grasslands on the opposite bank of the Paraná, a waterway stretching over a mile across as it passes through the city. 
 In recent months, however, dwellers in the luxury condos have been congregating on their balconies as the wall of red flames from thousands of fires raging through the Paraná delta grasslands rises high into the sky.
“Everything is burning, it’s completely out of control,” Leonel Mingo, a spokesperson for Greenpeace Argentina, told the Guardian. “Once a fire reaches that scale, it becomes virtually impossible to stop.”
The Paraná is South America’s second largest river after the Amazon and the eighth longest river in the world. Its floodplain, known by Rosarinos as “la isla”, is not actually an island, but a vast delta covering some 15,000km2 , through which the Paraná drains towards the Atlantic Ocean 300km away.The giant delta is clearly visible in satellite imagery as a dark green wedge on the northern margin of the Paraná from Rosario to Buenos Aires.Giant plumes of smoke from the fires raging since February have at times covered the streets of Rosario and other places along the Paraná with a layer of ash from scorched plants and animals. The air in Rosario has been unbreathable for weeks at a time.
Jorge Liotta, a biologist specialising in the abundant wildlife of the delta, lives with his wife and two young children in the nearby riverside city of San Nicolás de los Arroyos. Their home is just a block from the Paraná’s shoreline.“The other night I walked to the river and could see seven fires burning in the distance,” Liotta told the Guardian. “It depends on the wind if the smoke hits you, but when it does, the smoke is so thick that the sun turns red and you can barely see the house next door. What’s worse, it gets inside your home. People with asthma and other breathing difficulties are really suffering.”Far from abating, the number of fires has been rising. Liotta works at the Scasso Natural Science Museum in San Nicolás, where he has been monitoring the delta fires via Nasa satellites. “We’ve identified 8,024 likely fires so far this year, almost half of them this month of July.”
Liotta worked backwards and found the scale of thecalamity was unprecedented. “The average number of yearly satellite-detected hotspots was only 1,800 in 2012–2019. We’re already at over 8,000 and barely halfway through the year.”Although cattle ranchers, illegal hunters and property developers have encroached on its rich habitat, the Paraná delta still teems with diverse wildlife, all facing a dire challenge to their survival.Liotta says it breaks his heart to imagine the scale of destruction. “I can’t help thinking about the animals when I see the fires. If we humans are suffering so much, can you imagine what it must be like for the creatures being burned alive?”
He recites a list of the delta’s species: “There’s the carpincho [capybara], the world’s largest rodent, a relative to the guinea pig, but the size of a farm pig, weighing over 60 kilos, aquatic and highly gregarious. Then the gato montés [wildcat], a solitary hunter at the top of the delta food chain despite being only the size of a domestic cat, either spotted like a leopard or entirely black like a panther. Then there’s an endless variety of birds, invertebrates, mollusks, rare insects, amphibians, reptiles … which must be suffering an incredible mortality rate.”
The coronavirus pandemic has added to the problems, making it impossible for experts to travel to the affected areas. But it has not thwarted cattle ranchers, driven from more productive lands by the growth of soya bean plantations, from sending their cattle to graze on the constantly shifting delta islands.With hardly any roads or infrastructure, the delta remains a daunting challenge for those without expert knowledge of the region. “You have to get around on horseback or by boat”, says Liotta. “Cattle ranchers ship their livestock to the islands on barcos jaula [cage boats], sometimes two storeys high, that carry around 60 heads of cattle each.” 
The unregulated expansion of cattle ranching is the main culprit for the expanding fires says Laura Prol, an ecologist from the Rosario-based environmental NGO Taller Ecologista.“The delta has always been used by livestock farmers to graze their cattle, but the number of cattle grew 500% between between 2000 and 2010,” Prol told the Guardian. “Although that number has dropped some in the last decade, ranchers continue burning the dead winter grass as if they were still in the 19th century, the idea being for the new grass beneath to sprout stronger.”Prol points to illegal carpincho hunters lighting fires to corral their prey and tourists from Rosario who cross the river to hold barbecues and kayak in the delta as other likely culprits.“But the real problem is that 2020 has been one of the driest of recent years, which causes two problems. First, without proper humidity the dead grass becomes highly flammable, and second, the low level of the river dries out the canals that usually act as buffers that stop the fire from expanding beyond individual islands,” says Prol.The environmentalist is also frustrated by the coronavirus pandemic making it almost impossible to see the terrain first hand. “We can’t go, but cattle ranchers, tourists and illegal hunters are still getting there.”The shocking photos posted on social media, and the sheer extent and duration of the fires, have prodded the authorities into action.Environment minister Juan Cabandié has opened legal action against alleged culprits, tweeting geolocation maps pinpointing the fires and demanding local judges identify and arrest the landowners. “They must tell us who owns these lands, arrest them and put those responsible on trial.”
The city of Rosario has also demanded legal action and sent firefighting helicopters to the area.But environmentalists say more is needed. “Legal action won’t stop the fires. What is needed is a long-term environmental policy to deal with the drop in the level of the river caused by the changing climate and by the El Niño weather phenomenon,” says Prol. “This year’s dry spell might also be an effect of the fires in the Amazon last year, in which a large amount of vapour-producing vegetation that then turned to rain perished. Finding the culprits for this year’s fires is of course important, but we need real environmental protection.” Mingo of Greenpeace agrees. “We have been lobbying for years for a comprehensive wetlands law. The reason these fires are raging is because there is no legislation. We need to ban cattle farming in the delta. Because right now, with this dry weather, with the drying up of the Paraná river and without a campaign to change the traditional use of fire by cattle ranchers to clear land for pasture, you have the perfect storm.”
