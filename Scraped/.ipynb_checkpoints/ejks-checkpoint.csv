REYES
MANILA, Philippines — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said she intended to wrap up next year the preliminary examination of the allegations of crimes against humanity that President Rodrigo Duterte committed in his war on drugs, a move welcomed by the complainants who it saw as a “glimmer of hope” that he would be held liable for the thousands killed.
In a 77-page report on Thursday that included the Philippine case, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she had looked into the complaints that Mr. Duterte and other senior government officials “actively promoted and encouraged the killing of suspected or purported drug users and/or dealers.”

She said it was “in such context” that law enforcers and “unidentified assailants” had carried out thousands of killings throughout the country.
“During 2020, the Office (of the Prosecutor) will aim to finalize the preliminary examination in order to enable the prosecutor to reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines,” Bensouda said.FEATURED STORIES

Malacañang did not immediately respond to the Inquirer’s request for comment.
In a statement in February 2018, Bensouda emphasized that a preliminary examination was a process of examining available information to determine whether she should proceed with an investigation in accordance with the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC. 
A livid Mr. Duterte verbally attacked Bensouda and the ICC for acting on the complaint of crimes against humanity filed by lawyer Jude Josue Sabio in April 2017.
In August last year, a similar complaint was filed in the ICC by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) on behalf of the relatives of eight alleged victims of extrajudicial killings attributed to the President’s war on drugs.
“People are already inquiring and keenly awaiting an update on the case,” he added.
The Philippine National Police has reported that more than 6,600 have been killed since the antinarcotics campaign began on Mr. Duterte’s first day in office, but various local and international human rights groups say the death toll is in the tens of thousands.
For former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, one of the President’s arch critics, Bensouda’s report signaled that “justice is coming.”

He urged PNP officers who carried out the drug killings to now decide “whether you would fall with Duterte on being liable for crimes against humanity or you would partly cleanse your crime by being a witness for the ICC prosecutors.”
“Now, let me point out the obvious,” he said. “As Duterte steps down from office in just a little over two years, he would not be able to protect you.”
“In fact, even Duterte won’t be able to protect himself,” Trillanes said.
Bensouda said the ICC “retains jurisdiction over alleged crimes that have occurred on the territory of the Philippines during the period when it was
a state party to the (Rome) Statute”— from Nov. 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, which was the day before the Duterte government withdrew from the treaty.
She noted that the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction was “not subject to any time limit,” or even if the country were “no longer a state party to the ICC.”
“It validates our view and repudiates the Duterte administration’s weak and erroneous position on the effectivity, jurisdiction and independence of the ICC on this matter as a parallel or alternative legal remedy when victims are running out of options to turn to,” Olalia said.
“Most importantly, it validates the fact that all these years, what we have endured are self-serving and self-righteous justifications for extrajudicial killings and other acts amounting to crimes against humanity,” he said.
The ICC prosecutor said her office used “open source information,” including news reports and official statements by the Philippine government,
in examining the actions of the President and other public officials.
“Open source information indicates that a limited number of investigations and prosecutions have been initiated (and, in some cases, completed) at the national level in respect of direct perpetrators of certain criminal conduct that allegedly took place in the context of, or connection to, the (drug war) campaign,” she said.
In assessing the complains, Bensouda said her office reached out to “relevant stakeholders” and met with members of civil society organizations.


“The office has also been following with concern reports of threats and other measures apparently taken against human rights defenders, including those who have criticized the [drug war],” she said.

Lt. Col. Lino Capellan, regional police spokesperson, said only 46 drug suspects were killed during police operations in 2019 compared to 154 slain in the previous year.

He attributed the decline to the “reduced number of drug
personalities who resisted arrest, or those who engaged police in a shootout.”
He also said the decline in number could indicate that “fewer people engaged in illegal drugs” amid the government’s aggressive anti-drug campaign.FEATURED STORIES

He claimed, however, that many of the 46 persons killed “resisted arrest.”
“No rubout, no extra-judicial killing, these were all legitimate law enforcement operations,” Capellan said on the number of people killed during police raids. 
He said police seized about P60.1 million worth of illegal drugs during the 1,528 operations conducted for the period.
A total of 7,887.26 grams of shabu and 5,615.05 grams of marijuana were recovered.
Brig. Gen. Alfred Corpus, PRO-12 regional director, also reported at least 60 illegal firearms and 17 explosives confiscated by the police last year.
Capellan also noted a 22-percent drop in the number of drug
personalities the police arrested during the period.
A total of 1,576 drug personalities were arrested in 2019 and
were eventually charged. He claimed that of those arrested, 1,141 were drug peddlers and 435 were users.

Gen. Debold Sinas, director of the National Capital Region Police Office (File Photo from NCRPO)
CEBU CITY, Philippines – The war on drugs in Central Visayas escalated when Major General Debold Sinas was its top policeman.
But his stint in the region was marred by the rise of unsolved killings of people linked to the illegal drugs trade, said lawyer Alvin Odron, director of the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7).

“He (Sinas) had a colorful stint here in the region. During his watch, the number of killings definitely increased,” he told the Inquirer over the phone.
Odron, however, was not able to provide the figures as his documents were left in his office. Sinas was director of the Central Visayas police from July 2018 to October 2019 before he was assigned at the National Capital Region Police Office.FEATURED STORIES

CHR-7 chief investigator Leo Villarino said Sinas would always be remembered as the police official who was firm in his decision not to give human rights investigators copies of police reports on the various killings in the region.
“While we appreciate his relentless campaign against illegal drugs in Central Visayas, there were just so many killings under his watch as police director here,” he said. 
“The CHR-7 is conducting an investigation on these killings although we failed to get the documents from the police,” he added.
Jaime Paglinawan of Bayan Muna Central Visayas described Sinas as a “severe human rights violator” when he was Central Visayas’ police director.
“Aside from several persons killed during his anti-drugs campaign, a number of farmers accused as members of the New People’s Army in Negros Oriental were also killed during his watch,” Paglinawan said.
“And his usual defense was these persons tried to shoot it out with the police. That’s how we remember him (Sinas),” he added.
Sinas had repeatedly explained that it was just normal for his men to protect themselves from unlawful aggression.

Bote and Lubigan had no known links to drugs. Police said no clear motive for the attack on Bote had emerged yet but they were looking at politics in the killing of Lubigan.
Atmosphere of lawlessness 
“What is going on? Are these deliberate and orchestrated attempts at creating an atmosphere of lawlessness to justify strongman rule?” Sen. Francis Pangilinan, LP president, said in a statement on Saturday.
“Another local executive in Luzon and two more in Mindanao were killed today even before authorities can provide the lead to the killing of two mayors earlier this week. The warehouse of suspected drug lord Peter Lim in Cebu was bombed on Thursday,” Pangilinan said.
The senator was referring to the killing in separate attacks on Saturday of Michael Magallanes, 38, a newly elected village councilor in Zamboanga City, and Nassif Palawan Bansil, 31, a municipal councilor of Kapatagan, Lanao del Sur province.
The LP leader said the Philippine National Police must take immediate action to solve the high-profile killings.
“A swift, sure and lawful move by the PNP to bring the killers behind bars is what the public awaits. At the same time, the police must ensure visibility, especially in key critical areas to prevent another bloody incident,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


“What we want is a safe, secure and peaceful society, not a gangster land,” he added.
Sen. Bam Aquino said the assassination of Lubigan showed the extent to which violence had become the norm.
“For violence to stop, the government must stop using force. If they keep using violence as the solution to the country’s problems, our society will not be peaceful and safe,” Aquino said.
Nothing to worry about
But PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde said the people should not be worried over the killings of local officials.
“We should not have any worries. We should not be afraid,” Albayalde told reporters in Albay province on Saturday when asked about the killings of Halili, Bote and Lubigan.
“These [killings] are not systematic. There is no pattern. We do not know if this involves politics. There are a lot of possible reasons,” he added.
The PNP chief said a thorough investigation of the killings was going on.
“We know that here in our country, every election season, although it is puzzling, before, during and after the election, there are elected officials who die,” he said.
Police said Lubigan had “no known enemy” and that they had ruled out illegal drugs.


Politics
Investigators said they were looking at politics behind the attack on Lubigan, as the vice mayor told people close to him on Friday that he intended to run for mayor in next year’s midterm elections.
“Initially, what we are looking at is politics,” said Chief Supt. Edward Carranza, director of the Calabarzon police.
Asked for details, Carranza said Lubigan was serving his last term and that investigators had received information that the vice mayor told people close to him on Friday that he would run for mayor in 2019.
In 2016, Lubigan ran as a candidate of the United Nationalist Alliance. Mayor Melandres de Sagun, who is also serving his last term, belongs to the same political party.
De Sagun is on leave.
“Trece Martires has this [record] of intense political rivalry,” Carranza said, but he declined to name any politician who might be involved in the attack on Lubigan.
In recent elections, however, candidates from local political clans have been running unopposed.
Cavite Gov. Juanito Crispin Remulla said the last election-related violence recorded in the province was about 11 years ago, but added that he, too, would describe as “hot” the political climate in the provincial capital. —WITH REPORTS FROM MICHAEL JAUCIAN AND MARICAR CINCO

Chief Supt. Eliseo Rasco, Soccsksargen police director, said fighting drugs remained to be the priority of police.
Cop suspect 
One of those killed was PO1 Rommel Barcellano, alias “Banjo,” 38, an intelligence agent of the South Cotabato police office.
Barcellano was supposedly on Mr. Duterte’s drug watch list. The policeman’s family denied he was involved in the drug trade.
Police carried out the war on drugs through two main strategies—“Oplan Tokhang” and “Oplan Double Barrel.”
Tokhang, derived from the Visayan words “toktok” (knock) and “hangyo” (plead), was supposed to be a bloodless method wherein police simply ask suspects during home visits to mend their ways.
Tokhang, however, had become associated with the bloodshed that characterized Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign.

Davao tactic
The President used the scheme to fight drugs in Davao City when he was still its mayor.
Human rights and religious groups have criticized the killings because most of the dead came from the poor.
In his third State of the Nation Address in July, the President reiterated that his antidrug campaign would be “chilling and relentless.”
In Soccsksargen, police data showed 42,946 individuals (40,327 suspected users and 2,619 suspected pushers) surrendered or presented themselves to authorities after 492,773 Tokhang visits by police since Mr. Duterte became President.

An outspoken Church critic of killings associated with President Rodrigo Duterte’s antidrug campaign appealed to people not to get numbed by the daily bloodshed they saw on the streets, warning that time would come when relatives of those unjustly slain would seek justice through revenge.

“People just watch and go on with business as usual. They have even gotten used to watching the killings as they happen and go past the victims unaffected,” he added.
“Children are exposed to so much violence,” David said. 
David and a group supporting relatives of victims of street executions denounced what they said was the unabated violence and impunity which had become routine following the launch of the President’s antidrug campaign, which he had described as “chilling and relentless.”
David said what alarmed him was the possibility of some victims’ families resorting to violence to bring justice to their loved ones.
Devastating impact
He also expressed fears for people reported missing after they had been linked to drugs.
“We’ve had cases of people abducted before, but their dead bodies were usually dumped a few days later,” David said.

Baigani, a group that supports wives, mothers and children of summary killings, said losing a parent might have devastating effects on children.
“Many of the families affected by the war on drugs are young families with children as young as newborns, and the rest are in their teens,” the group said.
“Left by one or both parents who have been killed or incarcerated, the young children are thrown into deep poverty with no support from the government at the local or national level,” it said.
Baigani was set to publish later this year a study conducted in three Metro Manila cities on the impact of the drug war on families.
It was prepared with Miriam College Department of Social Work, Ateneo de Manila University Department of Psychology and the Diocese of Novaliches.
David said he and Baigani continued to monitor drug-related killings in the Diocese of Kalookan, which comprised Caloocan City-South, Malabon City and Navotas City.
From Oct. 7 to 12 alone, the diocese recorded six summary killings in Caloocan, including the shooting of PO1 Marvin Anthony German at the village of 46.
German was shot by two motorcycle-riding assailants.
Regular occurrence
The list of people killed by motorcycle-riding men also included Noel Aljezera, 41, a known addict who was shot and killed on an overpass along Edsa at Bagong Barrio, Barangay 138, past 7 p.m. on Oct. 7.


PO3 Ernesto Estrellas, 37, was shot along C3 Road the following day.
On Oct. 10, around 10 p.m., 26-year-old single mother Clariz Marie Ocampo was also shot and killed by unknown assailants along Don Vicente Ang Street at Bagong Barrio.
Police later tagged Ocampo as a possible “police asset” and said a sachet of “shabu” (crystal meth) was found in her pocket.
Baigani said the sudden loss of a mother, like Ocampo, in a family could lead to worse events for children.

“We cannot allow this to continue to happen. We beseech our fellow Filipinos to be vigilant and be the voice of the voiceless and no longer idly stand by in the face of Church persecution and blatant assault on the human rights of our people,” it added.
Romano, an activist priest, was abducted by armed men in Barangay Tisa, Cebu City, on July 11, 1985. He was never seen again. 
His disappearance was remembered by friends, seminarians and members of the clergy with a Mass and lighting of candles at Redemptorist Church as well as a prayer service at a stone marker in Tisa, which describes the kidnappers as agents of “the deposed Marcos regime.”
Romano, 44, identified himself with the poor and joined protest actions denouncing human rights abuses.
“Thirty-three years have passed, and still no justice for Father Romano and other victims of martial law,” the statement said.
“Our mourning and lamentations become more intense and profound as we continue to witness these days the brutal deaths of our flocks, including our shepherd,” it said.
‘Stop killing our people’

The Redemptorist community appealed to the government: “Stop Church persecution. Stop killing our people.”
While the statement did not mention any names, the congregation was clearly alluding to President Duterte, whose brutal war on drugs has killed thousands of small-time drug users and pushers.
Fr. Crispin Mostajo, parish priest of Our Mother of Perpetual Help Church in Cebu City, said the series of killings in the country was alarming.
Three priests were among those killed.
On April 29, Fr. Mark Anthony Ventura, a human rights and antimining advocate, was shot dead after saying Mass in Gattaran town, Cagayan province.
On June 10, Fr. Richmond Nilo of the Diocese of Cabanatuan was shot by unidentified men while he was preparing to say Mass at Nuestra Señora de las Nieves Chapel in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija province.
A suspect in the killing of Nilo was arrested by police last Thursday.
On Dec. 4, 2017, Fr. Marcelito Paez was shot dead by motorcycle-riding men in Jaen, Nueva Ecija.
Paez, a retired priest, had facilitated the release of a political detainee.

“I didn’t expect this to happen. I’ll take over as mayor, but I’m saddened by the turn of events,” said Rocky Gabutan, the current vice mayor, as he wiped away tears.
Stripped of police control 
Blanco, 59, was the fifth to be slain among mayors the President had publicly linked to the illegal drug trade.
Killed were Mayors Antonio Halili of Tanauan City, Batangas province, on July 3; Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao province, in October 2016; Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte province, in November 2016; and Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. of Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental province, in July 2017.
Blanco was among more than 20 local officials stripped of control over the local police in October last year after the President linked them to the drug trade.
Since then, Blanco had feared for his life and even altered his routine, such as spending the night in his office several days of the week, for his safety.
At past Tuesday midnight, a white van arrived at the municipal hall, according to police investigators. Four persons alighted and, at gunpoint, ordered two watchmen to drop to the ground.

Burst of gunfire
“After a second, a burst of gunfire was heard from the mayor’s office and then the unidentified persons left,” SPO1 Dionisio Tagopa, one of the investigators, told the Inquirer.
The watchmen ran up to the mayor’s office and found him bloodied while sitting on a wooden bench in front of the television. Blanco was pronounced dead at the hospital.
“The mayor was there as he was sleeping in his office,” said Senior Insp. Jayr Palcon.
The two policemen manning a police station, four meters away from the municipal hall, did not hear the gunfire because of the rain, and failed to quickly respond to the shooting, Tagopa said.
Under surveillance
The rest of the lawmen were out to serve an arrest warrant against a crime suspect, he said.
“It just happened that many of our policemen were not here,” Tagopa said.
Celia Gabutan, municipal revenue collector, said the killers might have cased the mayor before the killing since they went up the same stairs that only he used.
“The mayor has been sleeping at his office for some time already. The suspects must have known this,” she said.


The municipal hall is neither manned by security guards nor equipped with closed-circuit television.
Blanco, in an earlier interview, said he was worried about his safety after his name was dragged into the drug trade.
“I’m afraid I might be assassinated. I just hope that they will understand that I had never been involved in illegal drugs,” he said.
“I’m really shocked. I have been serving the town for 22 years now, and my name was never besmirched until this issue came,” he added.
Blanco served as municipal councilor in 1995 before he was elected mayor in 1998, a position he held for nine years. In 2007, the term limit forced him to run for vice mayor; he won.
Blanco was reelected mayor in 2010, 2013 and 2016. —WITH REPORTS FROM INQUIRER RESEARCH AND AFP

Seven other suspected members of the Manite gang, which authorities also linked to gunrunning, were arrested.

Prior to the operation, a team from the Station Drug Enforcement Unit (SDEU) of the Makati police received a tip about a meeting taking place Tuesday afternoon between two groups, one of which was led by a woman known as “Ganda,” on  Bunyi Street, Buting, in Pasig.
Insp. Jeson Vigilla, the SDEU chief, said that when they arrived at the area, they spotted the gang members in a white Toyota Vios (CSC311).FEATURED STORIES

As the police moved in, one of the passengers fired at them, setting off a running gun battle that ended with the Vios being cornered on A. Tanangco Street.
One of the suspects, a certain “Topher” from Comembo, Makati, was killed. 
An SDEU member, PO1 Tinpee Merdegia, was wounded.
The three other passengers of the Vios surrendered, among them “Ganda,” a call center agent whose real name was Theresa Elva de Paz. The others were identified as John Rapsing, a former Army soldier; and Daniel Novie Bernardo.
Father and son
Four other gang members were arrested on Bunyi Street—Mark Tampos, Joharah Sally Imogbel, Jennelyn Borromeo and Jhon Michael Caliboso.
The police said they found five plastic packets of “shabu” (crystal meth), a digital weighing scale and a .45-caliber Kimber Ultra Carry pistol inside their suspects’ vehicle.

Norman Ace Manite, the alleged leader of the group, remains at large.

In an interview over radio station dzBB on Sunday, PNP spokesperson Col. Bernard Banac said the intensified anti-illegal drug campaign this month would be aimed at drug supply reduction.

“We want to defeat the illegal drug menace because all of us are its victims … We expect a higher number of possible casualties in our campaign against illegal drugs because we have drug offenders who refuse to stop engaging in the narcotics trade and there are still many of them who continue to resist arrest and fight it out when caught,” Banac said.
He noted that even PNP personnel would end up as casualties if they were involved in the illegal drug trade.FEATURED STORIES

But Banac said that casualties would be avoided as much as possible in any police operation.
“We need to enforce the law and if a suspect resists and fights it out … we can do nothing but use equal force,” he said. 
Based on PNP data, 6,600 drug suspects and 49 policemen were killed in the war on drugs from July 2016 to May 2019 during 153,000 anti-illegal drug operations nationwide, which also resulted in the arrest of some 240,000 suspects.
“Despite our efforts, illegal drugs continue to flood our country. This is what we have to stop, the network of narcotics supply,” Banac explained.
The PNP spokesperson noted that big drug syndicates were the sources of illegal drugs.

“It’s now open season for killers and assassins to ply their trade with impunity,” Villarin added.
Meanwhile, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano tagged the incident as “another proof of the culture of violence perpetuating in our country right now.” 
The opposition lawmaker also suspects that the slaying is related to the Duterte administration’s brutal war on drugs, as it took place after “President Duterte’s speech in Bohol wherein he egged vice mayors to replace their mayors through illegal means.”
“While an investigation is yet to be carried out, there is an impression that this case is related to the Duterte administration’s war on drugs,” Alejano said. “What is more troubling is that this heinous crime comes at the heels of President Duterte’s speech in Bohol wherein he egged vice mayors to replace their mayors through illegal means.”
But regardless of who committed the crime, Alejano said “what we are seeing are emboldened perpetrators who have no respect for the law.”
“Cases such as this heighten the sense of impunity already prevailing under the present situation of peace and order in our communities,” he said.
“Nasaan na ngayon ang pangakong pagsugpo ng kriminalidad sa loob lamang ng tatlo hanggang anim na buwan na iniyayabang ng administrasyon?” he added.“Instead of feeling safe, Filipinos are feeling more unsecured today.”

Earlier, Malacañang condemned the assassination, whom presidential spokesperson Harry Roque called “napakatibay na kasangga” (a strong ally) of President Rodrigo Duterte in the war on drugs.
Halili, known for his shame campaign for parading drug suspects and criminals around his city, was earlier included in the list of “narco-politicians.” But the mayor denied having links to the illegal narcotics trade.

TANAUAN CITY — Antonio Halili came down hard on illegal drugs even as he also fended off allegations that he was a protector of drug syndicates and expressed fear for his life shortly after the Duterte administration launched its brutal crackdown on narcotics.

“We are shocked, we are saddened,” Vice Mayor Jhoanna Villamor, who stood next to the mayor, told a radio station shortly after the shooting.
Halili was declared dead on arrival at C.P. Reyes Hospital. 
Police were looking at the mayor’s shame campaign against drug suspects and criminals as one of the possible motives for the attack.
Halili was the fourth mayor killed in Mr. Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, which has left thousands of drug suspects dead and drawn condemnation from local and international human rights organizations.
The three other mayors killed were Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao province, in October 2016; Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte province, in November 2016; and Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. of Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental province, in July 2017.
Elected to a second term in 2016, Halili talked and acted tough on drugs and crime like Mr. Duterte, earning him the moniker “Little Digong” in the city south of Manila.

Halili gained notoriety when he paraded drug pushers and petty thieves, while they carried cardboard signs specifying their offenses. Human rights officials were alarmed.
“[My intention] is to warn the people. If you see these people [tagged as drug users], you would not want any of your family near them,” the mayor told the Inquirer in 2016 in defense of his shame campaign.
Halili’s name later appeared on Mr. Duterte’s so-called narcolist of officials allegedly linked to illegal drugs.
He was among 1,000 mayors who separately met with the President in Malacañang in January 2017 to clear their names.
In October 2017, Halili was stripped of supervisory powers over the local police as illegal drugs proliferated in his city amid allegations that he might have been involved. He denied the allegations.
Police crackdown
In August 2016, Halili said he supported Mr. Duterte’s campaign but believed drug kingpins should be the main targets. Otherwise, he pointed out, thousands would be killed.
VIEW TO A KILL A photographer checks a grassy area where a sniper may have shot Mayor Halili about 150 meters away.
In the interview with Reuters, Halili expressed apprehension over the way police carried out the crackdown and the reliability of their intelligence.
He voiced fears he might be accused of colluding with drug syndicates.
“If you are the mayor, and if somehow your views differ from the police, they will create a story, say you are into drugs and go after you and kill you. What can you do?” he said.


After Monday’s shooting, investigators scoured a nearby grassy knoll from where the gunman might have fired the shot.
“They did not see anybody approach him. They just heard a gunshot so the assumption or allegation was it could have been a sniper shot,” said Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde.
Extraordinary distance
Supt. Renato Mercado, Tanauan police chief, said the shot was fired from about 150 meters away.
“The distance from the position was extraordinary. It could not be done by an ordinary person. His skill can be compared to a trained sniper,” Mercado said.
Albayalde said investigators were looking into the connection between the killing and Halili’s “walk of shame” campaign.
“As a city mayor, he might have embarrassed and hurt people because that [campaign] was controversial,” he told reporters at Camp Crame.
Last week, Halili submitted additional documents to the National Police Commission to clear his name of the drug allegations, according to city information officer Gerard Laresma.
“[Halili] was telling us there were threats but nothing really specific. What he would always say was: if it’s my time, it’s my time,” Laresma said. —With reports from Jaymee T. Gamil, Inquirer Reseearch and the wires

While many relatives of EJK victims are afraid to speak up, Lazaro is unfazed. “My relatives said I should stop speaking. I said that if I stop doing this, it means that I have accepted my son’s death,” she told the Inquirer.
She added: “I know my son is dead but if I do not speak up, the killings will continue.” 
Lazaro has even started bringing her grandchildren to rallies as she believes it is just right for them to be aware of the realities of the drug war.
As for allegations that she was being paid to join protests, Lazaro pointed out that they would not be going out in the streets if they were not fighting for something.
“I want my son to have a name, not just a number. He was not a drug addict,” she said.

Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin on Wednesday blamed the deadly attacks on two local officials this week on President Rodrigo Duterte who, he said, inspired disrespect for the rule of law by promising protection to police who would kill drug users and dealers.
According to the opposition lawmaker, the shooting deaths of the mayors of Tanauan City, Batangas province, and General Tinio, Nueva Ecija province, showed that once the rule of law is abandoned, “anybody with a gun and a grudge has a license to kill people without worrying about the consequences.”

No prosecution
He said the President himself gave the license to kill by repeatedly assuring police and soldiers that they would not be prosecuted for carrying out his brutal war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

A sniper felled Mayor Antonio Halili during flag-raising rites in front of City Hall in Tanauan on Monday morning. Halili didn’t make it alive to hospital.
On Tuesday afternoon, two motorcycle-riding men pumped five bullets into General Tinio Mayor Ferdinand Bote as he was being driven out of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) compound in Cabanatuan City. 
Bote was taken to the hospital across the street from the NIA compound but he was already dead when he got there, according to the police.
Halili was a supporter of the President, but he once appeared on the President’s list of narcopoliticians.
Bote was not on that list. Police said they were looking at politics and business in their investigation of his slaying.
Sense of insecurity
The killings have worsened Filipinos’ sense of insecurity, Villarin said.

“Duterte’s attack against institutions upholding the rule of law has led to a weakened state and a population desperate for security thereby pushing everyone to bad decisions culminating [in] a vicious cycle of violence that destroys society,” he said.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque denied there was a culture of impunity in the country.
“We continue to adhere to the rule of law and consider the recent killings of high-profile figures an attempt to erode confidence in the President, whose main platform of governance rests on fighting crimes,” Roque said in a statement.
He gave assurance that the police were “sparing no effort to find and capture the killers of the two slain mayors.”
Gabriela Rep. Emmi de Jesus condemned the killings and called for a thorough and impartial investigation.
“A thorough and impartial investigation is needed and hope these cases would not be just another contribution to the worsening culture of impunity,” De Jesus said.
Vice President Leni Robredo appealed to the police to investigate the killings and take steps to prevent further bloodshed.
“It’s as if no one is spared, from priests to civil servants and government officials, to loiterers and the youth,” Robredo said.
“Are we going to allow violence to finally reign in our country?” she said.
Martial law


Opposition Sen. Francis Pangilinan said the killings could be used by the Duterte administration as grounds for the imposition of martial law on the entire country.
Mindanao remains under martial law in the aftermath of a terrorist occupation of Marawi City last year.
Pangilinan, president of the Liberal Party, said he would not discount the possibility of the Duterte administration using the assassinations of Halili and Bote and other recent high-profile killings as grounds for expanding military rule throughout the country.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if such a scenario unfolds, with the majority in Congress endorsing it,” Pangilinan said in a text message.
“After the bizarre quo warranto decision ousting [Chief Justice Maria Lourdes] Sereno, any and all official acts of this administration can be legally justified by the Supreme Court using twisted and witless legal reasoning,” he added.
“The only recourse now is to work toward forging and mobilizing a broad unity among our citizens in defense of our democratic rights, our sovereignty and the rule of law,” he said.
Law and order breakdown
Sen. Nancy Binay said the killings of Halili and Bote should not be considered isolated cases, but should be seen as a “systemic failure” of law enforcement.
But Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a former Philippine National Police chief, told reporters that the Philippines had not yet reached the point of law and order breakdown.
“But I fear that we may reach that if the PNP does not initiate control measures,” Lacson said.


Lacson said he did not agree with suggestions that the President’s incendiary rhetoric had triggered the killings.
“No, I don’t think so. Especially in local politics, political battles are so fierce, they resort to killing each other. But it is incumbent upon the PNP to do something about it. How? Control the movement of firearms,” he said. —With reports from Christine O. Avendaño, Vince F. Nonato and DJ Yap

Myka Ulpina was the latest to be added to a growing list of children who had died in connection with President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs.

Life wasted
“Another life was again wasted and added to the thousands of innocent victims of this spurious government campaign that has led to nothing,” she added. 
De Lima, who was indicted for drug trafficking after her scathing criticism of the President’s drug war, maintained that the administration’s antinarcotics strategy was a “sham and a complete failure as it failed to arrest the entry of illegal drugs into the country.”
She also assailed the Philippine National Police for claiming that the antidrug campaign was a success even after Mr. Duterte himself had repeatedly admitted that it was a failure.
De Lima said that PNP chief, Police Gen. Oscar Albayalde, issued the “declaration to justify the brutal killings under the Duterte regime.”
“They conveniently set aside the fact that innocents continue to die because of this murderous drug war,” she stressed.
“Does this government consider this a victory? Do they consider it a victory when after three years, billions of pesos in illegal drugs are being smuggled into the country while the real drug lords still go scot-free?” De Lima asked. —Marlon Ramos

But SDET leader Senior Insp. Maynard Pascual, “upon seeing the resistance from the determined suspect and sensing their lives [were] in imminent danger,” shot Lumanlan.
Sison also fired at the suspect, said Senior Insp. Wilfredo Sangel, chief of investigation of the Pasay police.
Lumanlan was brought to Pasay City General Hospital where he died at 2:55 a.m. due to three gunshot wounds.
Recovered from him were his gun and several sachets of drugs, two of them containing “shabu” or crystal meth worth P6,000.
Sangel said that Lumanlan had a police record for his involvement in drugs and robbery-holdup cases. He was arrested in July 2017 on robbery charges although he was later released.

Francis Pangilinan again pushed for the mandatory autopsy of people who died under questionable circumstances.
Prevailing civil registry rules already require autopsies of those who died under questionable circumstances but Pangilinan’s proposal would make it a matter of law even if the next of kin waive an autopsy.

“The original purpose of this measure is to help investigate the increasing daily killings way back in 2017,” said Pangilinan, who had proposed a similar measure two years ago.
Under the bill, autopsies will be mandated for deaths resulting from the commission of crimes; deaths with an unidentifiable cause; deaths under suspicious circumstances; deaths occurring from violence or trauma; operative and perioperative deaths not readily explainable by prior disease; deaths where the body remains unidentified or unclaimed; deaths in prison or in police custody; and deaths of persons  to be cremated, buried at sea, or any other form that may render them unavailable to future examinations.FEATURED STORIES

A ranking military officer appealed for calm, saying investigators should be given enough time to ferret out the truth about the killings of the nine men during an antidrug operation by a team of policemen and soldiers.

Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, head of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division (ID) based in Maguindanao province, said the military was represented in the joint ceasefire committee which monitors compliance with a truce that formed part of a peace agreement between the MILF and the government.

The MILF, Sobejana said, sought the investigation.
MILF leaders had said they were lodging a protest against policemen and soldiers of the 6th ID who were involved in the drug raid that led to the killings of nine MILF members on Friday and Saturday in the village of Kilada here. 
Butch Malang, head of the MILF Coordinating Committee on the Cessation of Hostilities (CCCH), said the nine fatalities were disarmed then shot at close range.
But police said the slain men were drug suspects who fought it out during an antidrug operation that started on Friday and went on until the wee hours of Saturday.
Police said drugs and guns were seized although they could not declare the volume of confiscated drugs.
Chief Insp. Sunny Leoncito, Matalam police chief, said the raiding team was serving a search warrant issued by Judge Alandrex Betoya, of the Regional Trial Court Branch 16, on Dadting Kasan and Intan Aban, a female MILF member.
Leoncito said the police-military team was on its way to the village of Kilada, where Kasan and Aban lived, but was met with heavy gunfire.

An hourlong gunfight led to the wounding and subsequent death of seven suspects on Friday.
He said the team was forced to withdraw because of the superior firepower of the suspects and returned on Saturday when two more suspects were killed.
But Malang, in a letter to Mohagher Iqbal, chair of the MILF panel overseeing the implementation of the peace agreement, said the dead men belonged to the 105th base command of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (Biaf), the armed wing of the MILF.
‘Massacred’
Malang said the men had not fired but yielded their guns.
“After the Biaf troops were disarmed, they were deliberately shot by the operatives,” Malang said in the letter.
Von Al-Haq, Biaf spokesperson, said: “They were shot after they were disarmed when they could no more defend themselves,” said Al-Haq. “So, they were massacred.”
Malang said no drugs were recovered during the raid, contrary to the claim of police. —Edwin Fernandez

Dimalanta is among the latest victims in the Duterte administration’s bloody war on drugs which rages in poor communities like the back alleys of Sta. Cruz.
It has killed mostly male breadwinners, leaving behind what its critics call “a nation of widows and orphans.” 
No drug involvement
Police reports said Dimalanta shot at PO1 Evan Repil of the Sta. Cruz police station three times but missed, prompting the officers to fire back.
Felled by several bullets to the chest, he was rushed to the nearby Chinese General Hospital but died from his wounds.
Police said Dimalanta was a notorious drug peddler—a claim his grief-stricken family condemned as an “unbelievable lie.”
Michelle insisted that her partner was a loving husband and a doting dad.

“Even if we were neck-deep in debt he could never have done that, not ever,” she said. “I swear on my children, even if you cut his corpse open and test him for drugs.”
Twisting narrative
Barangay officials said Dimalanta had no previous criminal record.
Dimalanta was “kindhearted and generous,” swore his younger sister Vina.
On the day he died, she said, he even volunteered to help out fellow tricycle driver Marvin Rosario convey two female passengers.
Cemetery residents told a story different from the official police account.
They said two female strangers alighted at the far end of 2nd Street and then inexplicably walked back to where they came from.
Police officers in civilian clothes suddenly appeared and hauled two men to the edge of the cemetery.
One of the residents said he saw Dimalanta being forced into a narrow alley between tombs. “The police warned us to leave, so we ran like hell. We all heard at least 12 gunshots,” he said.
Police then hailed a passing tricycle to rush Dimalanta’s body to the hospital.


Rosario was also arrested and later detained at the Sta. Cruz station. But the spot report on his arrest did not say he was with Dimalanta during the shooting.
Instead, it said Rosario was arrested at 2 a.m. on June 15 at the cemetery for gambling and drug possession.
The Inquirer tried to reach out to the station commander, Supt. Julius Domingo, but was told he was out.
Humble, kindhearted
Because he only finished grade school, Dimalanta had been a tricycle driver for most of his life, Michelle said.
His parents separated and left with their new partners when he was still young, so he had to look after his two sisters.
Dimalanta’s four children — aged 5, 4, 2 and 10 months — all had asthma.
Michelle said he was also nursing a kidney ailment but spent his meager income on diapers and food.
“He was the type to skip meals and drive twice as long just to earn a little extra,” Dimalanta’s elder sister Joan said.
Underneath the hard work, however, was a breadwinner’s desperation and exhaustion, embodied in a brief note Dimalanta wrote on his cell phone two days before he died.


It read: “Lord, please help me. I don’t know what else to do. I can’t take it seeing my family suffer. I love them very much but I can’t do much more … I don’t wish to do evil.”
“It was so hard for him but he never wanted us to worry,” Michelle said. “Day after day, we both struggled to make ends meet … How can we now survive without him?”
No celebration
Dimalanta’s death cut short his promise to take his family out for a meal to celebrate Father’s Day, Michelle said.
They were supposed to go to Mass at Quiapo Church on Sunday to thank the Lord for healing the kids, who were all stricken with chicken pox last month.
“It’s his birthday,” his eldest daughter Alexa said, or so she thought. “We were going to eat out. I even have a gift for him, but it’s a secret.”
Her father is “dead,” she said, although she does not know what it means. “Mama said he won’t be back. But last night he told me to eat first.”
She misses her dad, something that Michelle knows she would have to reckon with when they bury him.
“It’s only going to get harder from now on,” Michelle said. “But we’re determined to fight. We’re sure Alex can’t rest until we bring him justice.”

Senior Insp. Wilfredo Sangel, head of the Pasay police investigation section, said that probers were looking at the alleged involvement in illegal drugs of Biscocho who was considered a “high-value target.”
“But we cannot make [any conclusions] yet since we just updated our drug watchlist and she may have been removed from [it],” he added. 
Successor is victim’s kin
Sangel said that investigators had ruled out politics since the newly elected barangay chief, Daniel Asuncion, was the victim’s nephew.
A hunt has been launched for the gunman who was caught on a closed-circuit TV camera passing through F.B. Harrison Street while escaping. He was described as 5’5” tall, of bulky build and dressed in a black shirt and denim jeans. He was also wearing a helmet and sunglasses.
Sangel said the suspect appeared to be left-handed.

Parojinog was the third town mayor killed in a police operation under President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody war on drugs.
The Parojinogs had appeared before then Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa in July 2016 after they were linked to Colanggo. 
The Parojinogs also handed over firearms for police custody after their licenses were revoked by the PNP.
The elder Parojinog denied the President’s allegation.
“I am not involved in illegal drugs. In fact, I am against it and I have been fighting it since I became mayor in 2001,” Parojinog said then.
The Parojinogs of Ozamiz are known to be the leaders of the Kuratong Baleleng crime syndicate, which grabbed national attention because of a string of brazen bank robberies, kidnappings and a sensational rubout case against ranking police officers until Reynaldo and his brother Renato ran for public office.

“That would be my worst nightmare — that my son would be forgotten,” Michelle told the Inquirer in a recent interview. “That’s why we pray that Aldrinne’s death would somehow be like Kian’s.”
A Grade 6 student, Pineda was hanging out with his friends at the Vitas slaughterhouse in Tondo, Manila, when he was shot by PO2 Omar Malinao of the Raxabago police station on the night of March 2. 
Malinao, who at that time was on duty against looters, had claimed he was running after a group of rowdy teenagers when he “tripped and accidentally pulled the trigger” of his 9mm firearm.
The lone “stray bullet” went through the boy’s stomach. He died eight hours later at Tondo Medical Center but not before telling his father that it was a policeman who had shot him.
Then came a twist in the case: It was later revealed that during the operation to remove the bullet in Pineda’s stomach, Dr. Sa-adi Sacar also took out his kidneys without his family’s consent, according to Michelle. The boy died the following day.
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) medico-legal officer Joseph Jimenez said that removing both kidneys when at least one was needed to survive was a “drastic move” that would require a “very good explanation” from Sacar.
No explanation from doctor

“I can only imagine what [Aldrinne] went through that night,” Michelle said. “He must have been in so much agony…maybe he might have lived were his kidneys not removed. The doctor did not even explain to us what he did.”
The family has since filed a formal complaint in the CHR, calling for an investigation of Sacar and another doctor, Timothy Jerome Venture, both of whom reportedly operated on Pineda.
Malinao, on the other hand, is facing two murder cases—one filed by the police in the Manila City Prosecutor’s Office; and the other filed by the CHR in the Office of the Ombudsman.
Hilda Clave, the Pinedas’ legal counsel, said that she would soon file a motion to withdraw the case in Manila to avoid being accused of forum shopping.
“We need to keep working on Aldrinne’s case. It’s the only way we know we can achieve justice,” Michelle said.
According to her, it was the knowledge that her son’s shooter was a policeman that made her family determined to pursue the case.
“Several people are trying to persuade us to reach a settlement with the Raxabago police. They say Aldrinne is already dead, that fighting back won’t bring him back. But I want [Malinao] to rot in jail. If he is free, he [may] do [what he did to my son] to other kids.”
“If [Sacar] is also liable for Aldrinne’s death, then he, too, must face the consequences. We were there, my grandson was fighting to live. He would have survived had the doctor made the right call,” Corazon, Pineda’s grandmother, added.
Fortunately, the Pineda family has found some allies, among them activist priest Flavie Villanueva and human rights movement Artikulo Trese. The group helped fund the boy’s hospital, funeral and legal expenses.
Systemic evil


Though Pineda was technically not a casualty of the war on drugs, Villanueva said that the boy was still a victim of “[systemic] evil,” empowered by a President who promised to exonerate policemen who kill.
The Pineda family sees a long and tough fight ahead but they remain hopeful. “At least [Kian] got the justice he deserved and the cops who killed him now face trial. As for us, we have yet to see the face of Aldrinne’s killer. Maybe, if we press harder, we, too, will have our day in court,” Corazon said.

Arrested were 142,069 people, including 217 elected officials, 48 uniformed personnel and 239 government employees.
The PNP and PCOO released the figures to also point out that the Duterte administration was winning the war on drugs. 
“However, despite the significant gains, many side issues and, to some extent, deliberate disinformation, continue to obscure the true picture of our antidrug operations often mislabeling the pure good intention of the campaign with human rights issues and political undertones,” said PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde.
‘Confused’
Rights group Karapatan on Monday said Malacañang was getting confused with its numbers game that it could no longer provide a consistent figure on its so-called successes in its drug war.
Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay cited the conflicting figures released by the PNP.
“Last December 2017, they reported at least 20,000 cases of individuals killed in the course of their antinarcotics campaign from July 1, 2016, to September 2017. Now, they have shaved off the figures to project a less murderous campaign,” she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


New York-based Human Rights Watch has estimated that more than 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers, mostly from poor families, have been killed since Mr. Duterte launched his war on drugs on July 1, 2016.
Human Rights Watch has estimated 4,000 people have been killed either by police or by “unidentified gunmen.”
Extrajudicial killings
Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV gave a far bigger number.
In February, Trillanes, citing figures in the administration’s 2017 year-end report, said the number of deaths and extrajudicial killings under the war on drugs had reached 20,322.
Among those killed in police operations and vigilante-style attacks from July 2016 to December 2017 were at least 74 minors, according to Children’s Legal Rights and Development Center.
A complaint has been filed against Mr. Duterte in the International Criminal Court accusing him of crimes against humanity in connection with his bloody war on drugs.
Albayalde said the Real Numbers Forum would allow the public “to see the complete picture of the national anti-illegal drugs situation in its true, unadulterated and objective state sans any biased opinion and emotional manipulation.”
He said the numbers would still go up because of the extent of the illegal drugs problem.
“There are only a few barangays that were cleared [of illegal drugs] as of this time,” he told reporters.


He pointed out that success in the drug war was “really difficult to quantify” and that it could only be measured by its effect on the country’s peace and order.
He cited a vast reduction on street-level drug dealers who openly sell shabu.
‘Relentless’
In a statement, Albayalde said: “PNP anti-illegal drug operations had been relentless and uncompromising throughout the entire period that we were given a new lease on waging this campaign with greater efficiency, and with fewer violent confrontations between law enforcers and offenders.”
He was referring to Malacañang’s decision in December last year to allow the PNP to help the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in the war on drugs.
Mr. Duterte took away his war on drugs from the PNP last October and designated instead the PDEA as the “sole agency” that would carry out operations against the narcotics trade amid criticisms of its methods.
Last December, Mr. Duterte ordered the PNP to actively support the PDEA in the war on drugs, noting that there was a “notable resurgence in illegal drugs.” —Reports from Jeannette I. Andrade, Melvin Gascon and Inquirer Research

Under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Acts of 2002 (Republic Act No. 9165), a drug dependent may voluntary submit himself to authorities for treatment and rehabilitation for a minimum period of six months.

The PNP’s Oplan Tokhang in 2016 led to a bloated number of drug surrenderers in the first months of the drug war, but PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Benigno Durana said that around a million of them would still have to undergo community-based drug rehabilitation programs.
In a forum with journalists and members of the academe held in Quezon City on Friday, Durana said that the “body count” – or the number of deaths related to police antidrug operations – was not a good way to measure the impact of the war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

According to Durana, the PNP is “continuously developing” the campaign against illegal drugs, which also calls for crafting and implementing recovery and wellness programs for drug users.
But the spokesperson said local government units and the civil society would also have to play big role in institutionalizing such activities. 
“Local government units also have to realize that law enforcement is not the solution to the problem on the war on drugs,” Durana said. “This is not a law enforcement problem, but the problem of the entire Filipino people. A lot more still needs to be done.”
He urged local government units and civil society organizations to help the PNP in advocating for rehabilitation programs and other institutional measures to ensure the reform of drug dependents.
During the forum, an independent study conducted by the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) also pointed out the staggering difference between the deaths resulting from anti-drug operations conducted by the PNP and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).
As recorded by CMFR, the PNP’s conduct of the first phase of the drug war resulted in more than 2,500 deaths.
But when PDEA took over the campaign on Oct. 17, 2017, the CMFR recorded only nine deaths resulting from antidrug operations.

But Durana dismissed the figures as “a matter of personnel size,” noting that since the police force far outnumbered PDEA, the number of killings in police operations would naturally be higher.
Durano also clarified that the 26,000 recorded homicide cases under investigation (HCUIs) did not represent the total number of drug war-related deaths.
Journalists pointed out that that the change of terms in PNP drug war reports – from extrajudicial killings to deaths under investigation and HCUIs – has brought confusion in media reporting and public understanding about the real figures in the drug war. /atm

In a resolution passed during its regular session on Tuesday, the council agreed to invite the city police chief for a briefing on the city’s peace and order situation.

The killings had caused “anxiety” among many residents, according to the resolution.
Tricycle driver 
On the same day the resolution was passed, an unidentified assailant shot dead tricycle driver Gerardo Mamarion Jr. at a variety store in the village of Ungka in Jaro District.
A former drug user, Mamarion died from gunshot wounds in the head and chest.
Four days earlier, on Sept. 7, two drug suspects were separately gunned down in the city.
Four unidentified assailants in two motorcycles shot dead Donn Azucena at the village of Calumpang in Molo District.
Azucena, 39, who had presented himself to police as a drug user, was waiting for a jeepney ride with his wife when he was repeatedly shot.

Motorcycle killers
Hours later, two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle repeatedly shot Rolando Puda at the village of Ingore in Lapaz District. He died at Western Visayas Medical Center from at least six bullet wounds.
The resolution was addressed to Senior Supt. Henry Biñas but Biñas was relieved from his post and reassigned to the regional police headquarters as part of a reshuffling of officers.
Senior Supt. Martin Defensor, the new city police chief, said he welcomed the invitation so he can present plans in solving the crimes.
Be alarmed
He said Chief Supt. John Bulalacao, Western Visayas police director, had already issued an order for police to solve the crimes.
Church leaders in Western Visayas had earlier raised alarm over the surge in the killing of drug suspects in police operations.
“Everybody should be alarmed,” said Msgr. Meliton Oso, executive director of Jaro Archdiocese Social Action Center.
He said the Church’s social action directors in Western Visayas “are alarmed at what is happening.”
He said while they support the war on drugs, they opposed summary executions.


Drug suspects were being killed in operations by police who were better armed and were trained to make arrests, he added.
“They could have maimed them if indeed the suspects attempted to fight back,” he said.
Antidrug police operations have led to the killing of six suspects in the last 10 days in Iloilo and Antique provinces.
At least 63 drug suspects had been killed in police operations in Western Visayas since July 2016.
More than 10 others have been killed by unidentified assailants.

Town mayors and their village heads should also take some of the blame for deaths in the government’s war on drugs.
Ateneo School of Government dean Ronald Mendoza said some local officials had enabled deadly encounters in their jurisdictions with some narcopoliticians ending up on law enforcers’ order of battle.

In his presentation during the “Media and the War on Drugs” forum of the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, Mendoza said the drug war should not be assessed only through body count, but also through local governance and environment.

Mendoza said local officials supported deadly antidrug operations in their areas at the start of the drug war because they wanted to get rewards from higher officials.
But this resulted in quelling criticism of the drug war and led to a culture of impunity that has since overtaken drug enforcers. 
However, there are also mayors and village heads who undertook measures to prevent killings in their jurisdictions, he said.
“We know a number of mayors who wanted to emphasize rehabilitation [and] partnered with the police, the Church, academic institutions and tried to protect their citizens [and] minimize the killings,” Mendoza said.
Mendoza said he conducted a study that suggested that deaths in the drug war were not really widespread but concentrated only in certain areas, like Quezon City, Caloocan and Manila in Metro Manila, and Bulacan, Cebu and Pampanga in the provinces.
For further study
But Mendoza stressed that the matter needed to be studied further, particularly the dynamics between mayors, barangay chairs and law enforcers as well as the conditions in their jurisdictions.

Barangay officials, for instance, were empowered to shape the drug war by identifying suspected drug users and dealers in their communities with the police, but there was no process identified to verify such information.
Mendoza urged mayors to take a more proactive approach by offering alternative measures to promote reform and prevent further deaths.

But the 4-year-old boy’s dreams perished when he was hit by a stray bullet inside his room around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, July 10.

The bullet that pierced his heart came from a gun used during a police antidrug operation near the boy’s house at Sitio Bato in Barangay Ermita.

“I had asked him to practice writing down his name. Yesterday was the first time he had written down his full name. I was very happy, but I did not know that [that day] was also his last,” said Skyler’s father, Marc Anthony, holding back tears.
According to Marc Anthony, he left the child with his wife, Gwynn, around 12 noon to buy spare parts for his motorcycle. 
Checking a pot session
“Had I known that this would happen, I would have brought him with me despite the weather. I deeply regret not doing so,” he said.
Senior Insp. John Kareen Escober, chief of the Carbon Police Station, said four of his men went to Sitio Bato on Tuesday afternoon to verify a report that a group of men was allegedly having a pot session in an abandoned house adjacent to the Abatayos’ home.
Escober said that when the policemen arrived at the abandoned house, they saw four men, two of them armed, having a pot session on the second floor.
When one of the surprised men drew his weapon, a policeman jumped at him and the two grappled for the gun, he said.

Escober said the bullet that killed the child came from the gun of the suspect, adding that not one of his men fired his service firearm.
The suspects escaped and the policemen failed to give chase, he said, without elaborating.
Neighbors’ version
But the Abatayos’ neighbors who were around during the shooting dismissed the policemen’s claim and said that no drug bust or chase happened.
“If it were true that the policemen and the suspects were grappling for the firearm, there should have been a commotion in the area. But there was none. It was very peaceful. What we saw was a policeman running behind Gwynn as she carried her blood-drenched child,” said a resident who sold banana cue near the Abatayos’ house.
A footage from Barangay Ermita’s closed-circuit television (CCTV) unit near the scene of the crime showed a policeman in civilian clothes carrying the child.
The neighbors believed that the policeman’s gun accidentally fired when he slipped and fell in the abandoned house.
A hole on the wooden wall of the room—left by the bullet that hit Skyler in the chest—was found about a foot from the floor of the second level of the house.
‘Hustisya’
Enraged residents of Sitio Bato are demanding justice for  Skyler’s senseless death.


On Wednesday, when the child’s coffin arrived in their sitio at 2 a.m., the residents lit candles on the road leading to the family’s home and chanted “hustisya” (justice) in unison.
They also initiated a signature campaign to urge the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7) to investigate the incident.
In their petition, the residents pointed out that the police also needed to ensure public safety during the conduct of peace-and-order operations.
A team of CHR-7 investigators submitted its initial report on Skyler’s death to the central office in Manila on Thursday.
“There were significant and material inconsistencies found by the probe team based on the public statements released by the police and the statements released by the witnesses. We will look into this during the formal hearing, which the CHR will set soon,” said lawyer Arvin Odron, director of CHR Central Visayas.
Members of the CHR Quick Reaction Team visited Sitio Bato on Wednesday and conducted forensic examination of the scene of the crime.
4 cops relieved
Odron said they would also subpoena Escober’s four men, all operatives of the Cebu City Police Station 5’s drug enforcement unit, to shed light on the shooting.
Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde had already ordered the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7) to relieve the four policemen.
Albayalde also assured Skyler’s family that “an impartial investigation by the PNP Internal Affairs Service is now being conducted in order to get to the bottom of this unfortunate incident.”


Although the four policemen tested negative for powder burns during a paraffin test, Albayalde said they were not yet off the hook.
Skyler’s mom Gwynn said she was not contented that the policemen had been relieved. The police, she said, should tell them what really happened.
Pa now tagged
The Abatayo couple also raised concern for their safety after Police Station 5 in Carbon belatedly tagged Marc Anthony as a drug personality.
Police said Marc Anthony was actually one of the four men who were having a pot session in the abandoned house raided by the policemen.
Marc Anthony said he feared that the police would use the allegations against him to force them to stop pursuing the case against his son’s killer.
“I’m afraid that they would use this drug allegation to eliminate me and make it appear that my son is the collateral damage for my wrongdoings,” Marc Anthony told Cebu Daily News on Friday.
“We only asked for justice for my son. Why do they have to make up stories about me?” he said.
NBI steps in
Marc Anthony insisted that he was neither a drug user nor a pusher despite residing in an area that police consider as a drop-off point for drugs. He said the barangay’s CCTV footage would prove that he was not in the area when the shooting occurred.


The footage showed that Marc Anthony left their house in his motorcycle at 12:15 p.m. Another footage showed him driving toward Panganiban Street in the barangay at 12:19 p.m.
Wary of the efforts of the city police to investigate the shooting, the Abatayo couple have already asked the National Bureau of Investigation to handle the case.
NBI agents visited the scene of the crime on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning to interview the neighbors and review the CCTV footage.

The list includes 67 mayors and seven congressmen.
Passing blame on gov’t 
Aquino told a news briefing that the killings of Bote and Lubigan were likely carried out by people “taking advantage” of the slaying of Halili to pass the blame on the government.
President Rodrigo Duterte has faced criticism from local and international human rights groups for his take-no-prisoners war on drugs.
Thousands of small-time drug users and pushers have been killed by police and unknown assailants since he launched the crackdown after taking office in 2016.
Later that year, Mr. Duterte disclosed a list of politicians allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade. Two mayors on that list had been killed in police raids and one had fled the country.
Last week’s killings drove  the country’s mayors and vice mayors to seek an audience with Mr. Duterte, but no meeting had been set with the leader who promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals and dump their bodies in Manila Bay to fatten the fish.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Asked whether the narcopoliticians were being targeted, Aquino replied: “I don’t think so. Otherwise, if that were the case, then a lot [more people] would already be dead.”
Not state-sponsored killings
“These assassins who have been planning to kill these [local executives], they’re doing it right now because it will project as if it’s a state-sponsored killing… We will get blamed when, in fact, they’re just taking advantage of the situation to do it,” he said.
“Who have been killed who was on the narcolist? It’s only Halili.  The other two—Bote and Lubigan—what’s surfacing is that they were politically motivated killings,” he said.
Police earlier said that investigators were looking at politics as a possible motive for the attack on Lubigan, as the vice mayor told people close to him the day before he was killed that he planned to run for mayor in next year’s midterm elections.
Investigators said business could be a motive for the killing on Bote, although they were not ruling out politics in the attack on the mayor.
Despite protest from Halili’s family, Aquino maintained that the PDEA based its findings on “a four-agency task force validating the real [situation] on the ground.”
The agencies, he said, are the PDEA, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines and National Intelligence Coordinating Agency.
Information on Halili
“All have information on Mayor Halili,” he said.


“[Halili was] connected with a drug group. We are investigating it deeper, although we already have identities of that drug group. And there are some linkages also to some politicians in Central Luzon,” Aquino said.
Of the 87 remaining on the list of narcopoliticians, Aquino said the PDEA had already “revalidated” the involvement in drugs of three—two congressmen and a mayor. —WITH REPORTS FROM JULIA ORNEDO AND ANDREA ALCARAZ

The government’s gains in the war on drugs come up yet again, a year after the President in his second State of the Nation Address (Sona) vowed to wage an unrelenting fight against narcotics.
Thousands killed 
Data released by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in March showed that 4,075 “drug-linked” people had been killed while 91,704 operations against illegal drugs had been carried out since President Duterte assumed office at the end of June 2016.
The Philippine National Police and Malacañang acknowledge 4,354 killings from July 1, 2016, to June 30, much lower than the 12,000 estimated by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Researchers from Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University have counted 5,021 deaths from May 2016 to September 2017. They presented their research to the public on June 25.
But no matter how unrelenting the campaign is, the CHR said, the government would not find a solution unless it deals with the cause of the problem—poverty.
Accusations that state forces are responsible for the thousands of killings have weakened the government’s supposed gains in campaign, the CHR said.

“Allegations of extrajudicial killings puts into doubt the credibility of police operations and is exacerbated by extreme proposals such as those coming from PDEA, which seeks mandatory drug testing of children, negating the best interest of the child rule,” De Guia said.
The government has repeatedly denied extrajudicial killings in the war on drugs.
“[D]espite the significant gains, many side issues and, to some extent, deliberate disinformation, continue to obscure the true picture of our antidrug operations, often mislabeling the pure good intention of the campaign with human rights issues and political undertones,” Director General Oscar Albayalde, chief of the Philippine National Police, said in a news conference at Camp Crame in Quezon City in May.
Cops charged
In April, after the European Parliament criticized the brutal  crackdown on narcotics, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the government had filed charges against police officers involved in unlawful killings.
Roque said the filing of charges was proof that “impunity doesn’t have a place in our society.”
The CHR is handling 1,129 cases of alleged human rights abuses related to the drug war, involving 1,395 victims, its records showed.
Of those cases, 614 involve alleged abuses during police operations, while 511 are so-called vigilante killings, of which about 90 percent are being investigated by the CHR on its own initiative. The rest have been initiated through formal complaints.
Ninety-five percent of the cases handled by the CHR involve killings, De Guia said.
‘Unprecedented’ record


While previous administrations had their own share of human rights complaints, the Duterte administration’s record of killings is “unprecedented,” she said.
“The commission has been trying its best to attend to each and every case of extrajudicial killing, but we were confronted with the size and scale that we struggle to cope with,” she added.
The prevailing “climate of fear” has also hobbled the CHR’s investigation of the drug war killings, with witnesses refusing to come forward.
For the HRW, the Duterte administration’s drug campaign is a “bogus war that has caused immeasurable misery among mostly poor Filipinos.”
The group, too, said the government failed in its objective of reducing the effects of the illegal drug menace.
“If we measure it by the government’s stated purpose of reducing demand, it is not entirely clear. If the drug war really worked, one would think the streets would be clear of drugs by now. But no,” HRW researcher Carlos Conde said.
Many questions
With the drug problem persisting even after the killing of more than 12,000 people in the campaign, Filipinos find themselves confronted with many questions, the HRW said.
“Are those deaths a measure of the drug war’s effectiveness? Only if the Duterte government considers the poor the problem, which it apparently does,” Conde said.
The HRW said that while the body count had decreased, the government had continued its  “antipoor” campaigns, such as  rounding up loiterers, and attacks against journalists, human rights advocates and religious leaders who “check Duterte’s abuse of power.”


“As the Duterte government enters its third year, what becomes as important as the body count is accountability, which remains zero. In this sense, things have only gotten worse,” it said.
If the effectiveness of the war on drugs is to be gauged through figures, the findings of the Commission on Audit on the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) are telling.
In its 2017 audit report, the COA said the DILG failed to fulfill the objectives of its main program against illegal drugs, the  Mamamayang Ayaw sa Anomalya, Mamamayang Ayaw sa Droga (Masa Masid).
P500-M budget
Launched in 2017, the Masa Masid program, aimed at increasing public awareness of drugs and corruption and encouraging community participation in solving these problems, was given a budget of P500 million for that year.
The DILG directed local governments to employ certain strategies in the fight against drugs: Demand reduction through advocacy and education campaigns; demand and supply reduction through information gathering and reporting; and community-based rehabilitation programs.
The bulk of the budget, P380.232 million, or 76.05 percent, was distributed to various regional offices from June to December 2017 for the conduct of training programs, COA records showed.
But according to the COA, Masa Masid failed to achieve its objectives due to the slow or nonimplementation of programmed activities.
Unused funds amounting to P88.689 million were hurriedly transferred for use by other agencies, it added.
“Based on the foregoing [findings], the nonimplementation of programmed activities and nonutilization of program funds were indicative that [the DILG] had not prepared a concrete plan for Masa Masid, which resulted in the no-attainment of the program’s objective[s],” the COA said.

In just two years, thousands have been killed in police operations and in attacks by motorcycle-riding gunmen. Most of the victims were from the poorest communities in Metro Manila.
Elusive justice 
The killings left thousands of grieving widows and orphans, for whom justice felt more and more elusive as months and years passed.
Despite her anger over her husband’s and her son’s deaths, Arsenia, 86, said seeking justice seemed futile.
“How can I get any justice? I have no idea who did this to them,” she said. “Maybe if I did, if I saw their faces, then I could go after them.”
But Remedillo did go after the killers. After Francisco and Marlon were shot, she ran after the gunman and was shocked to see five more masked men on motorbikes, acting as lookouts.
“I screamed at them and told them that I knew they were paid to kill,” she said. “But they just left.”

She was not afraid that the men would shoot her, too, she said. After all, they had already killed her family.
Mistaken identity
Remedillo said she knew that her adopted son used to take illegal drugs, influenced by his partner who had been jailed for peddling “shabu” (crystal meth).
Police records showed Marlon had on him two sachets of a substance believed to be shabu when he was killed.
“I knew he had already stopped using drugs. But my husband, he was mistaken for somebody else,” Remedillo said.
“I pray that my husband and my son watch over me. I leave their killers to God because there is nothing I can do now,” she said.
In 2016, Remedillo warned her husband not to vote for President Duterte “because you will die.”
Unheeded advice
She said she did not know why she had told him that, but something about the strongman from Davao City, who promised to fatten the fish in Manila Bay with the bodies of tens of thousands of drug users and peddlers, spooked her.
Francisco did not heed her advice. In May that year, he cast his vote for the President.


“My husband did not listen to me. Maybe if Duterte was not President, maybe he would still be alive,” Remedillo said.

Rasco said lawmen tried to present the warrant to the Cabantud brothers during an operation conducted past 2 a.m.

But two of the brothers “pulled handguns and fired at our troops that triggered a shootout,” Rasco said.
The brothers were initially wounded and rushed to a hospital in this town but were pronounced dead on arrival.
They were sons of incumbent village chair Bai Cabantud of Ambalgan village.
Recovered from the house of the Cabantuds were a .45-caliber pistol and one 9mm pistol with ammunition, nine sachets of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) and paraphernalia.
Rasco said the Cabantud brothers were on President Duterte’s drug list.

They were also on the list of high-value targets of the regional PDEA office, Rasco said.
Escaped
In a separate operation, also in the village of Ambalgan, police and PDEA agents were set to serve a search warrant on Moto, who was able to flee under cover of darkness as one of his companions traded shots with the law enforcement team.
Initially wounded during the gunfight was Ronnie Magon, described by police as a pusher working for Moto and also on Mr. Duterte’s drug list.
Police seized from him a homemade pistol and several sachets of crystal meth.
In yet another operation, Rasco said police were serving a search warrant on Lastimoso, who surrendered.
School official
In Midsayap, North Cotabato, police arrested the administrator of the school Great and Mighty Learning Center of Midsayap Inc. during the serving of a search warrant in relation to Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.
Rasco identified the suspect as Julius Caesar Dadiro Duque, who was arrested at 7 p.m. on Saturday inside the school compound in the village of Poblacion 4.
Recovered from Duque were four sachets of crystal meth and 48 empty sachets with meth residue.


Duque is now detained at the Midsayap police jail.
In earlier operations, nearly 40 people were arrested in separate operations throughout Southern Mindanao, according to police.
Drug den
The most arrests were made in Davao Oriental province, where at least 32 persons were caught in the act of using drugs at a den in the village of Central in Mati City.
In Davao City, P15,000 worth of crystal meth was seized from two suspects—Ariel Buhisan, 28, and Johndee Fred Pandili, 35—during a buy-bust operation in the village of 76-A, according to Chief Insp. Milgrace Driz, Southern Mindanao police spokesperson.
A report from the Davao Oriental police said a team of policemen, antinarcotics agents, soldiers and Coast Guard personnel swooped down on a community in the village of Central in Mati City to serve a search warrant on brothers Ricky and Raymond Matundo.
The two were arrested after the raiding team found in their house several sachets of crystal meth and unlicensed handguns.
Also arrested were at least 30 other persons near the house, which police said operated as a drug den.
In Tagum City, police also arrested four suspects during a raid in the village of Madaum. —With a report from Frinston Lim

In the back alleys of poor communities where the war on drugs is waged the fiercest, “nanlaban” bears a grim weight.
ADVERTISEMENT









It’s an official claim that the victim “resisted arrest” and engaged the police in a shootout. It’s a claim applied to thousands killed in the war, and whose families are hard-pressed to file charges.
But when Darwin Hamoy, 17, was killed along with three men in a purported buy-bust operation on Aug. 15, 2016, his mother, Mariza, and two other women took Batasan policemen to court.FEATURED STORIES
The suit is considered the first among the rare acts of defiance against this state-sponsored narrative.
Crucial to Mariza Hamoy’s fight and that of many others like her is the commitment of the legal community, which has been guiding the victims’ families in exploring legal options.


Whether the families choose to seek future reparation or to file suit, lawyers are helping them realize that “nanlaban” does not necessarily equate to helplessness.
Uphill battle
Using the money she pooled from mourners and gamblers at her son’s wake, Hamoy and two other women filed murder charges in the Office of the Ombudsman against 15 Station 6 policemen in September 2016.
Their commander, Supt. Leo Patay, is the alleged leader of the “Davao Boys.”
But on June 12, two years after they filed the case, Hamoy found herself abandoned by her two cocomplainants.
ADVERTISEMENT






One, Kathrina Polo, the lone eyewitness to the crime, filed an affidavit of desistance claiming that her husband, Cherwen, and the four others killed in the operation had shot it out with police.
Polo also denied being present when the killings occurred in her own house, and said the media had forced her to lie about the incident.
The third complainant, Marilyn Bordeos, refused to cooperate as well. Now only Hamoy’s case stands against the Station 6 cops.
“I was angry. When I saw them again, I couldn’t even speak. I just knew they had switched sides,” Hamoy says, “Win or lose, I’ll continue the case. You will never hear me giving up on it, even if I have to fight on my own.”
Hamoy’s case is now being handled by private firms Lente and Artikulo Tres, among the law groups that took up the challenge of helping the drug war survivors.
“The times are extraordinary so we need to respond,” says Lente director May Butoy.
“The demand of the times is for us to document [these cases] so [the survivors] can seek accountability later on.”
PURSUIT OF JUSTICE Mariza Hamoy, 44, is one of the three women who have filed murder raps against several Batasan policemen over their involvement in the death of her 17-year-old son, Darwin,whose photos she holds, in a buy-bust in August 2016. She insists that Darwin did not have a gun and that he was only buying cigarettes for one of the other victims, William Bordios,when he was shot. —KRIXIA SUBINGSUBING
In the two years since President Rodrigo Duterte declared his war on drugs, human rights groups estimate the death toll to be around 23,000 — mostly poor male breadwinners who were simply suspected of involvement in illegal drugs.
The impunity with which these extrajudicial killings (EJKs) are happening has led to a climate of fear, with most survivors refusing to press charges for fear of retribution.
The experience of “Lita,” who sought protection from the Diocese of Kalookan after her son, “Jose,” was shot dead by Caloocan police on Oct. 27, 2016, is illustrative. Four armed men had barged into the family home and even told Jose’s mother-in-law and child: Go upstairs, this won’t take long.
Jose was shot multiple times. But according to Lita, the police report stated that he had shot at the police during a buy-bust.


“I wanted to say, Why is your report like this? But police were everywhere. I was suddenly afraid they would shoot me on the spot,” Lita says. She has yet to press charges.
As early as 2016, with even the essential act of reporting a killing to authorities compromised, the Commission on Human Rights formed a network of eight law groups, including Lente, Artikulo Tres, Ateneo Human Rights Center, FLAG and CenterLaw, to focus on exploring legal remedies for EJK survivors.
With limited resources, the network began case management efforts in February 2017: processing affidavits, gathering evidence, conducting interviews with survivors and witnesses, and finding lawyers to handle the cases.
The network has identified three stages of human rights violations (HRVs) made in the context of the war on drugs: unsubstantiated drug watch lists, illegal arrests and EJKs.
The HRV cases also seemed to have a nexus with the evolution of the drug war, according to a member of a legal rights group in Quezon City.
At the start of the President’s term, when the antidrug campaign enjoyed immense popularity, most of the killings documented by the group occurred during police operations.
As the drug war came under scrutiny for alleged abuses, eventually the cases involved killings perpetrated by “masked vigilantes” or simple warrantless arrests, the lawyer says.
Most of the cases were based on hearsay, with little or no hard evidence and witnesses. Thus, lawyers willing to take on drug-related cases were few, making the filing of suits difficult.
What the network advocates instead is transitional justice. In partnership with the social ministry of parishes and other religious communities, this legal option involves future reckoning for survivors through the costing of reparations.
“The environment is not right to seek [the prosecution of suspects]. That’s how we see it now,” Lente’s Butoy says. “But the beauty of transitional justice is you’re looking not just at the victims but also at the families they left behind.”


Under this framework, legal groups document both the killing and the damage done in the aftermath: Did the children stop going to school? Did the mother suffer from depression? These constitute harm unrelated to the crime but worth some form of compensation under a reparations board, says Lente executive director Ona Caritos.
In the interim, the network seeks to provide for the families’ urgent needs, such as livelihood, scholarship and financial assistance.
For it to work, the lawyers must temper the survivors’ expectations while ultimately giving them the power to choose to demand prosecution now or in the future.
But prosecution is not an impossible choice, says Gil Aquino of CenterLaw, which led the two high-profile “Tokhang” cases in Payatas, Quezon City, and San Andres Bukid, Manila.
Both cases won landmark rulings in favor of the survivors and are considered “blueprints” of how drug-related cases should be handled.
It’s called strategic litigation: filing representative cases, though few, that “can bring results . . . [to] show that the justice system can work, and that there are victims who have some sense of justice,” Aquino says.
Championing the strongest cases can win precedence that will hopefully reverberate even to the low-profile cases, he adds. This can also encourage survivors like “Mercy” to file suit against police, as she did in March 2017 in the Office of the Ombudsman.
Assisted by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, Mercy brought murder charges against eight Caloocan cops accused of killing her husband and son inside their home at Barangay Bagong Barrio.
Despite her slim chances, she is “determined to make them feel that small people like us can still fight for our rights, that they can’t just take our lives away.”
“That’s representative justice,” Aquino says. “It gives people the idea that [you] just have to keep at it, because eventually there will be justice. But [you] have to ensure that cases are continuously being filed in the courts, to keep the policy in check.”
For the survivors to come forward, the legal community must have their back.


But most lawyers do not take up these cases because of fear of being tagged as drug protectors, conflicts of interest, or just “not feeling competent enough,” says June Ambrosio of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
She adds that the drug war has also led to sweeping changes in prosecuting drug cases under this administration. Gathering evidence for case buildup, for example, has become difficult.
The upsurge of drug cases and slim chances of prosecution have resulted in families likely to settle at the prosecutor’s level.
It doesn’t help that lawyers perceived as going against the government have become targets for harassment or even death threats, Aquino says.
“We can definitely do more [for the survivors],” says Ambrosio. “But we need to empower lawyers, capacitate them, . . . get [them] to step up and take a more proactive role in what’s happening.”
But every effort counts, and lawyers who are at the frontline need all the help they can get.

Paras’ seemingly paradoxical backing echoes that of millions of Filipinos, who polls say support the crackdown but not the thousands of slayings that are central to it.
The President’s drug war — his signature initiative — helped bring him to power in mid-2016, promising to rid society of narcotics by any means necessary. 
Since then, the Philippine National Police says officers has killed 4,854 alleged drug users or dealers in self-defense, while rights groups estimate the true toll is at least triple that.
According to the latest survey by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS), the campaign still has the backing of 78 percent of Filipinos, a figure undented in over a year.
Drug war proponents regularly point to these statistics as proof that the internationally condemned crackdown is the will of the people.
But those same polls show near unanimous agreement — 96 percent — among the nation in opposition to the killing, saying the suspects should be taken alive.
Backing turns into tragedy
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Experts say the President’s campaign has tapped into genuine popular outrage over disorder, crime and dysfunction in a developing nation with millions of poor people and a turbulent political past.
“It’s not like they’re turning a blind eye [to the killing] but they’re really worried about the drug problem,” said Steven Rood, a fellow in residence at SWS.
“It has been a problem for a long time and finally the President of the Philippines is doing something about it,” Rood added, describing how many Filipinos view the narcotics issue.
But for the family of Duterte voter Katherine Bautista, that belief was suddenly turned on its head by tragedy last year.
Bautista supported the crackdown until her stepson, John Jezreel David, was shot dead in what police said was an antidrug operation although she insisted John was not a drug user.
“I was even saying that the tears of families [of those killed] seemed fake. But when it happened to us, I felt the pain they were feeling,” Bautista told AFP.
“If it doesn’t happen to your family, you won’t wake up to the truth,” she added.
Lethal methods
A significant strand in the opposition to the killings is the fear a loved one could be slain just by being in the wrong place, not necessarily because of involvement in drugs.
“People feel very afraid that their families or their relatives might be placed in a situation where they could be the targets,” Randy David, a sociologist and a columnist for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, told AFP.


“But how can you possibly disagree or not lend support for a campaign to rid this country of illegal drugs?” David added, saying the lethal methods were what prompted questions.
There has been broader condemnation of the crackdown at home and abroad.
Rare protests were held in the Philippines last year following the deaths of teenagers, while outrage over alleged abuses has prompted the Preisdent to twice remove police from the front lines of the campaign — only to reinstate them, and promise to pardon officers convicted of murder.
The International Criminal Court has launched a preliminary examination into the killings, while rights groups say the President may be overseeing a crime against humanity.
‘My only sin’
Meanwhile, the President hammers the menace posed by drugs in near daily speeches in which he has described addicts as “not human.”
Analysts say the President uses clear and repeated messaging in an effort to buttress backing for his campaign.
“The way [the message] is delivered is that there is a very big threat, so first there’s the production of massive fear,” said Ateneo de Manila University psychology professor Cristina Montiel.
“Then [comes] the salvific message that this program or this leader is here to save you,” Montiel added. “That’s how popular support is produced.”
As the campaign continues, the death toll is well over Amnesty International’s count of 3,240 people killed during the nine years of martial law rule under dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the country’s darkest chapter since World War II.


The President recently addressed the thorny issue of the killings, delivering what critics called a clear admission they were suspect.
“What are my sins? Did I steal money? Even just P1? Did I prosecute somebody I sent to jail?” he asked in a speech in September. “My only sin is extrajudicial killings.”

Links to illegal activities
Before his retirement from the service in 2015, Sangco was linked to extortion and gun-running activities although Poklay said he did not know if the suspect had been charged in court. 
PDEA spokesperson Derrick Carreon identified Sangco as one of the high-value targets on President Duterte’s national watch list for suspected drug personalities.
According to the police report, Sangco pulled out a 9mm pistol after he “sensed” that he was transacting with a PDEA agent.
But he was not able to fire his gun because the agent shot him first.
Recovered from the scene were the suspect’s gun and at least 30 grams of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth).
On Sunday, a retired policeman, Supt. Roberto Palisoc, was shot dead inside a pedicab by unidentified motorcycle-riding gunmen in Malate, Manila.

Authorities said Palisoc, who was then with the Manila Police District Station 7’s antinarcotics division, opted for early retirement after his name appeared in the President’s “narco list” with other policemen, soldiers, politicians and judges in August 2016.
3rd kill in 2 days
Also on Sunday, SPO2 Rodolfo Cruz, another Manila policeman assigned at the special operations unit, was gunned down as he was leaving a cockpit arena at Barangay Dampalit in Malabon City.
It was unclear, however, whether Cruz had links to the drug trade, Malabon policemen said.
Sangco’s death came after the President’s warnings to have scalawag policemen, particularly those involved in drugs, “terminated,” saying he would not hesitate to make them his “project.”
“You can be very sure there will be a project for you and that is to neutralize or terminate you. If I would not do that, nothing will happen [in] this country if we are all bombarded (by) drugs, nobody (obeying) the law,” he said in a speech on July 31.

President Rodrigo Duterte drew harsh criticisms from a bishop, a senator and rights groups for separating human rights from people’s lives in his third State of the Nation Address (Sona), as he vowed to pursue a “relentless and chilling” war on drugs.
But another senator lauded the President for vowing to continue the antidrug campaign.

Reacting to the President’s statement that “your concern is human rights, mine is human lives,” which he directed at human rights groups, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David said it “implies that the victims of drug-related killings are not human lives!”
“Is not the right to life the most basic human right?” David asked in a Facebook post late Monday night.FEATURED STORIES

David, vice president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, said the President’s statement was “illogical” but not really surprising.
‘Focus on big suppliers’ 
Unlike David, Sen. Panfilo Lacson, chair of the Senate public order committee, was happy to hear that the President “is not relenting on the government’s war against illegal drugs.”
“Indeed, so much has yet to be accomplished, particularly its focus on big-time drug lords. It’s even reassuring that it remains on top of his agenda for the succeeding years of his presidency,” Lacson said.
David said the government should focus its fight against illegal drugs on big suppliers rather than on drug users.
“How come the supply of illegal drugs remains steady in spite of all the killings?” he said.
Sen. Francis Pangilinan said the antidrug campaign would not succeed as long as it kept on focusing on the killing of small fry and not on catching suppliers.

The President need not look far to see why this was not working, Pangilinan said.
The President’s own hometown continues to be plagued by illegal drugs, the senator added.
Scary
David said that while the President’s Sona was “relatively sober,” his warning that his drug war “will be as relentless and as chilling as on the day it began” was scary.
“It means we have to brace ourselves for more killings,” he lamented.
The Philippine National Police said 4,354 people had been killed in drug operations from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018, much lower than the 12,000 estimated by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW).
The PNP assured the public that there was no need to worry about the President’s statement on Monday on the drug campaign.
But HRW said respect for human rights and respect for human lives were not mutually exclusive.
“On the contrary, one reinforces the other,” said Carlos Conde, researcher of HRW’s Asia division.
Conde called out the President for “smearing” human rights defenders who were demanding that the government follow the rule of law.


‘Twisted logic’
In a statement, the rights advocacy group Karapatan said the President showed “twisted logic” in his Sona.
“Mr. Duterte is an insufferable psychopath who has developed a taste for killing poor people,” said Cristina Palabay, Karapatan secretary general.
Jose Maria Sison, founding chair of the Communist Party of the Philippines, called the President a “tyrant” when he declared that his bloody war on drugs would be relentless.
In a statement, Sison accused the President of promoting “the worst of criminality” among policemen, who are suspected of being behind the extrajudicial killings of drug suspects.
‘No distinction’
Lawyer Jacqueline de Guia, spokesperson for the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), said that while the agency was disappointed with the President’s vow to continue the brutal war on drugs, it lauded his focus on other aspects of life promoting human rights.
“We are supportive of all the rights he has urged Congress to advance while we remain steadfast that the campaign against drugs should not be at the expense of human lives,” said De Guia, chief of the CHR public affairs office.
The CHR cited the President’s pledge for government to give attention to other issues, including protection of migrant worker rights, the environment, peace, internal displacement, right to health and decent standard of living.
The President’s speech just demonstrated that there was no distinction between human rights and human lives, De Guia said in a statement. —REPORTS FROM TINA G. SANTOS, DJ YAP, LEILA SALAVERRIA, AIE BALAGTAS SEE, JEANNETTE I. ANDRADE, MELVIN GASCON, JAYMEE T. GAMIL AND DELFIN T. MALLARI JR.

Teenage victim Kian Loyd delos Santos’ last cry for help should serve as a constant call for justice on behalf of all victims of human rights abuses in the government’s war on drugs, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said on Friday.

She cited the results of an investigation by a CHR team which found out that contrary to police claims, Delos Santos, a 17-year old Grade 11 student, was actually pleading for mercy as he was picked up by policemen from his house in Caloocan City on Aug. 16 last year.
“Please stop it, sir. I have an exam tomorrow,” he was reported as telling his captors, as quoted from a CHR investigation report. 
De Guia expressed disgust that Delos Santos was killed by “police officers who [were] supposed to be the protectors of the people.”
“We owe it to the youth, especially to the innocent lives lost in the anti-drug operations, to fight for a society free of violence and abuse and one that truly upholds the dignity and rights of all,” she said.
Selective justice
While criminal and administrative cases had been filed against three police officers, others were not held to account. “Worse, [they were even] promoted,” she said.
De Guia called on the PNP leadership to ensure that they would bring to the fold of justice law enforcers who were involved in drug-related killings.

Meanwhile, the bodies of two men were found in Navotas around 5 a.m. of Nov. 5 — one along R10 and the other on Tanigue Street under the Sawata Bridge.
“Both had single (gunshot wounds) in the head, strangulation marks on their necks and cuff marks on their wrists,” David said. “One of them was later identified as Jimboy Opriasa, 35 years old, a resident of Gensan Street. Sangandaan, Caloocan. The other was Jovito Marquez Jr.,  23 years old, a resident of Malaya Street, Balut, Tondo.” 
Around 5 a.m. of Nov. 6, Rodel Manlapaz, 18, was shot and killed by unknown assailants at Letre, Malabon. Another man was wounded in the attack and was brought to the hospital.
Four attacks took place in Navotas in a span of two days.
On Nov. 9, Teofilo Francisco Jr., 33, was shot dead on Ablola Street, Tangos, Navotas. Gunmen also shot and killed Rannie Boy Barrot, 36, in an alley near Pescador II Street, near the NBBS Barangay Hall, later that day.
On Nov. 10, around 2 a.m., Ricardo Domingo, 32, was shot and killed on Bagong Kalsada, also in Tangos. Hours later, Christopher Boljoran, 24, was abducted on Champaca Street and then killed in a spot just outside the city’s fish port.
The bishop also said the family of Reymond Cerbito of Poblacion, Sta. Maria in Bulacan province, had sought the assistance of the diocese in locating the man, who went missing in April. At one point, he said, Cerbito’s loved ones looked for him in a morgue in Longos, Malabon.

David was one of the first Church leaders to strongly denounce the spate of killings of so-called drug personalities, almost all from the urban poor, either in police operations and vigilante-style attacks which critics say President Duterte has been encouraging since he assumed power in mid-2016.
In September, a Social Weather Stations survey showed that  8 out of 10 or 78 percent of Filipinos are satisfied with the administration’s campaign against narcotics.

ZAMBOANGA CITY — A police superintendent on President Rodrigo Duterte’s “narcolist” was killed in a shootout with law enforcers in a buy-bust operation in Dipolog City on Monday night, as the Philippine National Police regional office pressed its campaign to rid its ranks of officers with drug links.
Chief Insp. Helen Galvez, spokesperson for the police regional office here, identified the slain officer on Tuesday as Supt. Santiago Ylanan Rapiz, logistics chief of the Zamboanga del Norte police.

Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat, chief of the PNP Counter-Intelligence Task Force (CITF), which operates against rogue officers, said Rapiz was on a list of 6,000 suspected drug dealers compiled for the President’s war on drugs.
Rapiz was accused of protecting drug lords and engaging in narcotics dealing, Caramat said.FEATURED STORIES

Reward for police team
The President on Tuesday promised to reward the policemen who killed Rapiz with a trip to Hong Kong. 
He said he was open to converting the trip to cash.
Noting that Rapiz was a ranking officer, the President promised to reward policemen who would kill their superiors who were involved in the illegal drug trade.
He also reminded policemen that there was a P3-million reward for officers who could kill “ninja cops” — officers who sell confiscated illegal drugs.
Rapiz was selling P50,000 worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) to undercover agents from the CITF and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in Dipolog City on Monday night when he sensed that he had been caught in a buy-bust operation.
Galvez said Rapiz tried to escape, but he was cornered in front of the Andres Bonifacio College gym.

Shootout
“Instead of [surrendering], he drew his firearm and fired at the arresting [officers]. The [authorities] fired back, hitting him,” Galvez said.
Recovered from Rapiz was a plastic packet containing the shabu that he had tried to sell to the agents and a semiautomatic pistol.
He was taken to Corazon Aquino Hospital in Dipolog, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, Galvez said.
Chief Supt. Emmanuel Luis Licup, the PNP regional director, said Rapiz worked at the Western Visayas Police Office in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental province, before he was reassigned here in October 2016.
Crackdown on bad cops
Earlier, Licup announced an intensification of a campaign against police in the region with drug links.
He said 11 officers had been arrested in drug raids, while 31 others had tested positive for drugs.
Rapiz was the third policeman to be killed in the campaign.
Two other officers — PO3 Ronald Bernardo and PO2 Ma. Oliver Olaso, both members of the narcotics team of the Zamboanga City police — were killed in a shootout with undercover agents during a drug raid on Aug. 18.


Nearly 5,000 people have been killed in police operations since the President launched his brutal war on drugs in 2016.
Human rights groups claim the actual score is five times that figure and that the victims were mostly small-time drug users or peddlers gunned down by motorcycle-riding assailants, who are either hired guns working for the police or policemen themselves.
The PNP rejects that charge, saying the other killings were “deaths under investigation.” —With reports from Julie M. Aurelio and the wires

Their families claimed that their loved ones were victims of extrajudicial killings.
Pattern 
“Is it natural for a person who was alone, armed only with a ‘paltik’ (homemade gun) to shoot it out with several policemen armed with better firearms?” Zabella said.
“Without prejudging any investigation on the cases, it can be readily seen that there is that pattern similar to other situations involving arrests of drug suspects,” Zabella added.
But Supt. Reydante Ariza, Lucena City police chief, dismissed accusations of wrongdoing against local policemen.
“Their words against our words,” he said.
Councilor Rey Oliver Alejandrino urged police officers to submit to an independent investigation.

“Whether or not the victims resisted arrest and they were first to fire at policemen, the fact remained that they were killed by a superior force,” Alejandrino, a human rights lawyer, said in a separate statement.
Records of the Lucena police showed that five suspected drug pushers were slain in buy-bust operations in 2016, two in 2017, and 24 from January to the second week of November this year.
Same story
From Nov. 5 to 12, four men who had surrendered to authorities following the release of a government drug watch list were killed in police operations.
They were Roldan Laviña, 32, of Barangay Kanlurang Mayao (Nov. 12); Edilberto Jubac Jr., 33, of Ibabang Dupay (Nov. 8); Neil Arangoste, 28, of Dalahican (Nov. 7); and Ramil Moreno, 49, also of Dalahican (Nov. 5).
Police reports on these incidents carried the same story: “… instead of heeding the arresting officer, the suspect suddenly drew his revolver and fired [at] the poseur-buyer but missed, forcing the backup operative to retaliate resulting [in] the death of the suspect.”
Investigators, according to these reports, recovered .38-caliber revolvers, bullet casings, marked money supposedly used in drug transactions, and sachets of “shabu” (crystal meth) from the slain men.
‘Legitimate’
Geraldine, Moreno’s wife, said her husband, a fisherman, was killed in front of their house.
“When I saw him still gasping, I pleaded with the policeman to help me bring him to the hospital. But instead, one of them … shot him one more time and finished him off,” she said.


Arangoste was slain in his mother’s house by armed men who she presumed to be policemen in street clothes.
Ariza maintained that these police operations were “legitimate,” noting that the slain men, who he said were drug pushers, resisted arrest and tried to kill policemen.
Ariza said all information concerning activities of drug suspects were provided by barangay officials. “We don’t know the targets. But we were told that they were all armed and dangerous,” he said.

The IAS resolution also charged Supt. Lito Patay, former head of Station 6 of the Batasan police, with grave neglect of duty for “failing to prevent” the abuses committed by his men and which led to Hamoy’s killing.
Hamoy was killed with Cherwen Polo, William Bordeos, Sherwin Ternal and a certain “Rambo” in an Aug. 15, 2016, drug raid by the Station 6 policemen on the Polos’ house in the village of Payatas B. 
In September that year, their relatives—widows, Katrina Polo and Marlyn Bordeos, and mother Mariza Hamoy—challenged police claims before the PNP-IAS and the Office of the Ombudsman that the five victims had engaged police in a gunfight.
The women claimed that the five victims were at the Polos’ house to celebrate Cherwen’s birthday and that they were summarily executed by the team led by Pinero.
In a 10-page report approved on Oct. 17, the IAS said Hamoy’s “detailed narration of facts and circumstances, duly corroborated by Polo and Bordeos, is more convincing than the alibis of the policemen.”
Body in sack
This was a complete turnaround from a July 12 resolution from the Office of the Ombudsman, which ruled that the women’s testimonies “do not deserve credence,” since they were not present during the deadly police operation.

But the IAS ruled that there was sufficient evidence of treachery, which qualified the crime as murder.
It cited a forensic report on Hamoy, which found that he was shot in the lungs, as proof of the “gruesome and merciless killing.”
What the policemen did, the IAS resolution said, was “a clear transgression of established rules.”
It also held them accountable for placing Hamoy’s body in a sack and transporting it to Quezon City General Hospital, instead of letting forensics examiners process the crime scene.
“There is no doubt that they violated the norms of public service,” the IAS report said.
Command responsibility
The IAS also found Patay liable for command responsibility for letting Pinero, an SPO1, to lead the raid.
He was also taken to task for failing to punish his men.
Mariza, Hamoy’s mother, said she was not expecting the IAS to side with her.
“I feel stronger and more confident that this case would stand, and I could finally attain justice for my son,” she said.


Pinero, Pal, Timon, Maderable, Banggat and Molinos—all antidrug operatives—were named in a Pulitzer-winning Reuters report as members of the “Davao Boys,” a supposedly handpicked group of deadly operatives.
Patay, now Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief for Central Visayas, was their alleged leader.

SAN PEDRO CITY — A new round of simultaneous police operations left 11 people, most of them suspected to be involved in the illegal drug trade, dead over the last 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday in Laguna province.
But Senior Supt. Eleazar Matta, Laguna police director, said the number of fatalities was insignificant compared to the 187 people arrested for various offenses during the same period.

“We’ve proven the Sacleo (Simultaneous Anti-Criminality Law Enforcement) effective so we’d keep implementing it here,” Matta told the Inquirer by telephone on Tuesday.

Sacleo was a police campaign that replaced “Oplan Galugad” (search) and “One Time-Big Time” operations. Police carry out buy-bust operations and serve search and arrest warrants simultaneously across the province.
Earlier this month, 12 crime suspects were also killed in Laguna during a 24-hour operation. 
The campaign had reduced by half the province’s weekly crime volume to only 10 as recorded last week, Matta said.
“From an average of 20 to 25, we recorded only 10 last week. That’s an all-time low for Laguna,” he said.
Police reports showed that three drug suspects were killed in two separate buy-bust operations at Barangay Canlalay and Sto. Niño in Biñan City at 1:30 a.m. and 3:15 a.m. on Tuesday, respectively.
Also on Tuesday in Lumban town, a suspect, Francisco Padua alias Kid, was killed in a drug bust shortly after midnight at Barangay Balimbingan.
Padua was on the police watch list for suspected drug users. Recovered from him was a .38-caliber gun, police said.

Matta said all suspects died in “legitimate operations.”
In Kalayaan town, a suspect, identified only as Mike, was killed at 10:45 p.m. on Monday at Barangay Longos. The suspect reportedly shot an undercover agent, PO1 Mark Anthony Espiritu, when he realized it was a sting operation.
In Cavinti town, a suspect, identified only as Edwin, was killed in a buy-bust operation on the national highway at Barangay Lumot at 10:50 p.m. on Monday.
Edwin was accused of selling “shabu” (crystal meth) to residents in Barangay Lumot, West Talaongan and East Talaongan.
Drug delivery
In this city, a jeepney driver, Rodante Aragao, was killed in a drug bust at Barangay Landayan on Monday morning.
Supt. Giovannie Martinez, San Pedro police chief, said Aragao delivered drugs here during his trips from Pasay City in Metro Manila.
In Calamba City, Raul Alex was killed in a drug bust at Barangay San Cristobal at 2:30 a.m. on Monday, while a suspect, Roberto Paredes, was killed at Barangay Pooc in Sta. Rosa City at 11 p.m. on Sunday. Paredes was also included in the police watch list for illegal drug pushers.
In Cabuyao City, two men were killed when the police acted on a tip on a group of robbery suspects at Barangay Mamatid on Monday morning.
When the policemen approached, the suspects allegedly opened fire, forcing the lawmen to shoot back and kill them. —Maricar Cinco

LUCENA CITY—At least 97 percent of 183 drug-related deaths being investigated by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) happened in police operations in the region since January, a CHR official said.
Records sent by lawyer Rexford Guevarra, CHR regional director, on Wednesday showed that from January to Nov. 15, 178 cases were reported during antidrug operations conducted by policemen. Suspects in the remaining cases were unidentified, records showed.

“The number of drug-related killings this year [increased by] more than 300 percent … compared to last year’s figure,” Guevarra said in a telephone interview.
In 2016, only 24 drug-related killings during police operations were reported in the region. This jumped to 57 deaths the following year.FEATURED STORIES

Guevarra said most of the victims resisted arrest and engaged policemen in shootouts.
Laguna posted the highest number of drug-related killings with 60 cases followed by Cavite with 51. Batangas had 32 while Rizal and Quezon had 20 each. 
Formal complaint
Supt. Chitadel Gaoiran, spokesperson for the Calabarzon police, said all cases were presumed to be “legitimate police operations.”
“If there is any formal complaint, the regional office is open to any investigation,” she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
Gaoiran said the Philippine National Police had several avenues, for instance through its Internal Affairs Services, to investigate suspected extrajudicial killings where policemen were allegedly involved.
In an earlier interview, Supt. Reydante Ariza, Lucena City police chief, dismissed accusations of wrongdoing against local policemen.

Ariza stood by their reports and the legitimacy of their drug operations.
He said they were ready to face all investigations to clear their names.
Summary execution
Guevarra said the total number of drug-related killings and suspected summary executions perpetrated by policemen could be more than what their data showed.
He said their records were based on information provided by complainants seeking their office’s help and those reported by the media.
“We’re facing challenges in our investigation because the police were not giving us their official reports. So, how can we determine if it’s really ‘nanlaban’ (a slain suspect resisting arrest) or not?” he said.
More deaths
In Quezon province, suspected drug pushers, Christopher Supremo and Hilario Torres, were killed in a drug bust at Barangay Market View in Lucena City on Tuesday.
Ariza said Torres, when he sensed that he was dealing with undercover policemen, drew his .38-caliber revolver but it jammed when he tried to shoot a policeman. Supremo also drew his .45-caliber pistol and shot the policeman but missed.
Another policeman fired at the suspects, killing them instantly.


On Sunday night, suspected drug pusher Rhoderick Hugo was killed in another antidrug operation at Barangay 5, also in Lucena, when he resisted arrest.
But one of Hugo’s relatives dismissed the police’s version of the operation.
The relative said Hugo was kneeling, with his hands on his head, and was pleading for his life before he was shot.
“But the armed man in civilian clothes still shot and killed him,” the relative said.
A neighbor and the victim’s relative admitted that Hugo was a drug user and a “runner.”
“He was being asked by drug users to buy ‘shabu’ (crystal meth) for them in exchange for P50 or P100. But he was not the pusher,” the neighbor said.
The three latest victims brought to seven the total number of suspected drug pushers slain in police operations in Lucena City this month.
Lawyer Rodolfo Zabella Jr., president of Integrated Bar of the Philippines in Quezon province, said members of the group would meet this week to discuss ways to help the families of of those killed in the government’s drug war and find the truth about the killings. —With a report from Maricar Cinco

The tricycle driver’s father, Nestor Piagola Sr., is serving his sentence at the New Bilibid Prison for a drug offense.
As to the motive for the killing, Pablito said: “We cannot say it’s drug-related deeper unless investigation is conducted. What I know is his father Nestor Sr. is in Muntinlupa. He was convicted of a crime related to RA 9165 [the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act].” 
“He is a good man,” a relative of the victim, who refused to be identified, told the INQUIRER in Hiligaynon. “As a matter of fact he finished his rehab.”
Piagola is the second person killed by a motorcycle-riding men in a week in this city.
Last Nov. 20, retired SPO2 Rolando Alag was killed by men on a violet Yamaha Mio motorcycle.
Recovered at the crime scene were five empty shells, possibly from a .45-caliber pistol.
Piagola died on the spot with several gunshot wounds in his head and body.

Pablito is planning to request the city government and Land Transportation Office here to tighten their rules on motorcycles running without plate numbers.
He said would be hard to identify the perpetrators because they were using unregistered motorcycles.
“I will coordinate with the city and LTO to tighten the implementation of possible no plate no travel in the city,” Pablito said. “I am also contemplating to push that every motorcycles must be registered with the police so that it will be easy for us to find possible motorcycle used once its color, model and design is identified.”
He said, however, that this plan would face some opposition. /atm

Catholic priests and outspoken critics of the antidrug campaign Albert Alejo, Flavie Villanueva and Robert Reyes celebrated a Mass that called for the “restoration of peace, justice and dignity of human lives.”

“A person who is killed is not a mere number or statistic. Killing a person means ending his and his children’s dreams, his capacity to love, create and contribute to society,” Alejo said.
The candles lit by the mothers, wives and children of EJK victims should remind the government of its failure to protect and care for the poor and the vulnerable, Reyes said.FEATURED STORIES

Villanueva, an advocate for the education and rehabilitation of suspected drug personalities, offered prayers to “end the violation of human dignity of every Filipino and the followers of Christ.”
The priests said they hoped that EJK victims will never be forgotten whatever their number—30,000 according to  civil society groups or 5,000 as claimed by the police. 
Pwersa ng Pamayanan para sa Voluntarismo at Reporma, one of the civic groups that joined the vigil, said the drug war had turned into an “antipoor policy” that gives women an added burden as some of them succumb to depression.
“I hope the killings would stop because even small children are suffering,” said the widow of drug suspect Rolando Ocampo who was shot with two others by police in Barangay 19 in Manila on Oct. 11, 2017.  The police said the men had fought it out, but CCTV footage in the neighborhood indicated that they were executed.
The widow said she now had to take care of their three young kids by herself.

De Chavez was shot dead in what police described as an “armed encounter.”
Analyn said she even heard the gunshots but thought these came from fireworks set off from the nearby University of the Philippines Los Baños campus. 
Buy bust
“People here knew my husband. He was very kind, didn’t have any enemy. Isusubo na lang n’ya, ibibigay pa (He would share whatever little he had),” she said.
De Chavez, 41, a native of Sariaya town in Quezon province, was killed in a buy-bust operation led by the police.
Witnesses, among them residents on their way to school or work as it happened around 8 a.m., said armed men, some with their faces covered, chased down De Chavez from a convenience store at Barangay Masaya to a more secluded area where the supposed shootout took place.
Police cars and some unmarked vehicles then arrived and blocked the road on both ends to secure the scene.

Analyn said it took the police’s forensics team two hours to come, her husband’s bullet-riddled body left out in the open.
“My daughter (who returned from school) and I were pleading that we take him to the hospital. He could still be alive then,” she said.
Police said they recovered a .45-caliber gun, P800 cash and a sachet of “shabu” (crystal meth) stashed in a tiny purse.
‘Hit man’
But police maintained it was a legitimate operation.
Senior Supt. Eleazar Matta, Laguna provincial police director, said De Chavez was a “hit man” affiliated with two groups — Bahay Kubo, or Bantugon gun-for-hire syndicate that operated in the provinces of Laguna, Batangas and Quezon, and the Jason Hernandez drug group.
De Chavez was also allegedly behind at least 27 paid hits, either against politicians or drug pushers.
Analyn, a housewife, kept mum about the family’s source of income but denied that her husband was into illegal drugs.
“They had taken my husband away, but what my children saw and the lies they heard about their father, that’s what made it a torture,” she said.

The CHR recorded at least 368 drug-related deaths in the region from 2016 to Jan. 15 this year.
Laguna leads the provinces with the most number of cases at 139. It was followed by Cavite with 77, Batangas, 56, Quezon, 50, and Rizal, 46. 
Records showed that 279 died in antidrug operations conducted by the police. Suspects in 24 of these cases had yet to be identified, the CHR said.
But police reports from Jan. 15 to Feb. 18 this year showed that at least 21 more suspected drug users and traders, including two Chinese, were killed in the government’s drug war.
During this period, Laguna recorded 11 victims, while Quezon had four and Batangas and Cavite, three each.
On Feb. 3, Vincent Du Lim and Hong Li Wen, both Chinese, were killed in a drug bust conducted by government agents at a suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) warehouse in Tanza town, Cavite.
‘Nanlaban’

Police reports had described most of the slain suspects as “nanlaban,” or those who fought back and engaged policemen in gunfights.
CHR data showed that 32 suspects were killed in the drug war in 2016, when President Duterte assumed office. The figure reached 61 in 2017 and rose to 263 in 2018.
The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency reported that 5,104 had died in antidrug operations from July 1, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2018, nationwide, but human rights groups disputed the figure, saying the death toll was higher.
In Quezon, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines’ provincial chapter earlier offered legal assistance to families of drug war victims who wanted to pursue cases against the police.
But lawyer Rodolfo Zabella Jr., IBP chapter president in the province, said no one had sought help from their group.
Losing interest
Most families of the more than 40 drug war victims in Lucena City were no longer interested in filing complaints out of fear of possible retaliation from the suspects.
“Only those few killings reported in the media had been resolved after their killers were punished. The death of my relative was just part of the growing list of victims of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration,” said an uncle of one of the victims.
“Honestly, we’re all afraid of the possible retaliation by the killers. We just leave everything to God,” he added.

REYES
MANILA, Philippines — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said she intended to wrap up next year the preliminary examination of the allegations of crimes against humanity that President Rodrigo Duterte committed in his war on drugs, a move welcomed by the complainants who it saw as a “glimmer of hope” that he would be held liable for the thousands killed.
In a 77-page report on Thursday that included the Philippine case, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she had looked into the complaints that Mr. Duterte and other senior government officials “actively promoted and encouraged the killing of suspected or purported drug users and/or dealers.”

She said it was “in such context” that law enforcers and “unidentified assailants” had carried out thousands of killings throughout the country.
“During 2020, the Office (of the Prosecutor) will aim to finalize the preliminary examination in order to enable the prosecutor to reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines,” Bensouda said.FEATURED STORIES

Malacañang did not immediately respond to the Inquirer’s request for comment.
In a statement in February 2018, Bensouda emphasized that a preliminary examination was a process of examining available information to determine whether she should proceed with an investigation in accordance with the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC. 
A livid Mr. Duterte verbally attacked Bensouda and the ICC for acting on the complaint of crimes against humanity filed by lawyer Jude Josue Sabio in April 2017.
In August last year, a similar complaint was filed in the ICC by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) on behalf of the relatives of eight alleged victims of extrajudicial killings attributed to the President’s war on drugs.
“People are already inquiring and keenly awaiting an update on the case,” he added.
The Philippine National Police has reported that more than 6,600 have been killed since the antinarcotics campaign began on Mr. Duterte’s first day in office, but various local and international human rights groups say the death toll is in the tens of thousands.
For former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, one of the President’s arch critics, Bensouda’s report signaled that “justice is coming.”
ADVERTISEMENT
 


He urged PNP officers who carried out the drug killings to now decide “whether you would fall with Duterte on being liable for crimes against humanity or you would partly cleanse your crime by being a witness for the ICC prosecutors.”
“Now, let me point out the obvious,” he said. “As Duterte steps down from office in just a little over two years, he would not be able to protect you.”
“In fact, even Duterte won’t be able to protect himself,” Trillanes said.
Bensouda said the ICC “retains jurisdiction over alleged crimes that have occurred on the territory of the Philippines during the period when it was
a state party to the (Rome) Statute”— from Nov. 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, which was the day before the Duterte government withdrew from the treaty.
She noted that the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction was “not subject to any time limit,” or even if the country were “no longer a state party to the ICC.”
“It validates our view and repudiates the Duterte administration’s weak and erroneous position on the effectivity, jurisdiction and independence of the ICC on this matter as a parallel or alternative legal remedy when victims are running out of options to turn to,” Olalia said.
“Most importantly, it validates the fact that all these years, what we have endured are self-serving and self-righteous justifications for extrajudicial killings and other acts amounting to crimes against humanity,” he said.
The ICC prosecutor said her office used “open source information,” including news reports and official statements by the Philippine government,
in examining the actions of the President and other public officials.
“Open source information indicates that a limited number of investigations and prosecutions have been initiated (and, in some cases, completed) at the national level in respect of direct perpetrators of certain criminal conduct that allegedly took place in the context of, or connection to, the (drug war) campaign,” she said.
In assessing the complains, Bensouda said her office reached out to “relevant stakeholders” and met with members of civil society organizations.


“The office has also been following with concern reports of threats and other measures apparently taken against human rights defenders, including those who have criticized the [drug war],” she said.

Lt. Col. Lino Capellan, regional police spokesperson, said only 46 drug suspects were killed during police operations in 2019 compared to 154 slain in the previous year.

He attributed the decline to the “reduced number of drug
personalities who resisted arrest, or those who engaged police in a shootout.”
He also said the decline in number could indicate that “fewer people engaged in illegal drugs” amid the government’s aggressive anti-drug campaign.FEATURED STORIES

He claimed, however, that many of the 46 persons killed “resisted arrest.”
“No rubout, no extra-judicial killing, these were all legitimate law enforcement operations,” Capellan said on the number of people killed during police raids. 
He said police seized about P60.1 million worth of illegal drugs during the 1,528 operations conducted for the period.
A total of 7,887.26 grams of shabu and 5,615.05 grams of marijuana were recovered.
Brig. Gen. Alfred Corpus, PRO-12 regional director, also reported at least 60 illegal firearms and 17 explosives confiscated by the police last year.
Capellan also noted a 22-percent drop in the number of drug
personalities the police arrested during the period.
A total of 1,576 drug personalities were arrested in 2019 and
were eventually charged. He claimed that of those arrested, 1,141 were drug peddlers and 435 were users.

Gen. Debold Sinas, director of the National Capital Region Police Office (File Photo from NCRPO)
CEBU CITY, Philippines – The war on drugs in Central Visayas escalated when Major General Debold Sinas was its top policeman.
But his stint in the region was marred by the rise of unsolved killings of people linked to the illegal drugs trade, said lawyer Alvin Odron, director of the Commission on Human Rights in Central Visayas (CHR-7).

“He (Sinas) had a colorful stint here in the region. During his watch, the number of killings definitely increased,” he told the Inquirer over the phone.
Odron, however, was not able to provide the figures as his documents were left in his office. Sinas was director of the Central Visayas police from July 2018 to October 2019 before he was assigned at the National Capital Region Police Office.FEATURED STORIES

CHR-7 chief investigator Leo Villarino said Sinas would always be remembered as the police official who was firm in his decision not to give human rights investigators copies of police reports on the various killings in the region.
“While we appreciate his relentless campaign against illegal drugs in Central Visayas, there were just so many killings under his watch as police director here,” he said. 
“The CHR-7 is conducting an investigation on these killings although we failed to get the documents from the police,” he added.
Jaime Paglinawan of Bayan Muna Central Visayas described Sinas as a “severe human rights violator” when he was Central Visayas’ police director.
“Aside from several persons killed during his anti-drugs campaign, a number of farmers accused as members of the New People’s Army in Negros Oriental were also killed during his watch,” Paglinawan said.
“And his usual defense was these persons tried to shoot it out with the police. That’s how we remember him (Sinas),” he added.
Sinas had repeatedly explained that it was just normal for his men to protect themselves from unlawful aggression.

Soul mates
Their friends believed Charlie and her boyfriend, Airon Cruz, 28, were “soul mates” as both shared the same birthday, Sept. 30. The couple of no longer than 10 months died on the same day, in a shootout with policemen on Oct. 23. 
Police said Airon was the leader of a gun-for-hire group, responsible for killings in Cavite, among them the 2014 slaying of tabloid reporter Rubylita Garcia in Bacoor City.
Supt. Giovannie Martinez, city police chief, said a resident reported gun firing at Airon’s house at 4 a.m. When policemen arrived, Airon’s team allegedly fired at them, resulting in a shootout.
Girl’s plea
Aside from Airon, also killed was his brother, Arcy-Niño, 30. Their two other friends, Romeo “Jack” Bejerano, 28, and Jeffrey Dasig, 32, also died in the shootout.
Charlie had nine bullet wounds in the chest and buttocks. The four others had bullet wounds and bruises.

Police said Charlie held two grenades, but Liezel doubted this saying her daughter could not even hold a knife.
Based on their neighbors’ accounts, Liezel said Charlie was heard crying for help. “‘Tama na! Buntis ako’ (Enough! I’m pregnant,” their neighbors quoted Charlie as saying.
Airon and Arcy’s younger sister, Abigail, said neighbors also heard Charlie screaming: “‘Palabasin n’yo na lang ako’ (Just please let me leave).”
“Is this what you call ‘nanlaban’ (someone who fought back)? You see these jalousies? Not a single one of them was broken,” Abigail said.
CHR probe
Lawyer Jacqueline dela Peña, spokesperson for the Commission on Human Rights, said they dispatched on Wednesday a team to investigate the incident.
“We’d like to see if the police followed the manual of operations, the rules of engagement and if it were a reasonable, proportionate use of force,” she said.

Caloocan police officers blamed 17-year old Kian delos Santos for his death as well as the media and politicians for distorting the facts.
On Aug. 16, there were three other teenagers arrested besides Kian, according to separate counter-affidavits filed by Chief Insp. Amor Cerillo, commander of Police Community Precinct 7 in Caloocan City, and co-respondents PO3 Arnel G. Oares, PO1 Jeremias T. Pereda and PO1 Jerwin R. Cruz.

One of the teenagers, they said, was turned over to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), while the two others were turned over to barangay officials.
“Why is it important to mention about the three other minors arrested during ‘Oplan Galugad’ on Aug. 16, 2017?” the police officers said in their counter-affidavits. “It is very important to mention the three other minors because this proves that Kian Delos Santos is the fourth minor involved in ‘Oplan Galugad’ during that day and his death is an isolated case.”FEATURED STORIES

“Out of the four minors… it is only Kian Delos santos who ran away and worse engaged our police officers in a shootout,” read the counter-affidavits.
The police officers said the fact that three other minors were turned over to the DSWD and barangay officials showed that the officers involved in ‘Oplan Galugad’ were properly “educated and supervised.” 
The police officers are facing a complaint for murder and torture case. They attended Monday’s preliminary investigation and submitted their response to the murder and torture complaint.
They added that the media and the politicians blew the case out of proportion by twisting facts: “The media and the grandstanding politicians only twisted the incident involving Kian delos Santos by making it appear that there is a policy of killing in the PNP [Philippine National Police], but the truth is, there is none.”
“If only Kian Loyd delos Santos did not involve himself in the illegal drug activities, then he would not be involved in any ‘Oplan Galugad’ and he does not need to open fire at our patrolling police officers,” the counter-affidavit stated. “The problem is that the media and the grandstanding politicians pictured Kian delos Santos before the public as an innocent minor but the truth of the matter is that Kian Loyd Delos Santos is indeed a drug courier.”
According to the police officers, it is a fact that criminal syndicates use minors in perpetrating crimes.
They also maintained that it was an asset, not Kian, who was seen on a CCTV footage being dragged by the police officers.

They added that the complainants had no eyewitness to the actual killing of Kian.
An autopsy report showed that Kian sustained gunshot wounds to the back, behind his left ear, and inside his left ear.
But the police officers said location of the wound did not indicate treachery.
“Jurisprudence states that there can be treachery also even when the wounds are at the front,” they said.
The police officers sought the dismissal of the case against them.
The next preliminary investigation dates are Oct. 2 and 10.

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO — Bishop Pablo Virgilio David said night prayers have become his ritual since October last year when the Duterte administration’s war on illegal drugs claimed more lives in the cities of Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas, all part of the Diocese of Caloocan that he heads.
“I wake up in the middle of the night praying for dead people,” David shared during a reflection session with the laity in the Archdiocese of San Fernando in Pampanga, his home province, on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT







The forum, “Am I My Brother’s Keeper? The Church in Times of Crisis,” gathered more than 300 lay leaders.
Most extrajudicial killings in the diocese took place in slum communities where the Roman Catholic Church could not provide sanctuaries to people in distress, among them suspected drug users or pushers, David said.FEATURED STORIES

The diocese has so far established 27 parishes that serve more than 2 million people.
“We have a parish that is only 100 square meters [wide], which is smaller than a chapel in Pampanga,” David said. 
He said teenager Kian Loyd delos Santos was killed on Aug. 16, the feast of San Roque, patron saint of Caloocan, which reminded him that Filipinos were dealing with a “modern plague of addiction to illegal drugs.”
“The solution is extermination, like in the time of San Roque where sick people were burned alive inside forests,” David told his audience.
“And these days, it is risky to fight extermination,” he added.
“The call to us Christians is to stand for what is right, to show courage. This is about our faith, not politics,” he said.
David never mentioned President Duterte in his talk but he flashed on a screen the Chief Executive’s statement, “Maganda ’yan (It is good),” to have 32 drug suspects killed during simultaneous police operations in Bulacan province.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


David said the killings of teenagers have been described as “isolated cases.”
He then enumerated the killing of Carl Angelo Arnaiz, 19; Reynaldo de Guzman, 14; Nercy Galicio, 16; Anjay Suldao, 16; Alvin Preda, 19; Allan Lastimodo, 18; Irish Nhel Glorioso, 18; John dela Cruz, 16; Liezl Limit who was pregnant at 16; Troy Villanueva, 17; Joel Segovia, 15; Angelito Soriano, 16; Sonny Espinosa, 16; and Kenneth Lim, 20.
Most of the alleged executions were led by a “Bonnet Gang with tagaturo” (masked men guided by a snitch), he said.
Authorities claimed that those killed fought back although their wrists showed cuff marks. The victims were often left with two sachets of shabu (crystal meth) and a .38-caliber pistol.
“Children are getting used to violence,” said David, who showed a photograph of children staring at the bodies of suspected addicts.
David said the church set up the Salubong community-based drug rehabilitation program, offered sanctuaries to people in distress, and operated a child protection program “to deeply involve the diocese in the protection of lives.”
He said the diocese also put up mission stations in place of parishes in slums, offered prayers and rang church bells at 8 p.m. daily.

Over a year after he became one of the first casualties in the government’s bloody and controversial war on drugs, Jaypee Bertes lives on — in the son he had always wanted but never got to see.
On Sunday, Jaypee Jr. was baptized at a church in Manila with his mother, Harra Kazuo, and other family members in attendance. It was a double celebration as it was also the boy’s first birthday.

For Kazuo, it has been a long and grueling few months since the death of her partner, Bertes, and his father, Renato, while in the custody of the Pasay City police.
“I always ask myself: Am I up to this?” she told the Inquirer on Sunday. “I can’t really say how I have managed to face life’s challenges but I draw strength from my children.”FEATURED STORIES

Bertes, 28, and 47-year-old Renato were among the first casualties when President Rodrigo Duterte launched an all-out war on drugs right after he took office on June 30.
Shortly before midnight on July 6, 2016, police offiers barged into Bertes’ house, a tiny room in the slums of Pasay City, and demanded that he show them where the “shabu” was hidden. 
Lawmen shoved aside Kazuo, who was then five months pregnant with Jaypee Jr., as they ransacked the house. Even her six-year-old daughter was not spared as a policeman lifted her diaper to check for contraband.
The police took Bertes with them and his father, fearing that something bad would happen to his son, insisted on accompanying him to Station 4.
The next day, Kazuo visited the pair and saw signs that they had been beaten in the few hours they were in detention.
Hours later, Bertes and Renato would wind up dead after they reportedly tried to grab the guns of PO2 Alipio Balo Jr. and PO1 Michael Tomas.
Kazuo admitted that her partner had used drugs occasionally and even sold shabu to make a little money on the side.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


But all of that changed when Bertes learned that he was going to have a son. “He promised to change. He said he didn’t want to die because he was going to become a father again,” she added.
The police, on the other hand, have a different version of events.
They said they chanced upon Bertes and his father gambling in the neighborhood and took the pair to the police station after drugs were found in their possession.
While in detention, father and son tried to get a police officer’s gun and they were shot as a result.
Lawyer Frederick Mikhail Farolan who represents Kazuo said that the murder case remains pending in a Pasay City court while the two policemen have gone into hiding.
Kazuo told the Inquirer that she and her husband initially wanted to name their son “Prince Ezekiel” which means “God strengthens.” But after Bertes died, Kazuo found it fitting to name her youngest after him.
“Every single day, I show him photos of his father and he calls out, ‘Papa, Papa.’ I tell him everything about his father and I tell him that I’m sorry that he couldn’t be here to guide him because he was taken away so early from us,” she said.
She will tell him of his father’s fate when he comes of age. But for “Anna,” their four-year-old daughter, her papa is just asleep, Kazuo said.
As she testified in the Senate hearings on extrajudicial killings in November 2016, the single mother became the face of grieving widows in the drug war. But behind the brave front was the constant fear for her life and her children.
“But if you know that you are on the side of truth, then you should continue fighting,” Kazuo said.


Despite the pain, she stressed that she has already forgiven the men who took her partner from her. “But I don’t think I am ready to heal just yet… To me, everything feels like it all just happened yesterday,” she said.
“For my son Jaypee, I want him to inherit my husband’s great way with dealing with people,” she told the Inquirer, adding: “But more than anything, I want him to grow up to be a good person.”

She said she didn’t know at first that it was her son who was the target.
Brondial’s 17-year-old sister said she heard him begging for his life: “I heard him ask the gunman not to shoot him because he had done nothing wrong. But the gunman hit him on the head with the gun and then shot him.” 
According to Rosanna, her son was not a drug addict. “He was addicted only to computer games and basketball. Isn’t that normal for a child?” she asked.
The Pasay police chief said that investigators were considering two angles in the “peculiar case” — vengeance and mistaken identity.
Senior Supt. Dionisio Bartolome told the Inquirer that a witness, Jorge Baladjia, had claimed that Gary Alandra was the “real target.”
Alandra, according to barangay officials, was on the drug watch list while his family had a reputation for being involved in illegal drugs.
Baladjia said that minutes before the shooting took place, he was talking to Alandra who later left.

Baladjia said that after several minutes, Brondial approached him and they started talking. At this point, a man on a motorcycle stopped in front of the victim and shot him.
Barangay 104 watchman Tony Bacsal said that the killer could have mistaken Brondial for Alandra as both were of the same height.
The two were also skinny, sported blonde hair and wore only navy blue shorts at the time of the shooting.
As for the vengeance angle, Bartolome reported that they found out that Jayson Brondial, the leader of a robbery group who was killed in a police operation in Makati in February 2016, was the victim’s older brother.
Another sibling, Jerry Brondial, was earlier arrested in Cavite on robbery and drug charges.
“We are looking at the possibility that other individuals such as their victims are exacting vengeance on the family,” Bartolome said.
The Pasay police have created a special investigation team composed of nine lawmen to look into the case.
Rosanna, meanwhile, had a message for the killer: “I hope his conscience bothers him. He didn’t even stop to think whether he was shooting a child or an adult.”

Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, the district director, said that since July 2016 each barangay had been encouraged to put up drop boxes to gather information on crime and illegal drugs from residents. But it was only this September that a “standard design” was finally agreed upon.
Earlier media reports about the project simply described it as the “Drug Box” — since its markings encouraged residents, rather bluntly, to “drop here names of suspected illegal pushers/users.”FEATURED STORIES

Each barangay then was left to improvise on how its box would look like. Barangay Valencia, for example, came up with a rectangular one made of wood.
But today, the 12-cubic-inch receptacle is formally called the “Oplan Tokhang Suggestions and Complaints Drop Box.” 
It sports the various logos of officialdom: the QCPD, the city government, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Dangerous Drugs Board.
Eleazar said the boxes are there to encourage not just tips on criminals but also complaints against his own men. He stressed that he would be open to investigate QCPD members who would commit abuses under the Duterte administration’s intensified campaign against illegal drugs.
In July, the initiative came under fire from human rights groups and other critics who feared that the crowd-sourced information on alleged drug users or pushers could be used to draw up a “hit list” for vigilante-style attacks or questionable police operations.
But Eleazar assured detractors that all information obtained through the boxes would still be validated.
“We are encouraging community participation,” he stressed in an interview on Saturday. “We need intelligence monitoring and the residents themselves know the people in their neighborhood.”

“The information gathered would only be for case buildup,” he said. “If we don’t have evidence, we cannot make an arrest.”
He pointed out that the written tips coursed through the boxes would be considered no different from those received by the PNP through its text hotline.
“There are still tipsters out there who have no cell phones. This is about giving a chance to others,” he added.
In a way, the QCPD project is serving as the model that other cities and towns are now supposed to follow. It was implemented ahead of a recent DILG order for local government units nationwide to have similar initiatives under a program dubbed “Masa Masid” (or Mamamayang Ayaw sa Anomalya, Mamamayang Ayaw sa Droga).
A DILG memorandum issued in August, which revised the guidelines for Masa Masid, called for the setup of drop boxes as a means for citizens to report crime, illegal drugs, corruption and other threats to peace and security.
The memo even prescribed the proper procedures when opening a box and examining the contents. At least six members of a technical working committee should be present to witness it.
In Quezon City, the proposal is to open the boxes at 4 p.m. every Thursday, the Inquirer learned.
A police officer, who holds the key to the box as the designated “focal person” in a barangay, will unlock it in the presence of barangay officials and representatives from the Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse and Advisory Council (BADAC), the Liga ng mga Barangay, faith-based organizations, and civil society groups.
The representatives would also be in charge of monitoring the reporting system, as well as the segregation and assessment of information and its referral to concerned government agencies, including the PNP and the Office of the Ombudsman.
Eleazar said the boxes would be supplied by the QCPD. The barangays may place their orders at P2,000 per box, the money drawn from their BADAC funds.


The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL), however, continued to warn against the project as a “dangerous shortcut” in the fight against drugs and crime.
NUPL president Edre Olalia said having such boxes would have a chilling effect in communities where the police as “Big Brother” would be spawning “many Little Brothers” among the neighbors.
“It would only stoke intrigue and suspicion among residents,” he said in an interview. “Instead of unifying the people against the drug problem in a legal, scientific and holistic way, you divide and polarize them.”
“I don’t see it as justifiable, particularly within the framework of the drug war,” said Olalia, adding that he had never seen anything like it done in other countries.
The QCPD should instead stick to “good, old-fashioned police work that is scientific, systematic and credible” in building cases, the lawyer stressed.
“The state has all the resources, whether human or material resources, to conduct credible and reliable police work to pursue investigation and intelligence without crossing over the line of human rights violations,” he said.

Update
Three out of five Filipinos believe that only the poor get killed in the government’s deadly war on drugs, according to a survey conducted by the Social Weather Station (SWS) from June 23 to 26.

For his part, Philippine National Police Chief Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa conceded that most of those killed in the drug campaign were from the slums but said they were not the only targets of authorities.
The survey results show that 60 percent of Filipinos agree to the statement: “Hindi pinapatay ang mga mayayaman na drug pusher; ang mga pinapatay ay ang mahihirap lamang [Rich drug pushers are not killed; only the poor ones are killed].”FEATURED STORIES

On the other hand, 23 percent disagree – of which 12 percent somewhat disagree and 11 percent strongly disagree – and 17 percent were undecided.
Most of those who share the sentiment came from Metro Manila, with 75 percent agreeing. This is followed by Mindanao with 59 percent agreeing, balance Luzon with 58 percent, and the Visayas with 53 percent. 
The poll results came days after the SWS revealed that most Filipinos do not buy police’s claim that those killed under President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs had fought against the authorities.
The nationwide survey was conducted on 1,200 respondents with a margin of error of plus-or-minus three percentage points.
Three quarters of those surveyed also believe that Duterte should expose his list of drug personalities and charge them in court.
The survey found that 74 percent agree with the statement: “Dapat isiwalat ni Pang. Duterte ang kanyang listahan ng mga taong sangkot sa droga o “drug personalities” sa publiko at sampahan ng kaso sa korte ang mga nakalista. [Pres. Duterte should expose his list of drug personalities to the public and charge those in the list in court],” while 12 percent disagree and 14 are undecided.
This sentiment is highest among Metro Manila residents with 82 percent, followed by balance Luzon at 75 percent, Mindanao at 71 percent, and the Visayas at 69 percent.

In a statement, the SWS said “items on the administration’s campaign against illegal drugs are non-commissioned. They were included on SWS’s own initiative and released as a public service.”
PNP chief: Poor not only targets
In reaction, Dela Rosa said: “Well, the survey is still the perception of the people.”
Dela Rosa pointed out that the police had neutralized big time drug personalities, namely Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog and Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. in the anti-narcotics drive.
“Were those men poor? Certainly not,” the PNP chief said, adding that people should exercise fairness before commenting on the police anti-drug operations.
“Totoo naman talaga (It’s true). Mas maraming mahirap ang nagbebenta ng droga kaysa sa mayaman kasi (Those selling drugs were mostly poor people) you have to understand the structure of the drug pyramid,” he explained.
The PNP chief said the killings would only stop when the drug suspects would no longer resist authorities.
“Kung walang lumalaban, walang mamamatay. Hangga’t merong lalaban, talagang may mamamatay,” Dela Rosa said.

TAGBILARAN CITY, Bohol — Police officers killed a dismissed fellow enforcer in a buy-bust operation in Talibon town past 9 a.m. on Wednesday.
They identified the fatality as Edgardo Bunado, alias Ega, a 47-year-old former police officer 2.

Bunado had come to be considered as a high-value target in the campaign against illegal drugs in Bohol, according to Senior Insp. Jojit Mananquil of the Provincial Intelligence Branch (PIB) of the Bohol Provincial Police Office (BPPO).

Based on surveillance done by the police and Provincial Drug Enforcement Unit, Bunado was selling refreshment drinks in the town but it turned out that he was also allegedly peddling crystal meth, locally known as shabu.
On learning this, the police conducted a buy-bust operation against Bunado on Wednesday morning in Purok 1, Barangay San Isidro, Talibon town. 
When Bunado sensed that he was transacting with a police officer posing as a buyer, he immediately draw his firearm from his waist but he was shot first by the operating team.
“The suspect sensed that it was an entrapment. So he got his firearm to fire us. We were then prompted to retaliate to prevent him from harming the lawmen,” Mananquil said.
He was taken to Talibon District Hospital but he was declared dead on arrival by Dr. Vidal Manga.
Hospital staff recovered a P500 bill used as marked money, nine pieces medium-sized sachets shabu, and 14 small plastic sachets of shabu worth P472,000, and different cash denominations. They turned these over to the PIB.

The United States, Canada and Australia, three of the Philippines’ major trading partners and political allies, have joined 36 other nations in mounting international pressure on Manila to end the killings and the growing culture of impunity in President Duterte’s brutal antinarcotics campaign.
In a move that could rile the President, the 39 countries signed a joint statement calling on the Duterte administration to uphold the “universal principles of democratic accountability and the rule of law” in resolving the thousands of killings in his war on drugs.

More than 3,800 people have been killed by the police in antidrug operations since last year. Thousands of others were killed by unknown assailants suspected to be working with the authorities.
Responding to the statement, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the government would be happy to accept foreign assistance in ridding the country of the “scourges of drugs, corruption and criminality,” but it would never allow other nations to dictate how it should handle its internal affairs.FEATURED STORIES

In Washington, where he recently met US State Secretary Rex W. Tillerson, Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said the joint statement was “biased and based on questionable information.”
“It is very unfortunate that instead of engaging us constructively, some western countries would rather criticize and impose conditions as if they can do a better job than the government in protecting the Filipino people,” Cayetano said. 
The Philippine Mission to the UN also assailed the statement, describing it as “sweeping and politicized.”
Pursue investigations
In their statement, which was delivered by Iceland at the 36th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva on Thursday, the 39 countries urged the  government “to take all necessary measures to bring these killings to an end and cooperate with the international community to pursue appropriate investigations into these incidents.”
“We remain concerned about the thousands of killings and climate of impunity associated with the war on drugs, and note recent stated commitments to observe due process in investigating these crimes,” the statement said.
The 39 countries, which also included France, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, wanted the Duterte government to allow UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, to visit the Philippines without preconditions or limitations.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Mr. Duterte had repeatedly verbally attacked and cussed at Callamard for expressing her views on the country’s worsening human rights situation since he took office in June 2016.
Duty bound
The 39 countries reminded the Philippines that it was duty bound to observe the “highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” as a member of the UNHRC and called on Manila to investigate alleged human rights violations and “create a safe and secure environment for indigenous communities, journalists and HRDs (human rights defenders).”
In a speech he delivered in November last year, the President had threatened to kill human rights advocates critical of his take-no-prisoner strategy against the illegal drug trade.
He also warned he would order the bombing of lumad schools in Mindanao for allegedly teaching their students to “rebel against the government.”
Address violations
The joint statement expressed regrets that the government rejected 154 of 257 recommendations “necessary to address serious human rights violations,” which were presented during UNHRC’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the country’s human rights situation this year.
Abella said the UNHRC “unanimously accepted and commended” the Outcome Report on the Philippines at the UPR, but lamented that “some parties refuse to understand certain aspects of our human rights efforts.”
The government is committed to protect its citizens from drugs, corruption and criminality, he said.
“To achieve these ends, we will always be happy to accept the help of our foreign friends. But we will never accept dictation on how we are managing our own internal domestic processes,” he said in a statement.


Culture of impunity
Abella denied that a culture of impunity exists in the Philippines, saying the country’s justice system “does not tolerate any state-sponsored extrajudicial killings.”
“So let us be clear. There is no culture of impunity in the Philippines,” Abella said.
He said all “credible allegations” of human rights violations were under investigation following the Constitution and the laws of the land and “in compliance with the spirit of our national traditions of liberty and democracy.”
He said claims of extrajudicial killings and alleged circumvention of police procedures should be proven in court. “Failing these, such claims are mere hearsay,” he said.
Maria Teresa Almojuela, deputy head of the Philippine mission in Geneva, criticized the mostly Western countries that signed the statement for instigating wars that have killed thousands.
“It is ironic that many states joining the statement are the very same states that are the sources of arms, bombs, machines and mercenaries that maim, kill and massacre thousands of people all over the world, not only during their colonial past, but even up to today,” she said.
Independent investigation
Human rights activists welcomed the joint statement and called for an independent investigation of the killings.
“The Philippines has so far shown itself unwilling to heed the calls to end this murderous campaign and hold those responsible to account,” John Fisher, Geneva director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a statement late on Thursday.


Fisher said the UNHRC body should intervene and exercise its authority “to end the violence, support an international investigation into the deaths and demand accountability for all unlawful killings.”
Ellecer Carlos, of the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, said: “We appreciate the international solidarity against the deteriorating human rights situation in the Philippines, especially at a time when human rights defenders are vilified and threatened for the work that we do.” —WITH REPORTS FROM JHOANNA BALLARAN, NESTOR CORRALES AND THE WIRES

Two witnesses to the killing of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz told a Senate inquiry on Monday that the boy was on his knees when he was shot and that the shooters were police officers, but differed on the time the shooting happened.
Appearing at the third hearing called by the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, taxi driver Tomas Bagcal said he saw two police officers shoot Arnaiz at past 4 a.m. while another witness who gave his name as Joe Daniel said the shooting happened at 2 a.m. on Aug. 18.

Both witnesses, however, attested that Arnaiz did not die in a gunfight with police but was killed in cold blood.
“The question now is that they have different times (of the incident) but they saw the same thing,” Sen. Panfilo Lacson, the committee chair, told reporters after the hearing.FEATURED STORIES

Lacson said the Department of Justice (DOJ) should look into who between the two witnesses was telling the truth, and suggested authorities conduct a reenactment of the shooting based on their accounts.
He said the different times given by the two witnesses as well as the conflicting findings of the police and the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) on the entry and exit wounds of Arnaiz and the controversy about whether the body found in a creek in Nueva Ecija province was that of Arnaiz’s companion, 14-year-old Reynaldo de Guzman, could affect the case of government prosecutors. 
“It’s almost sure that there will be a finding of probable cause [against the Caloocan police officers] and the filing of information, but the question is, will this pass the test of guilty beyond reasonable doubt,” Lacson said.
At the hearing, Bagcal, on questioning by Sen. Grace Poe, said two boys boarded his cab after midnight on Aug. 18 in Pasig City and asked to be taken to 5th Avenue in Caloocan.
He said the older boy declared a holdup when they reached their destination.
Bagcal said the boy pulled out a knife but he managed to parry the attack.
He said a tricycle driver in the area helped him subdue his assailant and they took the two boys to the police station on 9th Avenue.

Bagcal said a police officer at the station later told him they would kill the two boys who held him up but he insisted he just wanted to turn the two in.
He said a police officer who identified himself as Sir Lakay told him they would leave the precinct. He said he went to his cab to leave the premises.
It was then, he said, that Sir Lakay asked him whether he wanted the number of holdup men to be reduced.
He said they went back to the precinct and later he heard Sir Lakay give orders to bring the two boys to a patrol car.
But the boys and another police officer boarded his cab and they all headed toward Dagat-Dagatan accompanied by three police officers on motorbikes.
He said it was past 4 a.m. when they stopped at a gasoline station and the police officer made the two boys get off the cab. A patrol car was there, too, he said.
Bagcal said two police officers forced one of the boys to his knees. The boy raised his arms and pleaded for his life, he said, but was shot by the officers, whom he identified as PO1 Jeffrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquilita.
The two officers were at the hearing and were pointed out by Bagcal.
The other witness, Daniel, said he saw the shooting and it happened before 2 a.m. near a gas station along C3 Road.
He said he was looking for an eatery after attending the birthday party of a friend when he saw the shooting.


He said he did not see a taxi in the area.
But like Bagcal, he said he saw a younger boy inside the patrol car.
Daniel also identified Perez and Arquilita as the ones who shot the boy later identified as Arnaiz.
“Our process here is so dismaying and, more importantly, scary. The police should log in people who went to the precinct so there would be evidence that you were there so you won’t just disappear or be missing,” Poe said after questioning the two witnesses.
Poe also recommended protection for Daniel, whose face was covered throughout the hearing.

“They should fix their priests first. They have many scandals. There are many pedophiles [among them]. They should fix their ranks first. Why don’t they scold their own priests?” Alvarez said.
He said it was possible that the questions asked of the SWS respondents might have been biased against the President. 
“Let us look at whether there is no slant here or if it is being used to say the trust in the President has gone down,” Alvarez said.
“First, what were the questions? Second, what areas were surveyed? In Mindanao, there was no decline. In fact, it went up one point. But it went down in the Visayas and Mindanao. So let us ask SWS, what are the areas and what questions were asked,” he said.
Uniform surveys
Told that the SWS questions were uniform every survey period, Alvarez conceded he had not read the reports.
Net public satisfaction with Mr. Duterte plunged 18 points from +66 to +44, while his net trust rating declined 15 points from +75 to +60 in June, according to SWS.

Alvarez also mistakenly attributed to SWS a statement that despite the fall in his popularity “there is still love” for the President.
He ranted that such a remark was unheard of coming from the pollster.
Told that the statement actually came from presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella, Alvarez joked: “Well, for me, it’s hard to talk about love.”

Pimentel and Almeranez were relieved from the PPSC and as police chief of Socorro town (Oriental Mindoro), respectively, following their arrest in relation to Luz’s murder.
Luz, 51, was the regional chair of the Citizens Crime Watch, an anticrime watchdog, when she was shot and killed in front of her house in Barangay Maligaya in Gloria town on Oct. 9 last year. 
Pimentel and Almeranez, who wore a balaclava and a woman’s wig on the night of Luz’s murder, were arrested by Gloria policemen after a pursuit. Two other suspects escaped.
The policemen were detained in the Gloria police station after two months under hospital arrest. They were later transferred to the National Bureau of Investigation’s detention facility in Manila.
In August, the court handling the murder case allowed their temporary release after posting bail worth a total of P1 million. The court granted the policemen’s petition for bail, saying the prosecution failed to establish “conspiracy” in the murder.
“After they posted bail, their forced leave [in the PNP] was also [lifted] and so [the payment of] their salaries resumed,” Destura said.
The suspension of the payment of their salaries, however, did not cover their two-month stay in the hospital “because the case had not yet been docketed at that time,” Destura said.

Also in August, Chief Supt. Wilben Mayor, Mimaropa police director, signed the officers’ dismissal order after they were found liable for grave misconduct.
Records showed that the policemen spent only eight months in detention.
Supt. Imelda Tolentino, spokesperson for the Mimaropa police, said the policemen were asked to report to the regional police office in Calapan City on Oct. 17 to receive a copy of the dismissal order.
Pimentel and Almeranez have yet to file an appeal to the administrative case. On Nov. 3, they sought an extension to file their motion for reconsideration.
Earlier, Luz’s relatives chided the government for claiming that there were no extrajudicial killings (EJKs) on President Duterte’s watch.
According to them, Luz’s death is one that perfectly fits the EJK profile.
“Isn’t it [an EJK] when a state agent, someone in authority, unjustly kills a helpless civilian?” her sister Perlita Alvarez said in an earlier interview. “To me, that should be clear enough.”—MARICAR CINCO

This was the common cry of thousands of parishioners, including the youth, from churches all over Albay province at rallies in three cities — Ligao, Tabaco and this city — against the street executions of drug suspects.

Students and members of youth groups, some of them Church-backed, carried placards and prayed the Rosary with other participants in the rallies.
In this city, protesters assembled at St. Raphael Church and walked 4 kilometers to Albay Cathedral, which was designated as convergence area for the rallies that carried the theme “Stop the killings, start the healing.”FEATURED STORIES

Vincent Dominic Salinel, 18, a student of St. Peter’s Academy in Polangui town, said he joined the rallies because he believed these could draw government attention and help put a stop to the gangland-style executions of suspected drug users and pushers in mostly urban poor communities.
“I really feel sorry for the victims especially those students who were wrongly identified and killed by authorities,” he said.
“This has to be stopped,” he said. 
Kyle Escalada, a Grade 11 student of Divine World College of Legazpi Senior High School Department, said being at the rally was his way of sympathizing with relatives of victims of killings.
“I am offering prayers for them, that they may be comforted at all times,” he said.
He said he was “sick and tired” of hearing news about killings in the country.
“Our place is no longer safe,” he said.
“We don’t want to become another Kian,” Kyle said. “We want to enjoy our life to the fullest so please let’s stop the killings,” he said.

He was referring to 17-year-old Kian delos Santos who was killed by police in a drug operation in Caloocan City in Metro Manila.
Rev. Fr. Rex Arjona, Social Action Center director of the Diocese of Legazpi, said the main objective of the rallies was to raise the level of consciousness among the faithful about why the killings should stop and the process of healing should start.
“The call to stop the killings is a shared responsibility,” Arjona said. “It has to be a concerted effort, not only by the police or by the government and even by the Church.”
He said Church leaders were also calling on the government to practice accountability and transparency since good governance was attainable only if human rights and lives were respected.
After Mass, Bishop Joel Baylon, head of Diocese of Legazpi, and parishioners lit candles praying for government enlightenment.

The families of at least 30 victims of President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal war on drugs gathered at a Quezon City church on Tuesday, eve of All Saints’ Day, to remember their slain loved ones and press their demand for justice.
Mothers, fathers, spouses and children of the victims attended a Mass offered for the departed at San Isidro Labrador Parish Church in Bagong Silangan village.

Catholic priest Gilbert Billena, in his homily, said the victims would not find peace if their families would not seek justice.
“It might not be today or tomorrow, but we believe that we would attain justice if we act together,” he said. “And the day will come that God would hear our prayers, our shouts, and our hopes.”FEATURED STORIES

Billena is also the spokesperson for the ecumenical group, Rise Up for Life and for Rights.
Aside from prayers, the families also offered flowers and candles for the victims. 
They also shared stories of how they lost their parents or children, and comforted each other in tight embraces.
During the Mass, Erlinda Baginon, 69, could not stop weeping.
Her son, Antonio, was one of the first victims of the war on drugs that President Duterte launched right after taking office in June last year.
Antonio was shot dead by three unidentified men inside his home at Humanity Village in Bagong Silangan on July 11, 2016.
The 51-year-old was also the first to be killed in the village, where many of the city’s poorest reside.

“Without my son, I do not know what to do,” Erlinda said. “I do not have money even to visit his grave in Bagbag Public Cemetery or buy candles for him.”
From July 2016 to July 2017, at least 37 people were killed in Bagong Silangan, Billena said.
“Even us priests find it hard to sleep as we hear gunshots at nighttime … We became traumatized from hearing the sirens of ambulances,” he said.
Quezon City Police District records showed that since the start of the war on drugs, more than 900 people have been killed in the city, with 369 slain in police operations.
More than 540 have been killed by unknown assailants—cases described by the police as “deaths under investigation.”
The Batasan Police Station, which covers Bagong Silangan and five other villages, topped the district’s 12 stations in the number of deaths: 339 killed by unknown gunmen, 120 slain by police in drug raids.
After the Mass, the families of the victims gathered at the Batasan Police Station, just across the House of Representatives, to offer flowers for their slain loved ones.
The families also called on the police to fulfill their duty to serve and protect the people.
“This symbolizes the scene of the crime, because many families believe that their relatives were killed by the police,” said Nardy Sabino of Rise Up.
“We hope the police understand why we’re here, because those they killed also had dreams like them,” Sabino added.

Slain pedicab driver Michael Siaron, who became a global poster boy against the Duterte administration’s war on drugs, was actually killed by a drug syndicate and not by the police,  Malacañang said on Saturday.
The 30-year-old Siaron, whom police believed to be a drug pusher, was gunned down in Pasay City last year by motorcycle-riding men who left a cardboard sign with the words “Pusher ako, wag tularan [I’m a pusher, do not imitate]” near his body.

Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said police evidence indicated that Siaron was killed by a drug ring member.
“Authorities have put closure on the death of Michael Siaron, whose photo was compared to the Pieta image, after ballistic examination from a recovered firearm revealed that he was killed by a member of a syndicate also involved in the illegal drug trade,” Abella said. 
Killer also killed
He issued the statement after the Pasay City police identified Siaron’s alleged killer as Nesty Santiago, from whom lawmen supposedly recovered a firearm that was later subjected to a ballistic test.
Santiago himself was killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen on Dec. 29, 2016, five months after Siaron’s killing.
The police said that ballistic tests on Santiago’s gun matched the results of five other cases, all involving drugs. He was apparently a member of a syndicate involved in robberies, car thefts, hired killings and illegal drugs, the police added.
Abella said that the findings on Siaron’s death supported the administration’s claim that drug syndicates were behind many of the killings in the country.

Eliminating each other
“The Siaron case verifies what government has said from the start of the campaign… Many of these killings were perpetrated by those involved in drug operations as well—drug traffickers and pushers eliminating each other,” he said.
Premature attribution
“The relentless attribution of such killings to police operations was both premature and unfair to law-abiding enforcement officers who risk life and limb to stop the proliferation of illegal drugs in our society,” he added.
Abella said the government would continue to pursue cases of deaths under investigation to identify the culprits and bring them to justice.
The day after Siaron’s death, Mr. Duterte said in his first State of the Nation Address on July 25 that the media was trying to portray Siaron as Jesus Christ in Michelangelo’s Pieta sculpture.
“That’s how they are. We’re being melodramatic here,” he had said in Filipino.
But while recent opinion polls suggest 8 in 10 Filipinos support the drug war, the President’s trust and satisfaction ratings sustained their biggest drops since he assumed office.
Mr. Duterte subsequently pulled the Philippine National Police out of the drug war for the second time and designated the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency as lead agency.

The Department of Health (DOH) has bared its plans to ensure that drug rehabilitation services are more accessible and a better fit for the country’s drug dependents who are in need of treatment.
Out of the 17 regions in the country, only the Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan) region and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao do not have a regional drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation center (DATRC).

“No bigger effort has been mounted in the fight against drugs, with so many government and nongovernment agencies involved recognizing that drug addiction is a multifaceted problem that must be faced on many fronts,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
Duque made the remarks during the summit on illegal drug control and prevention in Davao City last week.FEATURED STORIES

The country has an estimated four million drug dependents, with around 2 percent in need of rehabilitation and support.
Earlier, Duque noted that large drug rehabilitation centers might be reconfigured as a complement to existing community-based drug rehabilitation facilities. 
This was after former Dangerous Drugs Board Chair Dionisio Santiago admitted that the mega drug rehabilitation center in Nueva Ecija was “a mistake” and “impractical.”
Santiago added that the funds used for the said facility could have been put to better use by funding smaller, community-based drug rehabilitation services.
Among the DOH’s plans are the development of DATRCs as one-stop shops offering treatment of substance use disorders as well as comorbidities and psychiatric conditions.
Soon, DATRC services will include treatment of substance use disorders such as alcohol and nicotine addiction.
“Regional hubs are envisioned to offer patients holistic rehabilitation from treatment to recovery, after-care and relapse prevention with maximum family involvement,” Duque said.

According to a police report, Karl was able to run inside their house but was still chased by the shooter.
“When we woke up, we just saw Tutoy lying on the ground with gunshots in the body and head, blood pouring from him,” Bernadette recalled. 
Police officers who arrived that noon told her the shooting might be a case of “mistaken identity.”
They said the suspects might be vigilantes looking for a robbery suspect called “Carlo Daga.”
Neighbors said that Carlo had not been living Sun Valley “for a long time.”
Asked to comment, Senior Supt. Leon Victor Rosete, chief of the Parañaque City Police Station, denied probers were looking into the “mistaken identity” angle.
“Who told them that? As far as I am concerned, our investigation has no leads on that,” Rosete said.

At his burial on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018, the family and friends of Karl, fondly called Tutoy, wore white bands and shirts calling for justice for his death. His family said he was not involved in drugs or any criminal activities, and was a actually a model son – a good basketball player, a volunteer rescuer and a youth leader in the making. (Photo by DEXTER CABALZA / Philippine Daily Inquirer)
He added that the only update they had on the case as of Sunday was through a closed-circuit television footage they had obtained. It showed a motorcycle riding tandem on Pajero Street at around 4 a.m. on Dec. 26.
“As if we could make up such stories,” Bernadette said. “That–s what the police said and that’s what people here are saying.”
Karl’s shooting had no witnesses except for the Nuñez couple, who could not identify the assailants as both were wearing helmets.
When news reached her in Dubai that teens ended up killed on the streets back in the Philippines, Bernadette was quick to warn her children, especially Karl.
“I always told him to be careful because anyone could be killed,” she said. “He reassured me that he was fine, that he was not into drugs or anything. That he was a law-abiding citizen. But God, look at what happened to him?”
What took up most of Karl’s time was playing basketball. His friends called him “most valuable player” and he was waiting for him to be selected as a varsity team member at Arellano University, where he was in his second year as a Hotel and Restaurant Management major.
At other times, he would be riding his motorcycle with other motorcycle enthusiasts. While on the road, Bernadette said, Karl would be helping those who had met accidents as he was also a volunteer rescuer.
He even planned on running for the next Sangguninang Kabataan elections as he would want to help more people in their community, his mother said.
“We just can’t accept the fact that our son’s life was lost just like that,” she said. “Why did they slaughter him like a pig? He wasn’t a criminal.”
Hundreds of friends and those whom Karl had helped flocked to the Nuñez house, sharing stories of him, until the wee hours of Sunday.


“I am at peace, because he was loved by everyone,” Bernadette said.
In one of the tables, Karl’s former classmates aty Sun Valley National High School were sharing food and drinks.
They had posted a a sketch of Karl on a seat, as if Karl was with them.
“Karl kept bugging us that we should have a reunion as early as possible,” said his friend Mark, who had traveled from Rizal. “We did it. It’s just unfortunate that it was on his wake.”
Last Christmas, Karl and Bernadette completed the nine-day Simbang Gabi, a novena of Masses that ended on Christmas Eve.
According an old saying, those who complete the nine-day series of Masses Old will have their wish granted.
“After the Mass, I asked Tutoy what his wish was,” Bernadette recalled. “At first he said it was a secret, but later on gave in and told me: ‘I just don’t want to see you cry anymore.’ And he just fell asleep on my lap while scratching his back.”
“Justice here in our country is elusive, but I believe Tutoy will be true to his wish,” she said. /atm

Judge Analie Oga-Brual of the QC Metropolitan Trial Court Branch 41 ruled for the acquittal of Harold Arevalo, saying the prosecution failed to support the charge of direct assault that the police filed against the vendor.

In a Nov. 17 decision, the court said the prosecution “failed to positively show” that Arevalo traded shots with the policemen who had killed his friends in a “buybust operation” on Aug. 15 at a house on Lower Sampaguita Extension, Barangay Payatas A.

Members of Quezon City Police District’s Batasan station, particularly Police Officers 2 Wilson Escuro and Herbert Angoluan, claimed that they conducted the operation in Barangay Payatas A based on tip that drugs were being sold in the area.
They said Arevalo was with the group of suspects they encountered and who fired shots when cornered. 
Police report disputed
But Arevalo, who managed to post bail after his arrest, disputed the report from the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) on the supposed drug bust.
In his defense, Arevalo said that at the time of the operation he was just a guest at the house of his friend Cherwen Polo, who was then celebrating his birthday. They were having drinks on the second floor with fellow construction workers William Bordeos, Darwin Hamoy and another man only known as “Rambo.”
A few minutes after midnight, armed men in civilian clothes barged into Polo’s house. Arevalo, who was upstairs with the other guests, started hearing gunshots.
Escape

With Polo telling him to escape, Arevalo leaped out of the second-floor window and landed on the neighbor’s roof.
But one of the officers managed to shoot him, hitting him in the left leg. Immobilized, Arevalo just let his body roll over and fall from the roof.
“This would prove that I have no intention to hurt any police officer and commit direct assault,” Arevalo said in his judicial affidavit. “I saw (the one) who shot me and he was in civilian clothes. But he was not able to get near me because I had already fallen to the ground [from the roof] and fainted.”
“I really didn’t know what happened because at that time I was only visiting a friend (Polo) and I just heard him telling me, tumakbo ka na! (run!)” he later said during cross-examination.
He recalled regaining consciousness in an empty lot. He then asked for help from uniformed policemen he saw nearby, and pretended that he was unaware of the raid on Polo’s house.
But he was placed under arrest while receiving treatment at East Avenue Medical Center, the same hospital where Polo was declared dead on arrival. Bordeos, Hamoy and Rambo were pronounced dead at Quezon City General Hospital.
The QCPD report said there was a fifth suspect—a John Doe—who was killed in the same operation. In earlier Inquirer interviews, the slain suspects’ relatives could not identify this fifth fatality and doubted whether he was really present at the drinking session.
Arevalo maintained he was not aware that the men who entered Polo’s home and declared a raid were policemen because they were not in uniform. “There was a raid inside that house because the people who lived there allegedly used drugs.”
In its decision, the court noted that police officers Escuro and Angoluan admitted during cross-examination that they did not see Arevalo holding a gun or firing back at them during the raid.
“Assuming arguendo that accused is one of the cohorts of those five deceased suspects, that does not exempt the prosecution (from proving) clearly his participation in the alleged firefight that they had prior to their death,” Judge Brual said.


Arevalo, who had since moved out of Payatas, was represented in court by lawyer Ann Marie Loren Pastor of the Public Attorney’s Office.

Jhoanna Ballaran/ INQUIRER.net
For volunteer Celine Bautista*, 36, giving out Christmas grocery bags to different families in Metro Manila is not just an ordinary task—it is a way of coping with the death of her stepson, John Jezreel “JJ” David, in the hands of the police last January under the government’s deadly campaign against illegal drugs.
Seeing the recipients’ faces light up gives comfort and strength for Bautista. Like her, the families also lost their loved ones in the brutal crackdown that has killed thousands of suspected drug criminals.

Bautista is a staff member of Rise Up for Life and for Rights, a Church-based non-profit group that provides assistance and support to victims of extrajudicial killings and their families. She joined the organization in August, as she and her husband sought ways to hold their son’s killers accountable.
“Nakakatulong sa akin personal kasi [naiibsan] din ang sakit. Alam ko, nandoon yung [pag-iyak] kasi hindi ganun kadali tanggapin ang nangyari. Pero sa kabilang banda, alam mo na merong aalalay para sa iyo, merong maglalaan ng oras para pakinggan ‘yung kwento mo,” Bautista told INQUIRER.net in an interview on December 20.FEATURED STORIES

(This helps me relieve the pain. I know that sometimes you get emotional because it is not easy to accept what happened. But on the other hand, you know that there is someone who will help you and spend time to listen to your story.)
Working for the organization helps her get through the pain of losing JJ, who went missing on January 19 and was found dead two days later in a morgue in Sta. Cruz, Manila. 
According to the spot report, he was killed in an alleged buy-bust operation in Delpan in Binondo after fighting back with the police.
Bautista denied the police’s claims as JJ, 21, never used drugs. Some residents in Delpan also told her and her husband, Denisse, that several policemen some in plainclothes and masks, came in the area to conduct an operation on the night of January 20.
One of the witnesses later saw three motorcycles with back riders in handcuffs, who were all brought to an old warehouse. The witness, an old man who lived beside the place, then heard the three men pleading for their lives before shots were heard, Bautista said.
“Naririnig nga raw niya yung nagmamakaawang bata. Meron nga raw nagsabi doon na ‘sir, kesa pahirapan nyo po kami, patayin nyo na lang po kami.’ Tapos meron nga raw siyang naririnig na, ‘sabihin nyo po sa papa ko, sabihin nyo po sa papa ko!’ Siguro kako ‘yun ‘yung anak ko,” she said as her voice quivered.
(He said he had heard the children pleading. One of them said: ‘sir, do not make us suffer, just kill us.’ [The witness] also heard one of them shouting, ‘please tell my papa, tell my papa!’ Maybe that’s my son.)

It took Bautista and her family months to recover, until they finally decided to seek help and sanctuary from a priest who then referred them to Rise Up.
Rise above the tragedy
Rise Up was formed in November last year with the belief that victims of the drug war should not remain victims. Instead, they should rise above the tragedy and become advocates for social justice and change, said Nardy Sabino, convenor of the group.
“Hindi pwedeng manatiling biktima, hindi pwedeng manatiling nagluluksa yung mga namatayan, kailangan nilang bumangon sa kanilang kalagayan, hindi lang dahil sila ay namatayan, bagkus, dahil sa kahirapan na kinakaharap nila,” Sabino said. (Victims should not remain victims, the bereaved should not remain grieving. They need to rise above their condition because they just do not lost their loved ones—they also face suffering from the poverty they face.)
“So Rise Up dahil ang pangarap ay maging bahagi sila ng isang social movement para sa isang social change,” he added.
(So we named it Rise Up because our hope is to make them part of a social movement for social change.)
Rise Up provides different kinds of support to families of the anti-illegal drug campaign, including sanctuary for the victims and their families, legal and medical services, and psychosocial debriefing. The most important, Sabino said, is the organizing aspect, to help the families get back on their feet again and help their fellow victims pursue justice.
Since last year, the group has documented and handled a total of 100 cases of killings, mostly in Navotas City, Caloocan, Manila, Quezon City, and Bulacan. Of these, three have been filed with the Ombudsman, including that of JJ David.
The group’s job is no easy feat—their resources are scarce, volunteers are exposed to stress and trauma in documenting cases, and they are left with the challenge of untangling the victims’ overlapping problems, Sabino said.
“Minsan iiyakan mo ‘yung mga problema, ‘yung patung-patong na trahedya,” he explained.


(Sometimes you’ll cry over the problems, the severe tragedy they face.)
They also have a limited number of volunteers to do the legwork for the immense number of those killed. So far, Rise Up has a total of 15 staff members, and only eight of them work full time.
But these challenges outweigh the group’s desire to hear more stories of the families and seek justice for the deaths of the thousands of victims of the government’s anti-illegal drug campaign.
Christmas wish
This Christmas, Sabino called on the public to give value to life by respecting human rights.
“Pinakamahalaga ngayon lalo na magpa-Pasko makita natin yung buhay kaysa kamatayan. Piliin natin yung liwanag kaysa kadiliman. Mahalaga na ang tao, kung humaharap ka o tumatanaw ka sa isang Pasko, makita mo yung biyaya na ang mahalaga sa Diyos ay yung buhay, hindi yung pagpatay,” he said.
(What is important this Christmas is to see life instead of death. Let us choose light over darkness. If you look forward to Christmas, it is important to see that the most important blessing from the Lord is life, not death.)
JJ’s death has caused Bautista and her family much pain and anguish—but her newfound life as an advocate of justice alleviates her suffering. For her, the most important thing this Christmas is to continue living for others, especially for those like her who have lost their loved ones in the drug war.
“Kailangan kung naghahanap ka ng katarungan, lumabas ka. Ipakita mo sa kanila na kahit alam mong mahirap hanapin ang katarungan, hinahanap mo,” Bautista said. (If you are seeking for justice, you need to get out. Let them know that even though it is hard to find justice, you continuously seek for it.)

The body of Jeannie Rose Porras, 39, a member of the militant Compostela Farmers Association (CFA), was found by relatives at a funeral home in Nabunturan town, according to Jay Apiag, Karapatan Southern Mindanao secretary general.

It was not clear how Porras died or if she had wounds.

Apiag, quoting Porras’ son, said the victim failed to return home in Compostela town after meeting a still unidentified person on Thursday.
“On Dec. 15, Jeannie’s son decided to report the incident to police. He also informed fellow CFA members [about her disappearance], asking their help to look for his mother,” he said. 
Apiag said Karapatan and CFA were trying to gather details regarding Porras’ disappearance and death.
He said the victim was also a farmers’ organizer in Compostela.
Her organization, Apiag said, “had long been the target of killings, illegal arrests and harassment due to [its] antimilitarization, antimining and agrarian reform campaigns.”
On Nov. 29, CFA member Rodrigo Timoteo was shot dead by unidentified gunmen outside his house in Sitio Mambusao in Ngan village, Compostela, while he was preparing to join a protest rally on Bonifacio Day.
Late last year, unidentified suspects gunned down Jimmy Saypan, former CFA leader, as he was driving his motorcycle on his way to Compostela.

Saypan’s death in October 2016 started the string of killings in Compostela Valley, Karapatan said.
In March this year, couple Ramon and Leonila Pesadilla, who were farmers, were killed in Barangay Osmeña, Compostela, as their 5-year-old grandchild watched in horror.
The Pesadilla couple, according to Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), had donated a parcel of their land to a local lumad school.
In linking the military to the killings in Compostela Valley, KMP cited other incidents, including the Dec. 5 disappearance of Jean Bustamante, 17, a lumad member of CFA.
Bustamante, who was accused of being a New People’s Army rebel, was later found held in a camp of the Army’s 66th Infantry Battalion in Mambusao town in Compostela Valley. —FRINSTON LIM

Still in mourning a year after their loved ones were slain, families of victims of extrajudicial killings in Caloocan City condemned Philippine National Police chief Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa’s latest pronouncement urging them to “move on.”
Dela Rosa made the statement last Saturday during the Quezon City Police District’s giftgiving program attended by nearly 700 children, most of whom were orphaned by President Duterte’s war on drugs.

“Do you (Dela Rosa) really think it’s that easy for us to get over their deaths? You are not the one who lost someone,” said Emily Soriano, the mother of 15-year-old Angelito, who was among the seven people gunned down by masked men in Barangay 176, Bagong Silang on Dec. 28, 2016.
“It’s been a year since they died and that’s it? Maybe that’s why your nickname is Bato, because your heart is just as hard as stone,” Soriano added.FEATURED STORIES

Led by ecumenical rights group Rise Up, Soriano and the kin of the other six held a vigil at the barangay’s covered court and on their graves in Tala Cemetery to commemorate their first death anniversary.
The anniversary coincided with the Biblical celebration of the Day of the Innocents, which commemorated King Herod’s orders to execute male babies in Bethlehem in order to kill baby Jesus. 
During the vigil, the group demanded an end to President Duterte’s war on drugs, which they likened to “Herod’s massacre.”
‘Palit-ulo’
“These seven are just some of the many killed (in Caloocan City under the war on drugs). Now we will no longer stand for another Herod to sow death among our nation,” said Norma Dollaga, Rise Up secretariat.
The seven were gunned down by at least three motorcycle-riding men believed to have been targeting a drug suspect.
Among those killed were Angelito, 15; Jonnel Segovia, 15; Sonny Espinosa, 16; Kenneth Lim, 20; Ednel and Cristina Santor; and a pregnant Analyn Diamla.

Their families maintained that the seven were not criminals nor involved in illegal drugs and were likely victims of “palit-ulo,” alleging that the gunmen’s target was Jay-R Santor, a drug suspect who earlier surrendered to authorities under the government’s “Oplan Tokhang.”
Santor owned the two adjacent shanties where the seven were gunned down. The teenagers had gone to attend a birthday party for one of Santor’s sons.
A year later, their families said they found it difficult to move on from their untimely deaths, lamenting how the gunmen snuffed out their futures.
Jimmy Segovia, Jonnel’s father, said that sometimes, he would imagine that his son was still out there peddling buko juice, just like when the boy was still alive.
Emily Soriano, Angelito’s mother, bewails that her son now lays dead in Tala Cemetery while the suspected gunmen who killed him still roam free. “Be, masisisi mo ba si Mama na sinisisi ka niya kasi hindi ka nakinig sakin na ’wag ka na umalis noong gabing ’yon?” she wept.
Processing grief
“It’s so hard to process. I still can’t accept that he’s gone. I already told him that night not to visit his friends because that place was dangerous and he still went,” he said.
At the time, he said, Jonnel was already home when their friend Edward Villanueva invited them to Santor’s house. Jonnel ended up getting shot 13 times during the attack while Villanueva survived.
“Imagine, 13 times. Like they were animals being slaughtered. My son did not deserve that,” Segovia said.
Miguelito, Angelito’s brother, echoed the sentiment. “I may not know anything about how my brother died but what I do know is that he was a student with dreams and a future ahead of him. And then getting told to move on? They know nothing of the pain we are dealing with.”
Soriano pledged on Angelito’s grave that she would continue seeking out justice for her son.


“To all of us who fell victim to this war on drugs, let us unite together and seek justice for the deaths of our sons. To others, please, don’t wait for this to happen to you as well,” she said.

MONTEGRANDE
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has opened an investigation into increasing killings in the government’s counterinsurgency campaign.
Human Rights Commissioner Jose Luis Martin Gascon told the Inquirer on Tuesday that the CHR-Calabarzon office had deployed a team to investigate the Nov. 28 clash between government troops and suspected New People’s Army (NPA) rebels at Nasugbu town, in Batangas province, that left 15 people dead, including five women, one of whom was a student activist from the University of the Philippines.

Gascon said a team from the CHR central office also had been sent to Nueva Ecija province to investigate the killing of retired Catholic priest Marcelito Paez, 72, on Monday night, hours after he helped secure the release from military custody of an organizer for the left-leaning peasant group Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Gitnang Luzon.
Gascon did not mention the killing of religious leader Lovelito Quiñones, 57, in a clash between government troops and suspected NPA rebels in Oriental Mindoro on Sunday, but human rights group Karapatan has asked the CHR to look into Quiñones’ death and the killing of activists in the government’s counterinsurgency operations, which have intensified since the collapse of peace talks between the Duterte administration and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).FEATURED STORIES

Shoot on sight
Karapatan blames the killings on the military, which President Duterte has ordered to shoot NPA rebels on sight, promising troops that he has their back. 
Mr. Duterte also has declared the CPP and the NPA terrorist organizations.
“We’ll continue to monitor events as they unfold,” Gascon said. “Every incident that results in violent clashes is something of concern to anyone, certainly us.”
Gascon said the CHR was investigating “without making any prejudgments.”
“In the context of armed conflict, where you have two sides that are both armed, there are established norms . . . that must be complied with and we need the cooperation of everyone who knows about the facts to determine if international humanitarian law was complied with or not,” he said.
“There were allegations [of] excessive use of force and violence and attacks on noncombatants, and these are some things we would like to be able to clarify,” he added.

Return to negotiations
Gascon said the CHR was “worried” that there might be an “intensification” of clashes between government forces and communist rebels with the collapse of the peace negotiations.
He said both sides should adhere to agreements reached involving human rights and “do everything to return to negotiations so that we can hope to diminish the violence.”
Karapatan blamed the recent killings on the “Duterte regime’s fascist policies and pronouncements.”
“We condemn Duterte and his fellow bloodthirsty cohorts in the military, police and Cabinet … for masterminding these policies, foremost [of which is] this regime’s counterinsurgency program ‘Oplan Kapayapaan,’ which has instigated these attacks,” Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay said in a statement on Tuesday.
“Duterte and his team of bloodthirsty beasts are setting a new threshold for state terror,” Palabay added, noting that 10 activists were killed in just two days.
Karapatan cited initial reports of possible human rights violations, noting “the number of casualties” and “the manner [by which] they were killed.”
104 political killings
“[Just] more than a year in power, the Duterte government has claimed 104 lives in political killings, mostly farmers. There are 449 political prisoners languishing in jails; there are hundreds of people in communities under constant threat of militarization, harassment and food blockade,” said Roneo Clamor, deputy secretary general of Karapatan.
Speaking at the wake for Paez on Tuesday night, Bishop Roberto Mallari of the Diocese of San Jose, in Nueva Ecija, said the government and all other sectors should be concerned about the killing of Quiñones and “all other killings that include children and [elderly people.]”


“Human lives are important, be they very old [or] very young, suspected rebels, soldiers, activists, suspected illegal [drug] pushers and users,” Mallari said.
“They should not be [just] statistics in the [problems that] our country is going through,” he said. —With reports from Anselmo Roque and Tonette Orejas

Badayos was Negros Oriental coordinator of the human rights group Karapatan, while Moises was a member of the farmers group Mantapi Ebwan Farmers Association (Mefa).

Karapatan blamed the killings on goons of a land owner involved in a land dispute with farmers.
Jaime Paglinawan, secretary general of Bayan Muna-Central Visayas, said the funeral march was a show for respect for Badayos and to demand justice.
Moises was buried in Bayawan City on Dec. 3, according to Amid Juntilla, Mefa vice chairperson.
Juntilla said they called off a planned protest action in Bayawan on Sunday because farmers were afraid that another attack would happen.
He said protest actions were held in Dumaguete City, the provincial capital.

Meanwhile, in Iloilo City, about 2,500 protesters led by the Movement Against Tyranny and Bagong Alyansang Makabayan joined a program in front of the provincial capitol before marching through the city’s main streets.
They burned an effigy of a two-headed figure with a rifle depicting the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and President Rodrigo Duterte.
“The killing of human rights activists and even a priest and pastor, harassment of the media and journalists and moves to curtail institutions that serve as a check and balance to the President are manifestations of the growing tyrannical rule,” said Reylan Vergara, secretary general of Karapatan-Panay.
Vergara spoke at the rally days after two unidentified men in a motorcycle went to his house in Mandurriao District, apparently checking if he was there.
“I was not there during that time,” Vergara told the Inquirer. “But my mother-in-law monitored the men, who stayed for about 20 minutes near the front of our house. They left when the realized they were also being watched.”
He said his neighbors also reported that unidentified persons had asked for the location of his house.
“There’s an apparent focus on human rights workers and activists who have been vocal against extrajudicial killings of suspected drug personalities, farmers and members of indigenous people’s communities,” he said.
In Roxas City in Capiz, about 1,000 protesters led by Bayan attended a rally at the Roxas City Plaza Bandstand.
About the same number of protesters marched from the provincial capitol to Crossing Banga in the capital town of Kalibo in Aklan.
In Negros Occidental, at least 3,000 members of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan in Negros Occidental held a rally at the public plaza to denounce what they called a “tyrannical rule” of President Duterte.


They marched to the Bacolod public plaza on Sunday afternoon to mark the International Human Rights day as they chanted “Duterte patalsikin, patalsikin, pagbayarin (Duterte kick him out, kick him out, make him pay).”
They then burned effigies of the head of President Rodrigo Duterte atop the body of a dog on a leash held by US President Donald Trump were torched at the Bacolod public plaza on Sunday afternoon.
“Bayan Negros is calling on all Negrenses to stand up and fight back against the tyrannical rule of Duterte, the saboteur of (a) just and peaceful society, the number one violator of human rights, the architect state sponsored terrorism,” its secretary general Michael dela Concepcion said. /atm

The drug suspects known only as Abis and Jom-Jom, both believed to be around 30 to 35 years old, were small-time pushers that the QCPD had been monitoring for several days, Eleazar told the Inquirer.
Police were also looking into their possible involvement in other crimes as a tattoo on Jom-Jom’s back suggested he was a gang member. 
The drug bust happened at 3:10 a.m. on Sunday, when PO1 James Gumidam of the Batasan police station bought P1,000 worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) from the suspects.
According to Eleazar, the suspects noticed Gumidam’s signal to police operatives and started firing at the backup team. They hit Andres twice in the chest but he was saved by his bulletproof vest.
The suspects got on their motorcycle, leading to a chase which ended at 3:30 a.m. on Payatas Road when they were cornered. Instead of stopping, the suspects began shooting at the police, leading to a fire fight which left them dead.
Found in their possession were P90,000 worth of shabu, a sachet of dried marijuana leaves, a .38-caliber revolver, a 9-mm pistol, two cell phones, their motorcycle and the buy-bust money.

In Pikit town, North Cotabato province, two suspects were killed after police said they shot at law enforcers during a drug raid in the village of Batulawan.

The killings took place just days after relatives of two other suspects accused police of summary executions also during an antidrug operation.

Fought back
Supt. Bernard Tayong, speaking for the North Cotabato police, said police were serving search warrants when five men ran out of one of the target houses and fired at the
policemen. 
Police fired back, hitting two suspects who were rushed to a hospital in Poblacion, another village, where they died. Three of the suspects surrendered.
Tayong identified the slain suspects as Andamen Sapalon, 40, and his brother, Pisko Kanda Sapalon, 30, both residents of Batulawan.
Tayong said Sapalon headed a local drug gang. Those arrested were Baina Taudin, Samer Samad and Johaina Labarios.
On Tuesday, two men identified as Sindatuk Baliwan and Jonathan Mangakoy were also killed in Kabacan town after they allegedly clashed with police during an antidrug operation.

But the suspects’ wives claimed that their husbands were victims of a rubout.
Amira, wife of Baliwan, insisted her husband was “killed in cold blood.”
In the town of Naawan, Misamis Oriental, police arrested three family members, including a village official, for drug pushing.
Senior Insp. Jaime Bastatas, team leader of the Provincial Drug Enforcement Unit, said arrested were Annie Seriño, a village councilor of Linangkayan in Naawan; her husband, Zaldy, and their son, identified only as Bimbo.
Bastatas said police found five sachets of “shabu” (crystal meth), a rifle grenade, M16 bullets and the marked money that police used for the buy-bust operation.
Planted evidence
Seriño said police planted the drugs and guns.
In the town of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao province, soldiers and antinarcotics agents arrested an alleged big-time drug peddler who had been operating near the headquarters of the Army’s 6th Infanty Division.

(Photo by RICHARD A. REYES / Philippine Daily Inquirer)
Taxi driver Tomas Bagcal on Sunday confirmed that it was 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz who robbed him in Caloocan City last month, but belied the police story of a gunfight, calling Arnaiz’s killing “scripted.”
After more than a week in hiding, the 54-year-old cabbie finally surfaced, protected by Rise Up for Life and for Rights, a network of Church people and human rights advocates.

Speaking at a news briefing in Quezon City, Bagcal claimed he was able to catch the robber, whom he later identified as Arnaiz, with the help of bystanders who he said mauled the former University of the Philippines student.

“I took him to the police station, alive,” Bagcal stressed, adding that he wanted Arnaiz to undergo inquest proceedings.
“In an hour, the person who robbed me was killed,” he added. 
Bagcal said Arnaiz tried to shoot him in the cab, but the gun jammed.
He said Arnaiz whipped him in the head with the gun. He showed reporters an injury on his right arm, which he said he sustained in blocking Arnaiz’s blows.
Bagcal said Arnaiz got off the cab and fled. He said he gave chase and sought help from bystanders.
Bagcal stressed that the teenager who robbed him on the night of Aug. 18 and the slain boy identified as Arnaiz were one and the same person.
“When I grabbed him while he was being mauled, I was able to remove the hood of his jacket,” Bagcal said, explaining how he had identified Arnaiz.

At the police station on 9th Avenue, Bagcal said the police told him to follow them in his cab along C-3 Road, but he declined to give details.
“I saw someone walking ahead, then I heard several gunshots,” he said, adding that he took cover behind an electric post for fear of being hit.
“After that, I saw that the person who robbed me was already dead,” he said.
 
‘Scripted’
“But the manner by which they killed him seemed like a stage play, or was scripted,” he added.
The Caloocan police report told a completely different story: After the robbery, Arnaiz got off the cab and fled and Bagcal, while giving chase, “chanced upon” two policemen who were patrolling their beat and asked them for help.
The two officers, identified as PO1 Jeffrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquilita, traded shots with the robber, who was killed on the spot.
Bagcal also said he did not have any affidavit.
“That is not my real statement,” he said, referring to two conflicting statements that police claimed he had submitted to them.


The cabbie said when he took Arnaiz to the police station, the officers there only asked him for his name, age, and date of birth, as well as his cab’s original receipt and certificate of registration.
14-year-old implicated
“The police implicated a 14-year-old in my first affidavit, but only one person robbed me,” he said, referring to Reynaldo de Guzman, who was last seen with Arnaiz in their neighborhood in Cainta, Rizal province, on Aug. 17.
De Guzman’s body was fished out of a creek in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija province, on Sept. 5. His head was wrapped in packing tape and his body bore at least 26 stab wounds.
Bagcal did not explain how De Guzman was implicated, but said he would disclose everything he knew at the “proper venue.”
He said Arnaiz was not handcuffed in the police station.
Autopsy done by the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO), however, showed that Arnaiz had handcuff marks on his wrists.
The PAO crime scene investigation also led to the conclusion that the killing was staged, with no bullet tracks or slugs found on the grassy lot.
Death threats
Bagcal said there were threats to his life and his apartment was ransacked recently, prompting him to seek protection from  Rise Up.


The group said it would continue to give “sanctuary” to Bagcal, as he was a potential witness to the killing of Arnaiz.

This was based on two statements that he gave the Caloocan police on Aug. 18, immediately after the robbery, and on Aug. 29, a day after Eva Arnaiz, the teenager’s mother, identified her son as the one killed by police officers.

In the second affidavit, he said the passenger declared a holdup along C-3 road.
 
Bagcal’s first affidavit is composed of two pages. The driver answered 18 questions asked by homicide investigator PO2 Rodolfo Bautista inside the Caloocan City Police Station.
In the first affidavit, there was no description of the robber. Bagcal simply answered “no” when asked if he knew who held him up.
Bautista: “Nakilala mo ba kung sino ang nanghold up sayo?”
Bagcal: “Hindi po.”
In the second affidavit, given 10 days after the crime, Bagcal provided specific descriptions of the robber who took his wallet.
Bautista: “Nakilala mo ba kung sino ang nangholdup sayo?”

Bagcal: “Hindi po, namukaan ko lang po siya, noong mga panahong iyon, naka itim na sweat shirt na may hood, itim na sombrero, blue na maong short pants, naka tsinelas at may dalang bag.”
According to Bagcal, he went to the police station on Aug. 29 because he was “invited again” to “shed light” on the case.
“Muli po kasi akong inimbitahan para magbigay ng aking nalalaman sa nangyari paghold-up sa akin at kalaunang pagkapatay ng holdupper at liwanagin ang ilang mga detalye,” Bagcal said.
The second affidavit is composed of three pages.
This time, Bagcal answered Bautista’s 24 questions.
Bagcal also clarified and emphasized the following information:
1. The number of suspects
In the first affidavit, Bagcal mentioned the words “mga suspect.” In the second affidavit, he emphasized that there was “only one suspect.”
2. The description of the robber
3. The location and time where he was robbed


4. Which part of his body was hit by the robber
In the first affidavit, Bagcal said he was hit in the arm. In the second affidavit, Bagcal said he was hit in the hand. To show proof, Bagcal stated that a certain PO1 Ellamil accompanied him to Caloocan Medical Center for a medical exam.
In the second affidavit, Bagcal also detailed how he joined the supposed chase and how sure he was that the cops got the right target.
Bautista asked: “Paano mo nalaman o narinig na hinabol at naabutan ng mga pulis yong suspect.”
Bagcal replied: “Pagkwento ko po ng nangyari, naghiwahiwalay na po sila para mahuli yung suspek pero sumunod parin po ako sa nag co-counter flow na motor, ginamit ko po yung taxi ko.”
Bautista: “Paano naka sigurado yung mga pulis na ang hinabol nila yung suspek na nangholdup sayo?”
Bagcal: “Habang naka sunod po ako sa kanila nakita po namin yung suspek tapos huminto po kami sa gater (sic) tapos dun ko na po sinabi na ‘sir yun yung nangholdap sa kin’.”
In both affidavits, Bagcal said he was 150 meters away from where the shootout took place.
But in the second affidavit, Bagcal specified his location during the shootout. He said he was hiding behind n electric post during the exchange of fire. When it was over , the cops called him to show him the body lying on the ground.
Bautista: “Nang matapos na yung barilan mga pulis at holduper may napansin ka ba sa mga pulis or hold-uper?”


Bagcal: “Nakita ko nalang na nakahiga na yung holdaper tapos lumapit yong dalawang pulis para tingnan kung buhay pa tapos sinipa nung isa yung baril ng holdaper.”

Malacañang believes “malignant elements” were behind the recent killings of young people to sabotage President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, but opposition lawmakers said the claim was intended to shift responsibility for the deaths away from the administration.
Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Saturday that Mr. Duterte’s campaign to wipe out the illegal narcotics trade affected “powerful narcopoliticians and deep pocketed drug lords who flourished prior to this administration.”
ADVERTISEMENT







These quarters were expected to discredit the government in the eyes of the people, he said.
“It should not come as a surprise that these malignant elements would conspire to sabotage the President’s campaign to rid the Philippines of illegal drugs and criminality, the centerpiece program of the administration, to succeed, which may include creating scenarios stoking public anger against the government,” Abella said.FEATURED STORIES

“The recent killings apparently targeting the youth should be viewed with suspicion and urgency,” he said.
The killings of Kian delos Santos, 17, Carl Arnaiz, 19, and Reynaldo de Guzman, 14, triggered public outrage. 
The President on Friday said that the killings were “deliberate” and meant to be blamed on the police. Police shoot in self-defense and do not bother wrapping the head of a slain suspect, he said, citing the case of De Guzman.
“Someone is sabotaging them,” he said.
There are no suspects yet in the killing of De Guzman, whose body was found floating in a creek in  Gapan, Nueva Ecija, with dozens of stab wounds days after he and Arnaiz went missing.
Official investigations, however, found that police officers were responsible for the intentional killing of Delos Santos.
The National Bureau of Investigation and the Public Attorney’s Office filed separate murder and evidence planting charges against four Caloocan City police officers in the killing of Delos Santos last month.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Officers admitted killing Delos Santos, an alleged drug runner, and Arnaiz, an alleged robber, but said they did so in self-defense.
Sen. Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of Mr. Duterte, rejected his claim of sabotage.
“Now that public opinion is against the killings of these minors, he reangles the murders he has sanctioned as sabotage,” De Lima, who is detained in Camp Crame on drug charges, said in a statement.
“Wrap your minds around [the President’s claim],” she said. “Discombobulate your brains until it makes sense. But it won’t because this is the logic of the sociopath, where empathy is not even an itch that the deranged President can feel.”
Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, another strident critic of the President, said Mr. Duterte was “backpedalling” because of the growing outcry over the deaths.
Another opposition lawmaker, Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin, a member of the independent bloc in the House of Representatives, said Mr. Duterte’s statements about the killings were “preposterous and absurd.”
He said that as President, Mr. Duterte had almost absolute control over the government, including the security sector, and so much intelligence funds that could be used to find the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings (EJKs).
“It’s the height of irony to blame others while his PNP (Philippine National Police) under General Ronald dela Rosa has done nothing to curb the EJKs nor has the DOJ (Department of Justice) prosecuted people responsible for thousands of murders,” Villarin said.
However, Sen. Richard Gordon, who led an investigation of alleged EJKs last year, said a sabotage “to destabilize” Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs was possible.
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chair Chito Gaston said his agency’s monitoring and evaluation of drug-related killings “has reached a point where we can say there may be a pattern.”


Gaston spoke with reporters this week at the House of Representatives where he sought an increase in the CHR’s budget amid talks that it would be given zero-peso allocation for 2018.
“These consecutive killings of boys that must be answered by law enforcement, which CHR has monitored, will probably support our argument as to why it is not the time to give the CHR zero budget, but instead to increase it, so we may adequately respond to new developments,” he said.
Liberal Party senators said they would block a proposed massive increase in the PNP budget for the antidrug campaign unless it presented alternatives to the killings that have claimed thousands of lives.
For 2018, the PNP has earmarked P900 million from P20 million this year for President Duterte’s war on drugs.
“Filipinos deserve better solutions to the drug menace. We should be capable of developing solutions that leverage on the strength of our families, our communities and our passionate young Filipinos instead of this over-reliance on violence,” Sen. Bam Aquino said.

“They [victims] died there in their home after the gunmen shot them in different parts of the body,” Zaldarriaga added.
He said that witnesses described the suspects as wearing face masks, black ball caps, black long sleeve shirts and black pants. 
Zaldarriaga said the shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday at the victims’ house at 74 Kasipagan St. in Barangay Batasan Hills.
The five men arrived in the area on two motorcycles without license plates, according to witnesses.
Zaldarriaga said Remedillo’s wife, Arseña, witnessed the incident. She said their adopted son, Dela Cruz, had been arrested before for illegal drugs although he was later released.
However, when the government launched its antidrug campaign, he did not voluntarily surrender to barangay officials.
Her husband, on the other hand, was never involved in drugs and “did not even smoke cigarettes,” Arseña told the police.

“We still can’t say if this is drug-related. The case is still under investigation by PO3 Marlon dela Vega,” Zaldarriaga said.

Ana lost her husband and 19-year-old son to President Duterte’s brutal war on drugs in September last year. She and her four children have been living in trauma and constant anxiety since.
They moved out of their small shanty in a slum colony in Metro Manila for fear that police would kill another member of the family. 
Ana’s eldest daughter, a psychology student, dropped out of school to look for a job.
Before tragedy struck, Ana juggled odd jobs, doing laundry and cleaning houses in her old neighborhood.
Her husband augmented her small earnings by working as a drug runner, bringing home P200 to P300.
Now in her new job doing mosaic art, Ana brings all her children—two daughters, aged 18 and 17 and two boys, 11 and 8—to work to make sure that they are all safe.
“We are still shaken by what happened. Whenever my smaller children see a policeman, they tremble and tell me we should all hide,” she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Like Ana, 25-year-old Maria lost two members of her family—her father and eldest brother, who was a single parent—in the first wave of the drug killings in July last year.
Although hard up, she took in her brother’s 8-year-old daughter. “Now, I have three daughters in all and I also have to send her to school,” she said.
But because her husband had been identified as a drug peddler, they moved out of their home, entrusting their children to their parents. Now, they see them only on weekends.
Fear has also shrunk their world. “We make sure that we’re home before it gets dark. We also put multiple locks on our door,” Maria said.
Ana and Maria represent the other face of the war on drugs: broken families living under constant fear and trauma, mothers and wives becoming sole breadwinners, and orphaned children.
According to Dr. Ma. Lourdes Carandang, a clinical psychologist and family therapist, the family is the unit of society most hurt by the war on drugs and many such families are either ignored, pitied or blamed rather than helped.
As the government has no intention of easing the campaign against narcotics, she said, it must establish a program that will help the families of those killed recover from trauma and fear, and help them become productive.
Private groups can also take part in this effort, she said.
Traumatized children should be given priority, she said. If neglected, these children could suffer psychological disorders, such as depression, and may even take drugs, she warned.
Dr. Tomas Bautista, a psychiatrist at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, said the benefits of the antidrug war to the community—safer streets and fewer criminals—would be just temporary if the government would not deal with the roots of drug abuse.


“Today, we might feel safer because there are fewer criminals on the loose. But even if we extinguish all adult drug users while poverty persists, the next generation will have the same problem,” Bautista said.
From a clinical perspective, Bautista said, drug addiction is an illness caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors.
Poverty, he said, generates citizens who have an unhealthy brain circuit for happiness because they don’t have the right nutrition to produce the building blocks for happy chemicals and also lacked education to balance this.
And poverty, he said, is the reason drug use is higher in poor communities.
Many poor people, in desperate need for gratification and happiness, turn to illegal drugs to turn on the switch responsible for releasing happy hormones in the brain, he said.
“People will just shift to another [addictive substance], like alcohol, or to behavioral addiction, like gambling, as long as poverty fuels [their] desperation for gratification and happiness,” he added.
The overly gratified also falls into drug abuse to satiate too many happiness receptors in the brain, he said.
“I really hope that the government and society [will] further broaden their view of the drug problem,” Bautista said.

The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency had classified De Leon as a high-value target, he added. The suspect was also on the PRO-2 watch list for several years as a drug supplier in Isabela, Cagayan, Quirino and Nueva Vizcaya provinces.
“Like many drug lords, De Leon operated through his men. His drug syndicate members included retired police senior superintendents and retired prosecutors,” said Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, QCPD director. 
Several drug-related charges were filed against De Leon but these were all dismissed because of his connections, Medina said.
Found in the house were three guns, a bank book with a balance of P1.2 million and six sachets of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).

Albert Salazar, a resident of Barangay San Miguel, was gunned down reportedly after he fired at an undercover officer posing as a “shabu” buyer on Mulawin Street, Greenwoods Village, Barangay Pinagbuhatan.

The operation was led by Supt. Hendrix Mangaldan, who recently took over DEU. The unit was revamped for the second time by the city police chief, Senior Supt Orlando Yebra Jr., for inefficiency and irregularities.

President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent statements praising the police for killing 32 suspected drug offenders in one day encourage law enforcers to commit abuses and disregard rules in the bloody war on drugs, according to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).
CHR chair Chito Gascon said in a press conference on Friday that the “pace and scale” of the recent killings in Bulacan and Metro Manila that resulted in a double-digit death toll in just one day was “unprecedented” in the year-old antidrug campaign.

32 killed

Dozens of others were killed by the police in Manila and Caloocan City in similar operations a few days later.
Unknown assailants also killed several drug suspects in Quezon City and Marikina. 
Reacting to the Bulacan police report, Mr. Duterte said 32 kills in one night was a “good” thing, adding that if that were the daily toll, the country could be rid of the drug menace.
Impunity
Gascon said such statements “emboldened” security forces to commit abuses and “created conditions for impunity to prevail” where “no one is held into account.”
CHR Commissioner Gwen Pimentel-Gana said the CHR was investigating around 600 drug-related cases in which 800 people had been killed.
However, only 23 cases have been filed with state prosecutors and only one case — the killings of a father and son in Pasay in July 2016 — has been filed in court.

“A singular case — this is unacceptable,” Gascon said. “We need to make sure that our prosecutors do their job of investigating thoroughly all of these cases and filing appropriate charges.”
“Otherwise,” he said, “the climate of impunity … perpetuated and promoted by President Duterte will create the conditions of ratcheting up the body count.”

CITY OF MALOLOS — Eleven more suspects were killed as a 24-hour drug operation in Bulacan province ended on Tuesday night, bringing the number of fatalities to 32.
It was the most number of drug personalities slain in a day in what Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat Jr., provincial police director, described as “uncontrollable situations” in operations that have mostly turned into kill or be killed situations.

The police operations, however, have drawn support from lawyers in Bulacan.
“It’s better to see 20 drug addicts dead than see 20 innocent women or children raped and killed,” said lawyer Jose de la Rama, Central Luzon governor of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP).FEATURED STORIES

“The policemen are just doing their job. It means the drug problem is so wide in scope and so many dependents are still using [narcotics] despite the government initiative to curtail it. The police must be serious in their drug operation in the province and the officers must be commended for doing their job,” said De la Rama, also the IBP Bulacan chapter president.
Lawyer Juvic Degala said the result of the operation was unprecedented in the history of Bulacan. 
“Until proven otherwise, the police officers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly,” he said.
Bulacan Rep. Jonathan Sy-Alvarado said: “The deaths which occurred in a span of one day are alarming. I appeal to people still involved in illegal drugs to stop these activities and surrender peacefully.”
As of Wednesday, families of the slain suspects, most of them identified only by their aliases or first names, had not claimed their bodies, police said.
But a complaint arose about missing motorcycles, pieces of jewelry and cash when the police searched the house of Victoria de la Cruz and her live-in partner, Alvin Marquez, who were among those killed in a police operation in the City of Malolos.
The complaint, however, was aired over social media. “If that were true, the complaint should be filed formally [with the police] and not [posted] on Facebook,” said Danilo Clavio, village chief of Atlag in Malolos.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Clavio said De la Cruz and Marquez were on the Atlag drug watch list.
Caramat said the killing of 32 drug suspects and the arrest of 109 others were the results of 67 police operations in 21 towns and three cities of the province.
Police seized 359 plastic sachets of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) weighing 235.07 grams, and 765 grams of dried marijuana leaves.
Police recovered two grenades and 33 assorted guns from the suspects.
Records from the Bulacan police showed that 602 drug suspects had been killed from July 1, 2016, to May 31 this year.
Responding to concerns over the high number of deaths in antidrug operations, Caramat said the police were ready for any investigation.
“I believe in the legality of our operations and I believe our police operatives are strictly following … procedures and, of course, observing human rights of the victims.  On our part we know that we have done nothing wrong but, of course, there are some sectors that will not believe us.  We are open [to] any investigation,” he said in a press conference on Wednesday at the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame.
“All we can say is that we don’t have any control of the situation. As much as possible, we wanted to remove those elements that would lead us into bloody encounters … but, as I’ve said, we don’t have control of the situation.”
In conducting “one time, big time” operations, the PNP, he said, went for “shock and awe” through superiority in strength, numbers and arms as well as the element of surprise to eliminate factors that could lead to armed encounters with drug suspects.
Caramat later told the Inquirer that most drug suspects had developed the mentality of never surrendering.


“The effect of illegal drugs on them is that they would rather die than be caught or arrested. These are notorious [drug personalities]. When we say notorious, they will fight. They are stubborn and incorrigible already,” he said.

Robredo stressed the need for due process to hold a wrongdoer liable and not put the law in one’s own hands.
“Hindi na hinahayaang gumiling pa iyong mga proseso na nasa Konstitusyon natin para siguruhin na iyong hustisya nabibigay para sa lahat. (The processes under the Constitution is not being allowed to run its course to ensure justice is being given to all),” she said. 
Meanwhile, Akbayan Party-list Rep. Tomasito Villarin said Mr. Duterte’s remarks were “callous and insensitive,” especially in light of his recent admission that the drug problem cannot be easily solved contrary to his campaign promises that it ended in six months.
“President Duterte’s previous admission that illegal drugs can never be fully eradicated the way the US did it in the 70s should send a signal to the PNP to at least take a step back and stop the killings,” the opposition lawmaker said in a statement.
“Lauding this crime only reflects the rejection of a person’s right to life, and our very own humanity as Filipinos,” he added.
Mr. Duterte, in a Wednesday speech before the members of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, described as “maganda (good)” the recent deaths in a “one-time, big-time operation” in Bulacan on Tuesday.
“’Yung namatay daw kanina sa Bulacan, 32, in a massive raid, maganda ‘yun. Makapatay lang tayo ng mga another 32 everyday, then maybe we can reduce what ails this country (The ones who died in Bulacan, 32, in a massive raid, that is good.

The senator, who attended the boy’s wake on Saturday and met with his parents, said the family was being threatened.FEATURED STORIES

“Our primary concern is the continued security and protection of the family and the witnesses who can help bring justice for Kian,” Hontiveros said. She said the family and the witnesses were ready “to tell the truth.”
On Sunday, the Philippine National Police chief, Director General Ronald dela Rosa, told a television program that De los Santos was a drug courier of his father and uncles. 
While Dela Rosa said he was “disappointed” that the boy was killed by the police he described the operation as “legitimate” because there was basis that De los Santos was “a source of drugs in the area.”
Dela Rosa said the boy was a “victim of his own father.”
The PNP chief said he had ordered his internal affairs service to investigate the killing, saying he did wish “an isolated case to diminish the PNP’s accomplishments.”
Hontiveros and Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV said they would support a Senate resolution to seek an inquiry into the killings of Kian and 80 drug suspects in the intensified campaign against the drug menace.
Trillanes and detained Sen. Leila de Lima scoffed at President Duterte’s order for an investigation of the boy’s killing.

“The chief investigator and mastermind of the daily carnage ordering a probe into the Kian killing? What a farcical joke!” De Lima said in a statement.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon urged Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II to remove Caloocan city prosecutor Darwin Cañete “for his manifest partiality and hostility” toward the victim.
Cañete said Kian might not be that innocent.
“The risk of prejudice is too great in the case of Cañete and this behooves the secretary of justice to intervene, if he is
intent on fulfilling his job of administering justice in this country,” Drilon said in a statement.
A witness to the killing has recounted to the Inquirer how three policemen opened fire at De los Santos, who was arrested outside a drug store. “He was pleading, ‘Wag po sir! Wag po sir! (Please don’t).’ But those men still fired at him,” the witness said, adding she was willing to testify on what she saw that night.
Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday joined calls for an inquiry into the boy’s killing.
“What we want is an independent investigation, because, you know, if the parents are not confident with the kind of investigation conducted, it’s as if the case is not given closure, and what happened to Kian is still happening,” she said after attending the teenager’s wake at Barangay 160 in Caloocan.
The Department of Education (DepEd) also denounced De los Santos’ killing.
“While we acknowledge that law enforcement is an important aspect in the government’s comprehensive efforts to battle illegal drugs, ensuring accuracy of information and upholding the rule of law should not be compromised,” the DepEd said in a statement.
The Ateneo de Manila University senior high school student council called for public condemnation of De los Santos’ killing.


“We most strongly express our frustration and deep indignation against extrajudicial killings. We believe that anyone who values life, rule of law and due process, would instinctively share our deep outrage. For too long, we have failed to collectively express our unfathomable anger [at] the injustice brought about by the war on drugs,” it said.
The Child Rights Network (CRN) said: “The state should be made accountable for such blatant act of inhumanity committed against Kian and many others. CRN reminds the government that any efforts to pursue peace and order should never be at the expense of human rights and rule of law, and should always uphold the best interests of Filipino children.” —With reports from Nikko Dizon, Jerome Anng, Vince F.

The boy’s death, one of the thousands since the administration launched its war on drugs last year, triggered an outcry even from some of the President’s allies after witnesses and video footage disputed police claims that Delos Santos was a drug runner who was killed after he shot at officers pursuing him.
Mr. Duterte earlier said that if the investigation pointed to the police’s liability and they were convicted, they would go to jail. 
He had promised to protect law enforcers who carried out his orders in the drug war, saying he would not allow them to be jailed or would pardon them. But he also said this did not mean he would tolerate wrongdoing.
The circumstances surrounding the killing of Delos Santos had stunned both opponents and supporters of the President, prompting senators on both sides to open an inquiry into the young man’s death at the hands of the police.
This has again put the Philippine National Police, its leadership and procedures under the spotlight.
An official of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) weighed in on the issue, reposting a meme from a pro-Duterte Facebook account that defended the PNP as an institution against attacks prompted by wrongdoings by some officers.
“If the acts of a few priests cannot be used to condemn the entire church, why do some insist on condemning the entire PNP because of three cops,” said the meme, which was posted by CHEd Commissioner Prospero de Vera on his Facebook page.

“Good point,” De Vera remarked.
Some priests and bishops have been the most vocal critics of the President’s war on drugs, saying the bloody campaign was antipoor.
De Vera appeared to seek a more balanced view of both the Church and the PNP, citing the “consistency (or inconsistency) of the position taken by many people or by institutions” toward offenses committed by both the police and the clergy.
“It is possible that there are many more policemen involved in illegal activities, but the same goes for priests,” he said.
In defending his antinarcotics campaign, Mr. Duterte has often made scathing criticisms of priests and the Church, saying they were not helping rid the country of the drug menace.
He said early this year that the Church and the clergy were all talk and had no moral ascendancy, citing instances when priests had molested young students.
Later, he called the Catholic Church the “most hypocritical institution” in the country.

The hundreds who joined the funeral march for Kian delos Santos on Saturday came from different sectors, but had a common rallying cry: Stop the killings.
The 17-year-old, whose shooting by police on Aug. 16, drew public outrage and sparked a Senate inquiry, was buried Saturday afternoon in a small niche at La Loma Cemetery amid intermittent rains.

“The heavens wept,” Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David said in his homily during the funeral Mass, comparing the grief of Delos Santos’ parents to that of the Virgin Mary who had to bury her son. And like Jesus, the bishop said, Kian was beaten up and killed despite being innocent.
Leading the funeral march were members of the Church, ecumenical human rights group and several militant organizations who described the boy’s death as proof of the government’s failure to address the drug problem.FEATURED STORIES

The killing has electrified the country and galvanized what had previously been limited opposition to President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs. Thousands of people have been killed since the President took office 14 months ago.
Police said they shot Delos Santos in self-defense after he opened fire on them during the “One-Time, Big-Time” antidrugs operation conducted by Police Community Precinct 7 lawmen in Barangay 160, Caloocan City. 
But Erwin Lachica, 37, a welder who witnessed the shooting said that the Grade 12 student was standing outside the family’s store when the police, who were not in uniform, grabbed and started punching and slapping him before they put him in a headlock and dragged him away. No gunbattle took place, Lachica said.

Kneeling face down
CCTV footage from a neighborhood security camera shows two men marching someone, his head bowed, through a nearby basketball court, while a third man follows. The boy’s body was later found nearby, kneeling face down, and dumped near a pigsty.
The police officers, identified as PO3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda and PO1 Jerwin Cruz, told the Senate hearing on Thursday that they were bundling away a police informant, not Delos Santos. Multiple witnesses, however, said they recognized the youth.
Two autopsy reports, gunpowder tests, eyewitness testimonies and the CCTV footage also belied the police claims.

On Saturday, Delos Santos’ emotionally charged funeral march had mourners clad in white shirts and black ribbons chanting  “Justice for Kian, justice for all!”
Fr. George Alfonso, Sta. Quiteria, Caloocan, parish priest, prayed that the police would “salve the ailment of drug addiction in the country, not with guns, but with prayers and promise of reform.”

Comforting Saldy and Lorenza delos Santos, Bishop David pointed to the family members of some 20 other minors killed in the drug war who had come to offer their condolences.
“Only parents whose children’s lives were snuffed in the prime of their lives would be able to wholly comprehend your grief,” David said, singling out in his homily 19-year-old Raymart Siapo from Navotas, who was killed by vigilantes two months ago. He was told to run, but couldn’t because he was born with clubfeet.
“You know what Raymart’s mother’s name was? Luzviminda. Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao—the three island regions of the Philippines. Through her, the Philippines also lost a child [in Raymart],” David said.
‘Cruel war’
Personnel from the Department of Justice’s witness protection pogram flanked the Delos Santos family, who, apart from occasional emotional outbursts, were silent and refused to talk to the press.
Among the mourners were Public Attorney’s Office chief Persida Acosta, La Salle president Bro. Armin Luistro and Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes.
United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Agnes Callamard,  also tweeted: “My heartfelt condolences to Kian family and to all families victimized by this cruel war. #Makehisdeaththelast #Philippines.”
Callamard earlier described Delos Santos’ death as murder and said all unlawful deaths must be investigated.

The mourners were joined by members of militant groups Anakbayan, Bayan, ACT Teachers, Migrante International; ecumenical group Rise Up for Life and for Rights; and students from different schools and universities.
An emotional Saldy spoke fondly of his favorite son, describing him as the diligent shopkeeper of the family’s small school supplies store.
“Sometimes, I ask [Kian], ‘Why you, of all people? You know, we worked hard so that he could study and become a good citizen … But now he is no more,” he said through tears.
He said he hopes the officers involved in Kian’s death did not have children so they would not have to experience what they had gone through.
‘Beg forgiveness’
“I hope you’d go to Church as soon as possible. It’s not too late to beg for forgiveness,” he said, addressing the three policemen.
“I think those who stood on the streets for Kian were not just onlookers; they were genuinely sympathetic to him and what he stood for,” said running priest Fr. Robert Reyes, who had been at the forefront of protest actions for Delos Santos.
Reyes even likened the boy’s funeral procession to that of the late Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. in 1983, which drew a huge crowd. “ … The only difference was there was no social media in Ninoy’s time. Now, while the procession was taking place, people all over the world know exactly what was happening,” he said.
The boy’s killing has fueled longstanding public anxiety about the drug war’s brutal methods, and could generate wider opposition to a campaign whose critics have so far been largely limited to priests, activists, lawyers and a handful of prominent politicians.
Still, Duterte remains popular, said Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Manila-based Institute for Political and Electoral Reform.

Vulnerable
“It’s not really a tipping point,” he said of Delos Santos’ killing. “But Duterte is vulnerable. His popularity will take a hit.”
By the time the funeral march of about 2,000 people reached northbound Edsa, the mourners had occupied four of five lanes of the highway, with militant groups decrying the President’s “fascist” rule on a megaphone.  Delos Santos’ friends briefly took over to rap to a song they had composed for him: “Wala kang kasalanan, wala kang kasalanan, inosente ka,  Kian! (You are innocent, Kian)!”
“We no longer have our joker,” said one of Delos Santos’ friends, Sharmaine Joy Adante, 15. He liked joking around and didn’t do drugs, she said.  He had wanted to join the police so that his mother, who works in Saudi Arabia, could afford to live in her own country, the girl added.
Reyes said he hopes the people’s call to end the killings does not get buried alongside Delos Santos.
“We should ask everybody not to let this day pass without praying that the Lord (would) make us understand what Kian had done for us, and what He wants us to do for Kian and the other victims,” he said. “Kian is no longer just a 17-year-old boy. He means something more than just one life.” —With a report from Leila Salavaerria and the wires

Members of Youth Resist gathered outside the main gate of the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, and staged a die-in to protest the police killings of 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos on Aug. 16 in Caloocan City and 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz on Aug. 18 also in Caloocan and the subsequent death of his 14-year-old friend Reynaldo de Guzman under unknown circumstances.

Police said Arnaiz robbed a taxi driver and they killed him in an exchange of gunfire.
It remains unclear when and where De Guzman was killed. 
His body was fished out of a creek in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija province, on Tuesday.
He had been stabbed 31 times.
The Youth Resist protesters carried signs that read “Du30 Stabwounds,” referring to the number of knife wounds found on De Guzman’s body.
In the House of Representatives, Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin issued a statement saying the PNP should account for De Guzman’s death. “It is now the norm to kill alleged criminals with latent and excessive force, gangland-style executions that minors are not even spared,” Villarin said.
“The barbaric cruelty of his death is unthinkable but under the Duterte administration, it becomes the new normal,” he said.

“We are moved by the family’s trust and confidence in Rise Up in assisting them in these trying and challenging times. We pray we can fully extend solace and strength to our distressed and fearful brethren,” the statement said.
Bagcal went missing shortly after Arnaiz’s body was found by his parents in a Caloocan City funeral home 10 days after the boy was reported missing. 
Police said Arnaiz, a former University of the Philippines student, was shot dead in an alleged shootout with police responding to Bagcal’s report of a holdup.
But both forensic examinations by the Northern Police District and the Public Attorney’s Office disputed police claims that Arnaiz had resisted arrest and had fired at the police.
Arnaiz was last seen on Aug. 17 with 14-year-old Reynaldo de Guzman, who was found dead on Sept. 7 in a creek in Gapan, Nueva Ecija.
De Guzman had at least 26 stab wounds, with his head wrapped in packaging tape.
National Bureau of Investigation agents had been looking for Bagcal amid fears that he might have been killed because he could provide important information on Arnaiz’s killing.

The decision was reached after an hourslong standoff on Saturday that began with an agreement to turn them over to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG).

The CIDG arrived at San Roque Cathedral in Caloocan City at around 2:30 p.m. on Saturday with the father of one of the minors, a cousin of the other minor. The police was eventually joined by Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption.

“With the help of [Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David], it was clarified who would continue to provide the witnesses with protection,” he added.

Before the killing of Kian delos Santos, 17, during a police operation in Caloocan City last week, youngsters in Pangasinan province had met violent deaths in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war that’s supposed to rescue them from the drug menace.
Those incidents that left victims as young as Danica Mae Garcia, 5, remain unsolved. She was felled by bullets meant for her grandfather, Maximo, at Barangay Mayombo in Dagupan City, exactly a year ago today. Along with her cousins, she was then preparing to attend her afternoon classes in a nearby public school.

The children were behind the curtain that separated the dining room that also served as a living room from their bathroom, where they were either brushing their teeth or taking a bath.
Maximo, seated on a wooden bed, managed to escape. He was on the police list of suspected drug pushers and was supposedly the target of the gunman.FEATURED STORIES

Danica Mae was hit in the head and died in her grandmother’s arms, one of the youngest victims in the drug war.
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) offered financial aid, but nothing has come of it, according to Danica Mae’s grandmother, Gemma. 
Based on police records, 1,269 of 1,364 villages in 43 towns and four cities in the province were drug-affected at the start of Mr. Duterte’s campaign last year.
As of June 15, 1,088 villages, five towns and a city had been declared drug-cleared soon.
The government’s antidrug campaign also resulted in the arrest of 1,577 drug users and pushers.
Thirty-three people were killed when they shot it out with the police. The deaths of 66 others were under investigation, including that of Danica Mae.
The unsolved cases include that of Roman Clifford Manaois, 20, and Rowena Tiamson, 22, who were classmates in a university until he transferred to another school. They both dreamed of building a house for their parents.

The two were killed on the night of July 19, 2016, when gunmen went on a rampage, attacking suspected drug users and pushers.
But Manaois and Tiamson were neither addicts nor drug traffickers, their parents, relatives and friends insist. They were at the wrong place at the wrong time, and perhaps, with the wrong company, when hit men killed them.
Manaois, nicknamed “Oman,” was fetching water when he was asked by John Mark Serrano de Vera, a neighbor, to accompany him to an eatery in Dagupan City to buy “kaleskes,” a kind of soup.
Manaois hopped on the back of the tricycle which De Vera owned. On their way to the eatery, they picked up one Zaldy Abalos.
At 2 a.m. the next day, De Vera’s father rushed to the Manaois’ house in Barangay Carael, crying out, “Go to barangay [Lucao] hall. Oman was shot,” said Dennis, father of Manaois.
“We thought Oman was only hit in the leg,” Dennis recalled, his eyes getting red. But when Dennis and his wife arrived at the barangay hall, they were told to proceed to a morgue where they found their son.
Abalos, the hit men’s apparent target, was also killed, but De Vera was able to run.
The parents of Manaois were at first angry with De Vera whom they blamed for his death until they learned that he, too, was hit, although not fatally.
After the hooded gunmen shot Abalos, they trained their guns on Manaois and De Vera. They started to run when a bullet struck the back of Manaois, piercing his heart. De Vera tried to help Manaois get up but the young man told him to run for his life.
“[Manaois] was a good son,” Dennis said. “He was a big help in the house. He cleaned the house, cooked food. He had no vices at all, let alone drugs.”


Graduation did not come for Rowena Tiamson, who was killed also on July 19, 2016. She would have finished her mass communication course at Colegio de Dagupan in October last year. A school choir member, she also sang at two restaurants in the city to earn money.
At 10 a.m., Tiamson headed for school, which was just a walking distance from her house on Arellano Street, according to her mother, Teresita, 57.
“But at 5 p.m., she was not back home yet so I texted her to ask where she was. She said she went with her friends, a girl from Barangay Mayombo and a boy from Manaoag. At 9:40 p.m., I was already worried and called her up. Her telephone rang three times, then there was silence. I could not contact her anymore,” Teresita said.
The next day, the Tiamson family learned of Rowena’s death from a TV newscast.
Teresita said, “The newscaster asked if anybody has a missing daughter who has a tattoo of a musical note on her wrist, as a body of a girl was found in Manaoag.”
The family went there and found Tiamson. Her head was wrapped with packaging tape. Her body bore bullet wounds. A cardboard was strung around her neck with the words: “Don’t emulate, she is a pusher.”
The families of Manaois and Tiamson have realized they would not be able to find justice for the murder of their children, at least, not under the present administration.
“We cannot fight them. Duterte backs the police and the killers, to whom would we turn to?” Teresita asked.

“They are Kian’s friends and they feel so bad that he’s being maligned in the media and social media as a drug courier, a runner. He’s not. He’s a good kid. A diligent student. He wanted to be a policeman,” Ambrosio said.
She said the witnesses had expressed concern about the possible “disruption of their lives and the safety of their families.” 
Senator’s custody
The witnesses — aged 13, 16 and 31 — are under the care of Sen. Risa Hontiveros.
Ambrosio said she had met the witnesses several times. She also assisted them on Wednesday when they met representatives from the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Bureau of Investigation at the Philippine General Hospital.
The lawyer said she was considering filing murder charges against the Caloocan policemen involved in the killing of Delos Santos.
Hontiveros’ camp would continue to provide sanctuary for the witnesses after they declined to be placed under the custody of the Public Attorney’s Office.

The senator also scoffed at criticisms that her decision to help Delos Santos was politically motivated.
Credibility
She said she had been very vocal against systematic killings under the Duterte administration.
Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II on Wednesday raised doubts about the credibility of the three witnesses, “considering the bias of their handler.”
Aguirre stressed that witnesses were welcome to the government’s witness protection program.

The Philippine National Police on Wednesday disputed the findings of an autopsy conducted by the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) on Kian delos Santos, claiming the 17-year-old had only  two gunshot wounds and not three.
The PNP Crime Laboratory (PNP-CL) said it was impossible for the teenager to have been killed execution-style simply because he was not shot at close range, although tests found no trace of gunpowder nitrates on Kian’s hands.

At a press briefing, Chief Supt. Aurelio Trampe said the autopsy on the teenager showed only two bullet wounds in the head, the entry wounds below the left ear and the other directly in the left ear.

Trampe, the crime laboratory director, pointed out that, contrary to the findings of PAO medicolegal officer Erwin Erfe, there was no gunshot wound in the back.
“Based on the report there was no soot or stippling, which means he was shot from a distance,” according to PNP-CL medicolegal office officer in charge, Jane Monzon. 
Soot is the black substance emitted by a fired gun while stippling or tattooing is an abrasion caused by hot powder from a fired pistol that sprays around the wound and burns the skin, Monzon explained.
Stippling only occurs when the barrel of a gun is less than 60 centimeters (approximately two feet) from the target.
“I assume that the barrel of the gun is more than 60 centimeters away from the victim,” Monzon said.
Already embalmed
She pointed out that while the PNP-CL got first dibs on the autopsy, ahead of the PAO, the teenager’s body was already embalmed.

Monzon clarified that it could not be immediately deduced from the result of the autopsy if the teenager was prone or supine when he was shot.
“If it  is embalmed, there are a lot of limitations and sometimes you cannot really recognize an entry or exit wound,” she said.
Monzon was referring to the finding of a third gunshot wound by the PAO, which the PNP-CL could not explain.
Asked if the PAO conclusion that Kian was executed was definitive, Monzon said: “It seems impossible based on our report … There was no soot and stippling that would suggest that he was shot at close-range.”
The PAO claimed the teenager was shot behind the ear while lying prone, with his killer standing over him.
It said Kian was shot three times—first in the back then twice in the head—and pointed out that there was no indication that Kian had fought back.
PAO chief Persida Acosta said that the wounds indicated that the teenager was intentionally killed.
The PNP paraffin test appeared to validate the PAO findings that Kian had not fought back.
The PNP-CL test on the teenager’s hands yielded negative for any trace of gunpowder nitrate.
But Trampe said the fact that parrafin testing was done more than 72 hours after the incident could have affected the outcome of the examination.


A report from the PNP-CL also found that the 9mm service pistols of the three Caloocan policemen — PO3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda and PO1 Jerwin Cruz — as well as a .45 cal. pistol found at the scene had been fired.

Public outrage over the murder of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos has prompted calls for justice for other youngsters killed in the Duterte administration’s war on drugs.
Investigations of these cases, perpetrated either by lawmen or vigilantes and hidden from media spotlight, have grounded to a halt for a host of reasons, like fear of reprisals, lack of witnesses and plain lack of interest by local authorities, according to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).

In Biñan City, Laguna province, Rodelito Sailog recalled the death of his daughter Kristine Joy, 12, when gunmen attacked a drug suspect eight months ago.

Kristine’s pictures share a small table with a broken stove, empty tin cans, uneaten crackers and wilted flowers. Like an altar with a crucifix and rosaries hanging on the picture frames, the table occupies a corner in the family’s 12-square-meter home occupied by the girl’s coffin during her wake six months ago.
A stray bullet hit Kristine in an attack that killed Allan Fernandez, a suspected drug dealer in their community. It happened in a church compound where the girl was attending a dawn Mass with her family, four days before Christmas. 
“I still remember her watching TV from morning till noon. She would sit around with her cousins, teasing her older brother. She was a cheerful girl,” said Sailog, 40, a seasonal construction worker.
Sailog said he had yet to hear from the police about their inquiry into his child’s death.
The war on drugs has claimed the lives of several thousands in police operations or vigilante violence.
Calabarzon deaths
In the Calabarzon region (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon), police records as of June showed 373 drug suspects were killed allegedly while resisting arrest and engaging policemen in a shootout.

Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa has commended the Calabarzon police for carrying out the most number of antidrug operations in the country that had resulted in the arrest of 15,580 suspects and the surrender of 144,726 others.
“We too were surprised by what was happening. We were not ready for that,” Dr. Rio Magpantay of the Department of Health said of the number who had surrendered in an area with little facility for drug treatment.
There was another youngster killed in Cebu province.
Stray bullet
Wilson Batucan recalled that his 7-year-old son Niño was watching television in their house in Barangay Cansaga, Consolacion town, last Dec. 3 when he was killed by a stray bullet fired by a group of bonnet-wearing men who were chasing a teenage boy accused of selling drugs.
The father cried for justice, claiming that his son’s killers were policemen.
Batucan himself was killed on March 8 in an attack by still unidentified gunmen while he was about to park his motorcycle outside his house.
He had confided to his wife before the incident that he had turned down an offer to settle his son’s case in exchange for money.
His wife, Marilou, 45, said she wanted justice for her husband and son but had decided to remain silent to protect her other children and relatives.
No complaints


Many families of those killed by unknown assailants and police officers in the war on drugs have chosen not to file any complaints for similar reasons, according to CHR’s Edgar Luis.
“All the investigations we are doing are motu proprio (by the agency’s own initiative) because no one is interested or willing to file a complaint or seek an investigation,” Luis said.
The CHR is investigating 21 cases of suspected extrajudicial killings in Western Visayas and 59 cases in Central Visayas involving either policemen or operatives of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. These cases have been elevated to the Office of the Ombudsman.
One of the cases involved the killing of Jerald Inesola, 22, who was picked up from his house in Cebu City and was later killed in what the police claimed was a shootout on July 23, 2016.
The CHR has filed a complaint in connection with the case against SPO2 Renante Nioda and PO2 Arnold Cabildo at the Office of the Ombudsman.
Snail-paced probe
Nicolasa Inesola, 72, a rice cake vendor, said the family was dismayed by the snail-paced investigation. She and her daughter had traveled to Manila to pursue the case.
“We spent for it, but we just could not travel to Manila regularly because the fare was expensive,” Inesola said.
“I want those two policemen to rot in jail. How could they kill my grandson? They don’t have any right to do so even granting that he committed a mistake,” she said as tears welled up in his eyes. —With reports from Nestor P. Burgos and Leo Udtohan

ILOILO CITY – Senator Franklin Drilon on Friday reiterated his call for the Ombudsman to conduct the investigation into the killing of Kian Loyd delos Santos instead of the Department of Justice (DOJ).
“It is obvious that (Secretary of Justice Vitaliano Aguirre) is biased. From the totality of his statements, he tends to protect the policemen rather than project impartiality,” Drilon told reporters here referring to Aguirre’s testimony on Thursday at a hearing of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs.

“After the hearing, we cannot expect the DOJ to remain impartial. That is why in the name of justice, Aguirre should let the Ombudsman conduct the preliminary investigation,” Drilon said later in a statement.
“For obvious reasons, Aguirre declined, and wants to control the preliminary investigation,” the senator said.FEATURED STORIES

Policemen under the Caloocan City police are being investigated for the killing of the 17-year-old boy which the police claimed to be a shootout during a drug raid.
The killing has been met with widespread anger and criticism after security camera footage and witnesses supposedly showed that Delos Santos was arrested, beaten and summary killed by policemen. 
Drilon criticized Aguirre for refusing to allow the Ombudsman to conduct the investigation.
“He said no because he was more concerned with the image with DOJ (rather) than the image that the rule of law is the primary consideration in this investigation,” the senator told reporters.
He cited the statements of Caloocan City prosecutor Darwin Cañete which he said showed partiality for the policemen.
“You cannot help but conclude that the scale of the justice system is tilted in favor of the policemen rather than being neutral and impartial and (to) seek the truth,” Drilon said.
Asked to comment on criticisms that the opposition Liberal Party which he belongs is capitalizing on the issue, Drilon said: “Let the public judge.”

Drilon pointed out that the condemnation on what had happened to Delos Santos has been “universal” which no single group could influence.
He said the condemnation was also because of the details coming out that Delos Santos was defenseless and he was killed on flimsy grounds.
He cited the testimony of the policemen in the Senate hearing that they only found a witness who alleged that Delos Santos was a drug courier a day after he was killed.
One of the policemen had said in the hearing they also got information against Delos Santos from social media.
“But even if (Delos Santos) was involved in illegal drugs activity, is it correct to just shoot him? Tama ba ‘yon (Is that right)?” Drilon said in the press conference.

If the confessional in Catholic churches could speak, they would reveal the horrors of the word “nanlaban (fought back).”
Bishop Pablo Virgilio David of Caloocan City said people afraid to go public had turned to the confessional to disclose how some suspects had been killed in cold blood during police operations.

“We have been hearing the reaction of people on those who fought back in police operations. There are witnesses in many instances in which the suspects did not fight back but were nevertheless killed,” David said.
“Unfortunately, they are afraid to testify. They could only say it in confession,” he said. “When we advise them to come out and testify, the most common response is ‘What about my family? We might be harmed.’”FEATURED STORIES

Confidentiality
The confidentiality guaranteed by the seal of confession prohibits David from further discussing what the witnesses had told the priests. 
This was why, David said, he was glad that witnesses had come to testify against the Caloocan policemen who killed 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in Barangay 160 last week.
According to David, the cities in his archdiocese—Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas — have been “turned into killing fields” in the war on drugs.
“For the first time, because of the outpouring of support, families have summoned the courage to file a case and for witnesses to testify. I am happy that government agencies are now helping to resolve the case,” he said.

Yebra’s report said Escuadro was on the drug watch list of the Pasig police.
In an interview on Saturday, Escuadro’s uncle Cesar admitted that his nephew had used drugs for about four years. 
Escuadro was briefly jailed in Cainta, Rizal, in February this year for a drug-related offense, Cesar recalled. To raise money for his bail, his family had to pawn their house.
Cesar believed that his nephew was targeted for a vigilante-style attack because of his history of drug use. But he maintained that Escuadro was already a changed man after spending time in jail and later going to Pangasinan province to “recover.”
He said Escuadro chose not to enter Pasig’s own recovery program for drug users because “the attendees were being marked.”
“After they attended the first and second sessions, I noticed that those who missed [the next sessions] were killed,” Cesar said.
“I was hoping that my nephew would not be killed because he was already changing,” he said. “I never realized that losing a family member this way would be this painful. He should have been given another chance. There was no need to kill him.”

He said Mariano, Escuadro’s partner, worked in a garments factory and was not known to take drugs. But she still ended up dead as collateral damage –  “nadamay lang.”
Also in Pasig, another man on the police watch list was shot and wounded by an unidentified assailant around 6:15 p.m. Friday.
Yebra said Rodel Odang, 40, was standing on Manga Extension in Barangay Kalawaan when he was shot in the neck.
Odang remained in critical condition at a Pasig hospital as of this posting. /atm

Photo by Vince F. Nonato.
The Integrated Bar of the Philippines has filed a criminal and administrative complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman against six Caloocan City policemen over the August 16 killing of 17-year-old student Kian Loyd delos Santos.
Caloocan City police superiors, led by relieved Northern Police District head Police Chief Supt. Roberto Fajardo, were blamed in the 13-page complaint filed Monday for failing to “inculcate a respect for basic human rights in their subordinates.”

Instead of taking corrective action, the IBP said PCSupt. Fajardo and other higher-ups even “tried to justify” the legal and procedural violations of law “by accusing Kian and members of his family of being involved in the drug trade.”
IBP National President Abdiel Dan Fajardo, who heads the country’s mandatory bar organization, sought administrative charges for grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty for “blatant violations” of Philippine National Police operational procedures.FEATURED STORIES

Besides PCSupt. Fajardo, the other respondents were Police Senior Supt. Chito Bersaluna, Police Chief Insp. Amor Cerillo, Police Officer 3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda, and PO1 Jerwin Cruz. Asset Nono Lubiras as well as unidentified John Does were also named as respondents.
The complaint was based on the IBP’s interviews with the three eyewitnesses who are under Senate custody and protection. Their names were redacted from the copy of the complaint furnished to reporters. 
Although the Office of the Ombudsman has commenced a motu proprio investigation without any complaint being filed yet, Atty. Fajardo said the IBP’s filing of the complaint should hasten the process of indicting the police officers and dismissing them from government service.
“The IBP hopes that with these affidavits of the witnesses, the Ombudsman can now proceed with the investigation and assume jurisdiction and file the information for murder, etc., against the respondents and remove from office the higher-ups for gross neglect of duty,” he told reporters in an interview.
Although the Department of Justice is also tackling separate complaints by the Public Attorney’s Office and the National Bureau of Investigation, Atty. Fajardo also said the IBP believed that “with respect to the accountability of public officers, the superior office is always the Office of the Ombudsman.”
“Anytime the Ombudsman can always assume jurisdiction if the respondent is a public official regardless of the offense, in relation to his functions,” Atty. Fajardo said.
Failure to enforce compliance

Higher-ups PCSupt. Fajardo, Bersaluna and Cerillo were faulted for the alleged failure to enforce compliance with PNP procedures and instill respect for human rights, which the IBP president said constituted gross neglect of duty.
The complaint also cited the doctrine of command responsibility under Executive Order No. 226, s. 1995., which presumes a PNP commander has knowledge of irregularities and criminal offenses when they become widespread or regularly committed especially by immediate staff.
Yet, PCSupt. Fajardo and Bersaluna accused Delos Santos of being a drug seller in an Aug. 21 press conference. The complaint also cited Bersaluna’s admission in an Aug. 24 Senate hearing that their only basis for the claim was “social media.”
The IBP said even if Delos Santos’ family indeed dealt with illegal drugs, it did not justify his murder as well as the “utter failure” of the policemen to respect basic constitutional rights and comply with PNP operational procedures.
For their part, Oares, Pereda and Cruz, as well as an unidentified companion, failed to take Delos Santos to a police station for investigation and disposition, as well as apprise him of his constitutional rights, take photographs, conduct an inventory of evidence and present him for drug testing.
“Considering that the Respondents disguised the wanton killing of a minor as a legitimate police operation, it is submitted that this constitutes corruption as well as a clear intent to violate the law,” read the complaint filed by Atty. Fajardo on behalf of the IBP.
Criminal offenses
 
Besides the administrative offenses, Atty. Fajardo also sought criminal charges against Oares, Pereda, Cruz and Lubiras—who were more directly implicated in the killing—for murder, child abuse, violation of domicile and planting of evidence.


The policemen allegedly committed murder because Delos Santos was outnumbered and “had no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate against three (perhaps four) armed police officers.”
Bringing along their purported asset and fellow respondent Nono Lubiran also showed the policemen’s purpose of identifying a target and pursuing a “pre-determined and deliberate plan of action.”
A witness, whose name was redacted in the copy released to reporters, also saw the policemen force Delos Santos to hold the .45-caliber pistol eventually found in his body.
The same witness saw the policemen frisk the teenager and find nothing, which the IBP said “logically” meant the shabu (crystal meth) found in his body could only have been placed there by the officers.
This was in violation of Sections 3(cc) and 29 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act and Section 38 of the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act which penalize the planting of evidence.
Asked in the interview if the case could also involve even higher officials at the national headquarters, Atty. Fajardo said the IBP could only implicate local district policemen on the basis of the available testimonies.
“It all depends on the Ombudsman now, because the IBP does not have the awesome powers the Ombudsman has,” he said.

On Monday, Dr. Erwin Erfe, who led the forensic team from the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO), said two of the teenager’s wounds in the chest indicated he was kneeling when shot. He had a wound on his right arm probably because he tried to block the shot. The rest of the shots were made while the victim was already on the ground.
Erfe said the three shots to the chest were grouping shots that targeted the heart and its vessels.FEATURED STORIES

Duterte issued the order in a news conference late Tuesday after a televised Senate investigation into the allegations, during which Director General Ronald dela Rosa, chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), wept over what he said was his exasperation over unfair allegations against his men.
“Now, this is an order: Bring the media and let them go first so that they can get the story from the beginning to the end,” Duterte said, explaining that when journalists are called in when a gunbattle is over, they’ll say, “Ah, they just dumped the guns on the suspects.”FEATURED STORIES

“If you get shot, will you still believe that those [suspects] have no guns? Go ahead,” the president said, adding that journalists should take positions beside law enforcers during raids on suspected drug dealers’ hideouts.
Duterte’s crackdown, which has left thousands of suspects dead and horrified human rights groups, came under renewed scrutiny after police gunned down a 17-year-old student, Kian Loyd delos Santos, during a raid in a slum in Caloocan City last month. 
Police said Delos Santos was a drug dealer who fired at officers during the raid, but his family and witnesses testified in official investigations, including in the Senate, that he was shot in a dark alley as he pleaded for his life.
Witnesses pointed to evidence, including a village security video, which they said showed two police officers dragging away the teenager shortly before shots rang out and he was found fatally shot in the head, holding a pistol with his left hand although his parent said he was right-handed.
The police officers testified in the Senate that delos Santos was not the man seen being dragged in the video, although several witnesses doubted the police statement.
Murder and torture complaints have been filed against three police officers and their commander in the Aug. 16 shooting of Delos Santos.
Amid a growing outcry, Duterte has said the officers will end up in jail if they killed Delos Santos. He also met the student’s grieving parents to express his condolences.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Duterte has recently been clearer in warning officers they will face the law if they are found to have carried out extrajudicial killings. Before, he promised to defend police from lawsuits and grant them a presidential pardon if they are convicted of any crimes while fighting illegal drugs.
Delos Santos’s death was followed by another outcry over the killing of Carl Angelo Arnaiz, a 19-year-old who police said was killed when he shot it out with police after robbing a taxi driver last month.
Dr. Erwin Erfe, a forensic expert of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) said, however, that Arnaiz apparently was handcuffed, tortured and shot five times, causing his death.
Arnaiz’s parents say he went out with a friend to buy a snack late at night but never returned home. They found him in a morgue 10 days later, but his 14-year-old friend remains missing. Arnaiz was buried Tuesday.
Duterte has stressed his administration does not condone extrajudicial killings, although he has repeatedly threatened drug suspects with death in the past. He sounded astonished over the outcry over the deaths of delos Santos and Arnaiz.
“Two killings make it a policy of the Republic of the Philippines?” Duterte asked. “Why would we kill the innocent?” /atm

Gutierrez had just been released from jail on illegal gambling charges, Garcia added.

Barangay La Paz chair Ferdinand Concepcion, however, said the two CCTV cameras in the area stopped working before the shooting happened.
Two watchmen on duty “may have pressed the wrong button,” causing the CCTV cameras to stop recording, he explained. He said he would have both suspended.
According to Concepcion, the wife of Gutierrez told him that a Manila policeman had apprehended her husband last Sunday for being “maangas (cocky).”
The policeman reportedly warned Gutierrez, “Get yourself together if you don’t want to die.”

The mother of Carl Angelo Arnaiz defended him on Monday after taxi driver Tomas Bagcal positively identified the 19-year-old University of the Philippines (UP) student as the one who robbed him at gunpoint on Aug. 18.
“It’s impossible that he could do such a thing,” Eva Arnaiz told reporters at a briefing in Manila organized by the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption.

“I don’t believe that he could [rob] a person. I couldn’t imagine him engaging those people in a fight,” she said, adding, “He had never been involved in a fight since he was young. No matter where we were, he never got into a fistfight.”
Eva described her son as “a simple teenager” who would rather stay at home than spend time going out with his friends.FEATURED STORIES

“He was not friendly. He only had a few close friends. After his classes, he always went straight home. He only left our house when there was something important he had to do,” she said.
After he was reported missing for days, Bagcal surfaced on Sunday and said that he had sought refuge from the human rights group Rise Up for Life and for Rights after sensing threats to his life. 
He was initially reluctant to identify Arnaiz as the person who held him up but the 54-year-old cabbie eventually confirmed that the teenager was indeed the one who pointed a gun at him and took his wallet.
Bagcal, however, stressed that Arnaiz was still alive when he took him to a police station on 9th Avenue in Caloocan City.
This contradicted two policemen’s claim that the teenager had fired at them during a chase, leading to a shootout which left him dead.
Eva expressed confidence that Bagcal’s testimony would be a big help in pursuing criminal cases against the two police officers.
Bagcal is expected to go to the Senate on Tuesday to attend a hearing on the killing of Arnaiz and two other minors, Kian Loyd delos Santos and Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman.

“He will appear, he will cooperate,” Rise Up convenor Nardy Sabino said in a phone interview.
“As he said before, Bagcal wants to help resolve Carl’s case. He wants to shed light and show the people what he (Bagcal) went through,” Sabino added.
Based on the two affidavits Bagcal submitted to the Caloocan police homicide section, Arnaiz was killed in a shootout with Police Officers 1 Jefrey Perez and Ricky Arquilito. The cab driver, however, said on Sunday that he had nothing to do with the affidavits.
He also pointed out that while Arnaiz had indeed robbed him, the police chase and shootout was “scripted” and “staged.”
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, the chair of the Senate committee which is conducting the hearing, said that a witness claimed he saw Arnaiz and a child inside a police car hours before the former was killed.
“The witness told my staff he could not sleep and that was why he went to my office because he kept on dreaming of the way he and Carl looked at each other,” Lacson said.

Arnaiz was with 14-year-old De Guzman when he left their house in Cainta, Rizal, on Aug. 17, shortly before he supposedly held up Bagcal.
Malacañang has welcomed Bagcal’s decision to come forward and reveal what he knows of Arnaiz’s killing.
Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Monday that Bagcal’s testimony should help bring justice to the boy.
“We look forward to Mr. Tomas Bagcal’s cooperation with authorities as he willingly expressed during his press conference,” Abella told reporters. —WITH AIE BALAGTAS SEE, PHILIP C. TUBEZA AND JHESSET O. ENANO

“Based on the results obtained the source of the DNA profile obtained from the male [corpse, it] cannot be the biological offspring of Eduardo Gabriel and Nina de Guzman,” PNP Deputy Director General for Operations Fernando Mendez told reporters.

For the PNP, he said, De Guzman is now technically a “missing” person.
He said the PNP would continue to investigate the boy’s case. 
De Guzman, 14, was the last known companion of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, who was killed by police in an supposed exchange of gunfire after a taxi robbery in Caloocan City last month.
The body supposedly of De Guzman was found with 26 stab wounds in a creek in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija province, last week.
Gabriel, who traveled to Gapan to bring home the body of his son, said on Monday he could not believe the PNP announcement about the DNA test.
He demanded another test.
Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) chief Persida Rueda-Acosta said the positive identification of the body by the parents outweighed the PNP findings.

Acosta said somebody was trying to mar the investigation of the boy’s killing.
Mendez said the PNP had no idea whose body was found in the Gapan creek.
Quoting the Nueva Ecija police, he said there was no missing person on record in the province.
Contrary to that claim, three people were reported missing in Nueva Ecija before the boy’s body was found: Jayson Flores, 25, of Santa Rita, Cabiao town; Joyland Lucero, 38, of San Antonio town, and Shibani Paul Garcia, a Grade 11 student from Cabanatuan City.
Flores has been missing since Sept. 5. Both Lucero and Garcia have been missing since Sept. 4.
Santos said the PNP crime laboratory in Nueva Ecija requested the DNA test.
She said the boy’s parents gave a sample through a cheek swab.
The police also took a sample from the corpse, she said.
Santos described the sample taken from the body as “good.”
She said the PNP leadership directed the crime laboratory to expedite the test. She added that the PNP had state-of-the-art technology in DNA testing.


Santos said she was aware that the public was skeptical about the result of the DNA test, but that she stood by its integrity.
To dispel any doubts, she suggested tests by other parties.
Supt. Peter Madria, Gapan police chief, confirmed that it was he who requested the DNA test.
“Yes, I made the request because that was the standard operating procedure. But if I am not entitled to the results of the test, that would be OK,” Madria said.
He said he requested the test on Sept. 6, when the boy’s parents claimed the body.
Chief Supt. Amador Corpus, Central Luzon Police director, said the crime laboratory took samples from the body to help in the investigation and because the surnames of the parents were different from the boy’s.
The boy took the surname of his grandmother.
The forensic expert of the PAO said on Monday his office would conduct physical profiling on the body that was fished out of a creek in Nueva Ecija.
Dr. Erwin Erfe, PAO forensic laboratory director, said he stood by the parents’ claim that the boy was their son.
In a phone interview with Inquirer, Erfe said the DNA test result may not be “conclusive,” as several factors could affect tests.


“Factors include sample collection from the subject and the transport, as well as the processing in the laboratory itself,” he said. “You also have to consider the interpretation [of their experts].”

De Guzman, whose identity was put into question after the Philippine National Police (PNP) released its test claiming the body’s DNA sample did not match those of his parents, was buried in a hasty funeral ceremony in Pasig City because of threats to his family’s security.
“Ang gusto namin secure talaga, mahirap na, baka masingitan kami (We want to make sure that they are secure and not leave anything to chance),” Witness Protection Program’s Intelligence Service Operations Group (Isog) Chief Ernie Talabucon told the media after De Guzman’s burial.FEATURED STORIES

“Kasi kahapon nagkatensyon, diba, sa CIDG? (There was tension with the CIDG yesterday, right?)”

Talabucon, however, did not say whether the threat to the security of the boy’s family came from the CIDG.
The contention on the body’s identity led to the CIDG’s attempt to take the body from its wake on Tuesday. The parents refused to give the body, which then led to a commotion.
De Guzman’s parents, Eduardo Gabriel and Lina De Guzman, however, insisted it was their son because of his wart on his left knee and the scar on his neck.
“Anak namin ‘yan, dugo’t laman namin ‘yan. Kami gumawa niyan, sa amin ‘yan (That’s our son, our own flesh and blood. We made him, he’s ours),” Lina told the press.

The whole funeral ceremony lasted for about an hour and a half: the convoy began at De Guzman’s neighborhood in Anak Pawis 2, Cainta, Rizal at around 8:30 a.m. and ended at around 10 a.m. at the Pasig City Public Cemetery where he was buried in an apartment-style crypt.
A brief eulogy was held at the San Antonio Abad Parish in Maybunga, Pasig City.
The family no longer observed burial customs at the cemetery, such as the placing of flowers at the crypt and the “tawid (cross),” where children are crossed over the casket.
The kin immediately left in a van and proceeded to the Department of Justice to be formally admitted to the WPP.
Justice
In his homily, parish priest Fr. Jun Sanchez called for justice for the slain teen as he urged the country’s leaders to stop politicking and instead focus on the pressing issues the country face.
“Sa ating mga lider, sana po iwasan na ang pamumulitika, tapos na ang kampanya, tapos na ang eleksyon, marami po tayong problemang dapat harapin,” Sanchez said.
(To our leaders, please refrain from politicking; the campaign and election were over. We have more problems to face.)
The Church is also open to all those who need help, the priest said.
De Guzman was found Sept. 5 floating in Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in the village of San Roque in Gapan City. His body was riddled with 30 stab wounds and his head was wrapped in a plastic and packing tape.


A Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) autopsy report indicated De Guzman was killed within 24 hours before he was dumped into the creek.
He was last seen on Aug. 18 with another slain teen, 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, when they went out for midnight snacks.
Arnaiz was found dead 10 days later in a morgue in Caloocan City, killed in an alleged shootout with the police after mugging taxi driver Tomas Bagcal.
The boys’ deaths, including that of another teen, Kian delos Santos, have sparked public outrage and have incited more criticisms into Duterte’s violent crackdown against drugs, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of suspected drug personalities. /idl

“He is really our son. He looks like his father,” said Lina de Guzman, wife of Eduardo Gabriel, who identified the body in a funeral parlor in Gapan City on Sept. 5 as that of his 14-year-old son, Reynaldo.

For identification
A report spread on Tuesday that officers from the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) went to the wake for the boy in Cainta, Rizal province, to get the body. 
But Chief Supt. Dionardo Carlos explained on Wednesday that the CIDG team went to the wake only to examine the body for identification, not to get it.
When the parents refused, the team withdrew, Carlos said.
He said the PNP respected the family’s decision to bury the body, but added: “At the end of the day, we have the mandate to investigate the case, particularly who he is. He also has a family.”
Carlos said the PNP would look at the place where the body was buried and make sure it was really there—in case it would be “needed in the ongoing investigation.”
‘Missing person’

On the request of Gapan police, the PNP Crime Laboratory conducted a DNA test on the boy’s body and returned a report on Monday that the body was not that of the Gabriel couple’s son Reynaldo.
The PNP then declared Reynaldo de Guzman a “missing person.”
The parents rejected the PNP finding and refused a second test.
Persida Rueda-Acosta, chief of the Public Attorney’s Office, said the National Bureau of Investigation had done a DNA test on the body and found that it was the couple’s son.
The boy was the last known companion of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, whom police said they killed in an exchange of gunfire after the former University of the Philippines student robbed a taxi driver in Caloocan on Aug. 18.
But the taxi driver, Tomas Bagcal, told a news conference on Sunday that he caught Arnaiz with the help of bystanders and took him to the police station on 9th Avenue alive.
Justice for victims
Bagcal did not mention De Guzman.
The body found in the Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in Gapan bore 26 stab wounds, and Gabriel said he recognized it as his son’s because of familiar marks.
De Guzman, Arnaiz and 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos, whom Caloocan police shot dead in a drug raid on Aug. 16, were the latest victims in President Duterte’s fierce campaign again drugs and crime.


During the Mass held at San Antonio Abad Parish Church before De Guzman’s burial in Pasig Public Cemetery on Wednesday morning, Fr. Loreto Sanchez Jr. demanded justice for the boy and other victims of the crackdown.
Sanchez also excoriated the country’s leaders for playing politics for personal gain.
“To our leaders, I hope you avoid politicking. The campaign and the elections are over. There are now many issues we need to face,” Sanchez said in his homily.
He also urged those present to pray for innocent victims of Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, saying one death in a family is a loss for all families.
“The Church will continue to advocate for the value of each life,” Sanchez said, adding that keeping quiet is cowardice.
He said he hoped the killers of De Guzman would feel remorse and turn themselves in for a “chance to renew themselves.”

The parents of a 16-year-old boy who has been missing for nearly three weeks are certain that a decomposing body found in a stream in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, is that of their son, Michael Angelo Remecio.
Remecio’s mother, Genevie, 39, said he left their house in Barangay 176, Caloocan City, at 9 p.m. on Aug. 25, hoping to make some money by driving a tricycle. When he failed to come home, she filed a missing persons report with barangay officials on Sept. 1.

At 3:20 p.m. Wednesday, a male body was found in a stream at Evergreen Subdivision, Barangay Gaya-Gaya in SJDM by scavengers who noticed a foul smell.
The body was in such a bad state, making it impossible to make out any identifying marks or features, SPO1 Edcel Israel, commander of SJDM’s Police Community Precinct 2, told the Inquirer on Thursday.FEATURED STORIES

The only thing they were certain of was that the victim was male. He was wearing a black shirt and basketball shorts and his hands had been tied together with a nylon cord.
When Genevie and her husband, Dionisio, learned about the discovery, they went to Bulacan that same afternoon and through the clothes on the body, positively identified him as their missing son. 
Israel said it was possible that the body was dumped elsewhere and carried downstream by the current, only to surface after floods caused by Tropical Depression “Maring” subsided. He confirmed that the stream where the victim was found passes through Caloocan City.
Should the body be proven to be Remicio’s, he would be the third teenager killed under mysterious circumstances in Caloocan City last month after 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos and 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz.
For now, the body remains at a funeral home in SJDM pending the results of an autopsy and a DNA test.
Remecio’s parents said they could not think of a possible motive for their son’s killing as Genevie described him as a selfless, helpful teenager who enjoyed making friends.
“He became a tricycle driver because he wanted to help us,” she told the Inquirer.

Remecio, whose decomposing body was recovered by scavengers in a stream in San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan, on Sept. 13, was buried on Sunday after his body was autopsied by members of the PAO forensic team.
Acosta said the forensics experts helped the boy’s mother, Genevie, and his father, Dionisio, identify their son as the state of the body made it hard to make out identifying marks or features. 
“Based on our forensics report, the parents positively identified the cadaver as that of their son because he had a previous appendectomy and an injury on the left elbow,” she added.
Remecio was last seen alive when he left their house in Barangay 176, Caloocan City on the night of Aug. 25. He told his mother he would drive a tricycle to earn some money.
The police had said the teenager’s death might be linked to the illegal drug trade or a possible “love triangle.”
Earlier, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) relieved the entire Caloocan police force following the deaths of Delos Santos, Arnaiz, De Guzman and the conduct of an illegal house raid on Sept. 7.
Just last month, the NCRPO named the city police force the best in Metro Manila.

Cruz said the Philippine National Police did not spend a single centavo for the cameras since these were donated by his friends from Metro Manila.
“These body cameras will be used during our antidrug operations and other [anticrime operations]. This will dispel allegations that the police are committing abuses, planting of evidence and even [resorting to] EJK (extrajudicial killings),” Cruz said during an interview. 
“We want to be transparent in our operations. We want to provide protection both to our policemen and the suspects,” he said.
Offices that did not receive any camera were required to record their operations using their mobile phone cameras, he said.
Cruz also encouraged members of the media to join their operations so they could witness “the risks and sacrifices being made by policemen.”
Cruz said he expected that another set of 30 cameras would be distributed to other police stations in the region, which has 121 police stations.

Fifteen Liberal Party (LP) lawmakers from a pro-Duterte coalition of parties in the House of Representatives met with Vice President Leni Robredo on Wednesday, agreeing to block all attempts to impeach her, one of the LP members said yesterday.
Deputy Speaker Miro Quimbo, a ranking LP leader, said the consensus was reached when the LP members met with Robredo at her office in Quezon City.

He said the LP members also had pledged their “strongest commitment of support” to Robredo, currently LP chair.

Quimbo said the threat of impeachment hanging over Robredo and Mr. Duterte was among the topics of the meeting at Robredo’s office.
In a statement, Quimbo said devoting the House’s time to “any impeachment complaint today will only be divisive.” 
“It will only serve to distract us from the many important matters that Congress should be giving priority to,” Quimbo said.
He said the LP members “categorically took a position that we will not support any of the impeachment complaints filed against the leaders of the land.” Quimbo did not mention Mr. Duterte’s name in the statement, though.
At least 32 House members still belong to LP, the party in power during the Aquino administration. Five of them had formed an independent opposition bloc.
In March, an impeachment complaint was filed against Mr. Duterte by Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano, accusing the President of the mass murder of thousands of drug suspects, amassing P2.2 billion in unexplained wealth and absconding on his duty to defend Philippine territory against China.
Robredo’s video message to the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotics Drugs became public on the same day Alejano’s complaint was filed.

Marcos loyalists, led by lawyer Oliver Lozano, filed an impeachment complaint against Robredo at the Speaker’s office for endorsement. Another group is building a case against her.
Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, a bosom buddy of Mr. Duterte, expressed support for the impeachment complaint against Robredo.
Robredo confirmed the meeting with the 15 LP members.
“They said they agreed among themselves that they will protect me,” she said in a transcript of an interview sent by her staffers.
Robredo said she would discuss the matter with more LP members soon but said there is no plan, yet, for LP members to bolt the pro-Duterte coalition in the House.

“Of this number, only 1,398 cases are found to be drug-related, contrary to news reports that there are now close to 9,000 killed connected with the campaign against illegal drugs.,” he said.FEATURED STORIES

Abella’s statement came after the United States expressed concern over the rising cases of alleged extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.
US Assistant Secretary of State for Southeast Asia Patrick Murphy has told a press briefing in Washington that the US government supports the Philippines’ war on drugs but was troubled at the growing cases of killings in the country. 
“We, however, do have a very sustained and deep concern when elements of the drug war are operating outside the rule of law,” Murphy said. “The growing number of extrajudicial killings is troubling.”
Abella responded by saying local authorities were following “operational protocols” in carrying out the government’s war on drugs.
“We share the concern of US Assistant Secretary of State for Southeast Asia Patrick Murphy, who has been quoted in the media saying that ‘there are elements of the drug war that are operating outside the rule of law’,” he said.
“Local authorities follow operational protocols and the proper enforcement of our laws requires the use of reasonable force merited by the attendant circumstances,” he added.
The Palace official assured that law enforcers who abuse their authority would be dealt with properly.

“Those who breach procedures are made to answer before the law.  The Philippine National Police has an Internal Affairs Service (IAS) tasked to probe police accused of such violations,” he said.
The IAS, he said, could suspend or dismiss PNP personnel based on violations incurred and could recommend the filing of criminal charges.  
Abella sought for fairness amid widespread criticism of government’s deadly war on drugs.
“We expect fairness and not a rush to judgment. Right now the people appreciate the changes and the way these are carried out,” he said.
“We ask to be understood not just from a single perspective, but from the point of view of Filipinos who desire change, stability and fairness.”

TAGUM CITY, Davao del Norte – The military denied on Tuesday allegations it was behind the killing of three farmers in Laak, Compostela Valley, even as it dared its accusers to file charges.
Maj. Ezra Balagtey, spokesperson of the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom), said government troops could not have been behind the murder of farmers Cora Lina (not Molina as earlier reported), and couple Arman and Arlyn Almonicar, as “it is the mandate of the military to protect innocent civilians.”

The victims, all members of the militant Nagkahiusang Mag-uuma sa Laak (United Farmers of Laak or Namulak) were gunned down by suspected agents of the Philippine Army’s 60th Infantry Battalion late on Monday, said Jay Apiag, spokesperson of Karapatan Southern Mindanao.
The 45-year-old Lina was shot dead by an unknown assailant at her house in Kibaguio village around 3 p.m., Apiag said.FEATURED STORIES

Some four hours later, the Almonicars were shot dead by unidentified attackers near their home in Purok (Community) 2, Bollukan village, he added.
He said Lina had been receiving threats from the military and had been summoned many times to the 60IB camp. 
“She had also been vilified as a sympathizer of the (New People’s Army),” the rights group spokesperson said.
Balagtey lamented that Karapatan conveniently accused the military of the murders “without even providing proof or evidence.”
“It is our duty to protect the people and that killing innocent civilians is a criminal act,” the regional army spokesperson said.
Maj. Michael Candole, 60IB executive officer, said they had no knowledge of the killings.
He said the military could not have done that “because our job is to protect lives and property.”

“We even gave medical attention to wounded NPA rebels captured during encounters. Killing civilians is for terrorists and traitors. It could be the handiwork of the rebels themselves,” Candole said.
Apiag said they have documented 16 cases of political killings in Southern Mindanao under the nine-month old Duterte administration.
“And none of these cases was acted upon or investigated,” he said.  SFM/rga

(First of two parts)
When Rodrigo Duterte came to power last year, he launched a brutal war on illegal drugs. But more than 8,000 deaths later, the stories of children caught in the web of daily violence stand out as a sobering reminder that the menace cannot be stopped by bullets alone.

Matthew learned it the hard way. At 13, he is a veteran of Manila’s mean streets, having quit school four years earlier to peddle crystal meth, or “shabu,” with his friends.
He earned a third for every sale he made—as much as P200 in commission, or about half of the average daily wage in Manila—cautiously ignoring a public threat by President Duterte that he would kill drug pushers and addicts, and dump their bodies in Manila Bay for the fish to eat.FEATURED STORIES

Last August, a month after Mr. Duterte took office, Matthew was picked up by police officers, beaten and shot. But he survived to tell his story.
“They would have killed him,” said a social worker at a city social welfare and development center who took him in. “Had he not been that strong, he would have died. That pains us.” 
The Inquirer is withholding the center’s name and Matthew’s real identity to protect them from reprisal. The facility prepares children in conflict with the law for reintegration into society.
Describing his terrible ordeal in the hands of police, Matthew said he was kept in jail for days.
“They arrested me. The police officer told me to run, so I ran very fast. I thought he was letting me go. But he shot me. I was knocked out,” he said.
When he came to, he said, he was in the police vehicle and saw his mother trying to come near him. “The cop pinned my head with his foot and threatened to shoot my mother if I would not tell her to leave,” he said.
Matthew said he was being filmed as he writhed in pain.

He was turned over to the police station’s narcotics unit, where he was held for several days. “I know what I did was wrong. But I still don’t understand why he shot me,” he said.
Matthew was healing fast at the city social welfare center.
The boy said he peddled drugs to survive, using his earnings to buy clothes and food for his family. He lives with his 73-year-old grandfather, a delivery man, and an uncle who is mentally ill.
His father, a drug user, is in hiding, social workers said.
Matthew said he had been selling drugs for three months, but refused to divulge his source. “The members of my group are also my friends, and they give me food. We are happy together,” he said.
“Two of my friends were killed by policemen. I was frightened, too,” he said.
A companion, who was arrested with him, was also shot and wounded. He is being held in a jail in another city.
The police investigator in Matthew’s case said the boy was arrested with an adult man.
Contradicting Matthew’s statement, the investigator said the boy was accidentally shot when his companion tried to escape and grabbed an officer’s gun. The man was subdued and detained.
Matthew was detained for five days as he recuperated, while the older suspect was detained for more than 10 days with a bullet in his buttocks.


The Manila police station said four other minors had been killed since Matthew was taken in, mostly by unidentified gunmen.
A 17-year-old suspected drug pusher was also shot dead in a gunfight with police.

Six other children, including a toddler, were wounded when suspected vigilantes targeted a victim.
As Matthew is a minor, no case was filed against him.
“The place outside is not safe for children like him,” his shelter parent said.
Sixteen-year-old Michael Jayson Diaz was not as lucky as Matthew.
On a Saturday morning last June, village security volunteer Lourdes Luna was alerted to a sack dumped near her home at Barangay Commonwealth in suburban Quezon City.
“I gave it a kick and blood oozed out of it,” said Luna, 58, who arrived at the scene with another volunteer. “I immediately thought it was a dead pig.”
The two decided to slash the sack open and were shocked to find the body of a boy inside.
Ironically, a blue baller on the boy’s ankle bore the name of Mr. Duterte, who campaigned on an anticrime platform.


The boy was hogtied and his slender body was bent all the way back so that his head almost touched his feet. His body bore multiple stab wounds.
Crime scene investigators arrived and asked the usual questions.
No one claimed the body.
While President Duterte was still weeks away from officially assuming power, the boy’s death was a clear indication he was intent on keeping his campaign pledge.
Nida Curitana, of the barangay council’s women and children desk, later recognized the body as that of Jayson, who was frequently caught for theft and for breaking the 10 p.m. curfew in the area.
Under the Child and Youth Welfare Code, the Barangay Council for the Protection of Children (BCPC) is tasked with caring for the children.
Jayson was an out-of-school youth from Batasan Hills, said Mercy Aloro, a spokesperson for BCPC-Commonwealth.
As he was not a resident of Commonwealth, the village had no jurisdiction over him and the council let him go whenever he was caught.
The social workers said Jayson was often seen with three other minors who worked as scavengers at night but were known also as runners for drug sellers in a nearby area.
Sadly, stories of poor children in the drug trade have become common. Pushers and traffickers use children because they know that under current laws, minors cannot be prosecuted.


Aloro said a recent case she handled involved an 11-year-old shabu user, who was used as a runner by local drug pushers.
The boy was arrested and detained for several days, like Matthew, but the court later ordered the police to free him.
“The court asked us, ‘What are you going to do with the child?’” Aloro said. “We had only one answer—you cannot send him back to his community. Why? First, it’s dangerous for the kid, he’s already at risk. He could get killed. Pull out the child, that was our recommendation. So his parents sent him to Bicol.”
According to studies, the high drug affectation rate in densely populated areas of Quezon City has contributed to the spread of illegal drugs. This is the same problem in poor communities in Manila, including the slums of Pasay and Tondo districts.
The Quezon City police listed 160 children among those who surrendered for drug offenses from June 2016 last year to Feb. 5.
Nationwide, the Philippine National Police recorded 26,415 children among those who surrendered for drug offenses from July 2016 to January 2017. More than 800,000 turned themselves in during that period.
The majority of those who surrendered were drug users; 131 were arrested for delivering and 299 for selling drugs.
Community leaders say the drug problem has become rampant, but perennial lack of funds and trained personnel are weighing down antidrug programs.
Current laws require local government units to set aside just one percent of their internal revenue allotment (IRA) for local councils for the protection of children. And community social workers need more training on “restorative justice,” according to the Humanitarian Legal Assistance Foundation.
While village social workers were already good in counseling, they have yet to learn other procedures, such as determining children’s level of addiction, the foundation said.


Barangay Commonwealth, for instance, is set to launch this year a pioneering drug rehabilitation program for children, with 100 kids as the first participants.
It was, however, too late for Jayson. The single-page spot report on his death has been shelved in a stockroom in the community hall.
No one has been prosecuted for his murder, a cold case that serves as a cautionary tale for parents and their children in highly vulnerable, impoverished communities.

REYES
In just under three hours, unidentified gunmen killed seven people in four shooting incidents in Quezon City, including two men and two women who were attacked inside their house from late Wednesday night to early Thursday morning.
The cases were recorded by the Quezon City Police District as “deaths under investigation” but raised questions whether they were the continuation of the bloody war on drugs that had so far claimed over 7,000 lives under the seven-month-old Duterte administration.

QCPD director, Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, QCPD director, acknowledged that seven killings in just one night were “unusual” but said there had been similar incidents of such scale in the past.
Eleazar said the homicide division of the QCPD was still investigating whether the deaths were drug-related. “Based on initial information, these are drug users but we still have to verify our information,” he told the Inquirer.FEATURED STORIES

A report to Eleazar said two men on separate motorbikes approached a village outpost in Barangay Commonwealth around 11 p.m. on Wednesday, where Jeffrey Villanueva, 28, and three other barangay public safety officers were on duty.
The gunmen, who both wore helmets and jackets, shot Villanueva several times as his fellow security officers fled in fear. 
SPO2 Terixon Galano of the QCPD-Batasan station said a .38-cal revolver with four live rounds were recovered from the victim’s bag.
An hour later, inside a house at Area 5, Barangay Old Balara, three persons were killed on the spot while a fourth victim died at East Avenue Medical Center.
The QCPD identified two of the victims as Donnie Rey Valenzuela, 28; and Julius Asuncion, 28. The other two fatalities recorded only as “Ate” and “Mirachua” at press time.
Supt. Lito Patay, station commander of QCPD-Batasan, said his men could not immediately confirm whether the victims were on the drug watch list, saying the station’s computer was “corrupted.”
“Until now we have not yet fixed our computer,” he said in a text message. “But our investigation is ongoing.”

In Novaliches, two gunmen in a white vehicle shot a man as he was walking along David Street in Barangay San Bartolome around 12:45 a.m. Thursday.
The victim remained unidentified and was described to be around 30 to 35 years old, of medium build, and had several tattoos on his shoulders, chest and back.
Around 2 a.m., also in Novaliches, a driver identified as Marvin Pio, 35, was found dead with bullet wounds in his neck and face along General Luis Street in Barangay Nagkaisang Nayon.
The Inquirer has yet to receive confirmation from the Novaliches police station commander whether Pio’s death was linked to illegal drugs.
Eleazar said the QCPD would double its efforts to  solve the killings as soon as possible.

TAGBILARAN CITY—What would have been a routine drive home for lawyer Mia Manuelita Mascariñas-Green on Wednesday afternoon ended in a brutal murder witnessed by her three young children in this city in Bohol province.
The four gunmen did not just leave after shooting Mascariñas-Green, 49, who was driving her Toyota Innova. They also taunted  her 10-year-old daughter and 2-year-old twins and the children’s nanny, pointing their guns at them before fleeing on board two motorcycles, police said.

He admitted, though, that while the police had established the identities of the suspects, investigators had yet to determine the motive of the killing, which he described as “well-planned.”
Olaivar said police were not discounting the possibility that the attack was related to Mascariñas-Green’s job as a lawyer. 
“We all knew Attorney Mascariñas (Green), palaban unya (she fights) for the poor,” he said.
Mascariñas-Green was known as an environmental lawyer and was part of the Environmental Legal Assistance Center. She also handled civil and criminal cases.
Olaivar said the suspects were familiar with the lawyer’s daily routine.
Mascariñas-Green left her law office in Dampas District with her children and nanny at 4:27 p.m. on Wednesday.
“It was the usual route she was taking when going home (to Loon town) to escape traffic jams in  the city,” Olaivar said.

When her Toyota Innova reached the corner of H. Zamora and J.A. Clarin Streets in Dao District, two motorcycles blocked her path and fired at her.
Her children were unharmed as they were seated at the back passenger seat.
Mascariñas-Green had  three bullet wounds in the head and four bullet wounds in the body. She died at  Holy Name Hospital Medical Center here.
Investigators recovered at least 27 spent shells from .45 cal. and 9mm pistols from the crime scene, Olaivar said.
Mascariñas-Green’s husband, Stuart, a British, was in Bangkok for a conference and was expected to arrive in Bohol on Thursday. The family had yet to issue an official statement.
Mascariñas-Green  was a student leader  at  Divine Word College of Tagbilaran (DWCT), now Holy Name University.
“She had excellent leadership skills and was articulate. She fought for the rights of students,” said Rosalinda Paredes,  former director for student affairs at DWCT.

DAVAO CITY – In 2009, then Commission on Human Rights chair Leila de Lima led the probe on the Davao Death Squad, which was blamed for the killings of suspected drugs pushers and criminals here.
During the investigation, the CHR team dug up human bones from a “mass grave” inside the firing range, also known as the Laud quarry, in Barangay Ma-a here.

The commission first showed a lone skull from what the agency termed as “set of human bones.” The skull was found from a cave where a thigh bone was also found.
De Lima, in an email to the Philippine Daily Inquirer in 2009, enumerated the following as the ones they exhumed: forearm bone, bone fragment, another bone fragment of a skull from site 1; bone fragment of a skull, incomplete lone bone, part of an arm bone from site 2; forearm bone, a thigh bone, skull with parts missing (the one with a gunshot mark) from site 3; arm bone, three leg bones, a thigh bone, and a long bone fragment from site 4; 107 pieces of bones and bone fragments, six vertebral backbones, two collar bones, 19 rib fragments, two arm bones, one forearm bone (ulna), one forearm bone (radius), two thigh bones, and two pelvic bone fragments.FEATURED STORIES

In a statement released July 14, 2009, the CHR said that more human bones were recovered from the three sites after a witness, whom De Lima said was a former member of the DDS, pointed at the spot. The witness, De Lima said, told them that he buried the victim about five to six years ago.
But the commission has not presented a complete set of human skeletal remains, just fragments. There were also no clothes, personal belongings like shoes or wallets that are usually found in mass graves. 
A CHR press release dated July 7, 2009, stated that diggings were done based on the search warrant issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 34 of Manila. It added: “The site is believed to be the dumping ground of bodies of victims of summary killings, according to informants of the CHR.”
“Diggings immediately undertaken resulted in the findings of several fragments identified by the SOCO (Scene of the Crime Office) as human remains…with positive results so far achieved, the team is very optimistic that more remnants of summary executions are about to be unearthed,” the CHR statement said.
“The multi-agency task force, particularly the CHR and the PNP, assured the public that this no nonsense effort will continue without leaving any stone unturned to carry out its mandate within the legally established procedure allowed under existing laws,” the CHR added.
After the CHR probe, and even with the recovered bones, no charges have been filed against anyone.
De Lima was appointed justice secretary after 2010 by the new President then, Benigno Aquino III.  She is now a senator but has been detained for her alleged connection to the purported illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison.  SFM/rga

A weeping Espinosa recalled that Sonny would often skip classes to help her pick and sell vegetables, just so his brother would have “baon” (a daily allowance) in school. 
“Ang pinakamasakit: Hindi nila binigyan ng pagkakataon ang mga batang magkaroong ng sariling buhay na maayos,” Espinosa said. “At ang pinakamasakit nito: Bakit ang mga walang kasalanan, sila pa ang nadadamay? Dahil ba sa wala silang alam kaya hindi sila makatakbo para makatakas?”
(“What’s really painful is that they didn’t give the children a chance to have a proper life of their own. And what’s even more painful: Why are the innocent the ones who get caught up in the incidents? Is it because they know nothing so that they can’t run away and escape?”)
“Napakahirap isipin na, sa isang iglap lang, mawawala ang isa sa mga anak mo,” she went on. “Bagong taon ang kayakap ko ay isang kabaong na ang laman ay anak ko, dahil lang sa nadadamay. Masama po sa loob ko, pero wala akong magawa. Kaya nga po ngayon, ang hinihiling ko na lang kay Ama, kung sino man po ang may mga kagagawan nito ay siya na po ang bahalang magparusa.”
(“It’s so hard to accept that, in just an instant, your child would be gone. On New Year’s Day what I was embracing was a coffin with my son in it, just because he was caught up in the line of fire. I feel bad about it, but I could do nothing. That’s why all I’m asking for now from the Father is that he be the judge of whoever was responsible for this.”)
She found some comfort from the Church and people who had been helping her. But she said the pain of her loss still weighed heavily.

“Masaya dahil may tumutulong at mabigyan ng kalinawan. Malungkot dahil hindi ko na makakasama ang anak ko. Ang tanging maiiwan na lamang ay alaala at itong picture niya. Malungkot dahil kailan ay hindi ko na siya mayakap,” she said.
(“I’m happy because there are those who are helping and trying to clear up things. I’m said because I can no longer be with my son. All I have left is his memory and his picture. I’m sad because I can never ever embrace him again.”)
“Sino ngayon ang kasama ko? Maisasama ko pa ba to? Hindi na, nang dahil lang sa mga walang puso at iniisip lang ang mga sarili nila. Hindi nila inisip na may buhay at pangarap ang mga pinaslang nila, kundi mga pansarili lang nila,” she said. “Hindi ko alam kung pangkaligtasan ba nila ang mga ginawa nila o para matakpan ang mga kasalanan nila.”
(“Who’s going to be with me now? Can I still be with him? No more, just because of these heartless people who were only thinking of themselves. They didn’t think that the people they killed had lives and dreams of their own. They only thought about themselves. I don’t know if what they did was to ensure their own safety or to cover up for their wrongdoings.”)

Fr. Joselito Bong Sarabia, HEMA founder, called on the government, church leaders, and ordinary citizens to pause, reexamine their conscience, and empathize with the sufferings of the victims of extrajudicial killigns.
Illegal drugs, he said, were being used to justify the spate of summary killings in the country.
“I hope this Lenten season we will be able to pause really and examine why are these things happening,” Sarabia told the Inquirer. “Why do they do this to the poor? And why do we permit this as sambayanang Pilipino (a Filipino nation) – not only as a church but a fellow human being?”
Aside from spiritual help, Sarabia said HEMA, with the help of its partner organizations, have been sheltering EJK victims and witnesses who fear for their lives in their own neighborhoods.
“We have certain witnesses already that we are sheltering in other areas with certain partners and religious orders,” he said. “Pope Francis himself said: Open the doors of the church for refugees. The same also for our beleaguered faithful now. Blood and flesh sanitized. The only option really is to transfer to another place.”
“We need support,” he added. “That’s why some parishes have engaged in livelihood and income-generating programs to sustain their needs.”


There had been no second collection for the victims, he said. But he was thanful that some churches, like Baclaran Church, spend for the burial of the victims.
More than 7,000 Filipinos have been killed in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, which has been denounced by international rights groups as plagued with abuses.
Duterte himself suspended the antinarcotics campaign in January at the height of controversy surrounding the murder of a South Korean businessman Jee Ick Joo inside Camp Crame, the headquarters of the Philippine National Police (PNP). But barely a month after its suspension, the government is mulling a return of the drug war – supposedly because “the situation is getting worse.”
In its latest report, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said Duterte could be held criminally liable for the spate of “systematic” killings in the country. HRW claimed the police were involved in the killings and awere re planting evidence at crime scenes.
Espinosa, speaking for his son and other families who had lost their loved ones, called on Duterte to rethink his war on drugs, which she said was only targeting poor families and communities.
She had this message for Duterte: “Nawa po naman na ang isipin muna niya na ang mga nadadamay ngayon sa mga pinalulunsad ay mga walang kamalay-malay, mga walang kinalaman, at mga mahihirap lamang na katulad ko na nagsusunog ng talbos at kangkong para mabuhay lang ang pamilya. Sana naman po ay maisip na kaming mga mahihirap ay wala kaming kalaban-laban.”
{“I hope he considers first that those who get caught up in these incidents are unaware, had nothing to do with drugs, and are just poor people like me that would eat vegetable sprouts and river spinach to keep the family alive. I hope he will consider that we, the poor people, are completely defenseless“).
Edwin, a father of a victim from Caloocan, also had this plea to the President: “Sana itigil na, wakasan na, tapusin na ang ganitong klaseng pamamaslang sapagkat marami ang nadadamay na inosente.”
(“I hope he will put an end to this kind of killings because so many innocent people have been affected.“) /atm

“Look at what they did to my child. How could they kill him while he was sleeping?” said Teresita Lumawag, showing a photo of her 26-year-old son Ronaldo as he lay bleeding.

The younger Lumawag was one of the thousands who had surrendered to the police to be documented as a drug user under “Oplan Tokhang” campaign. Teresita said he was about to be admitted to a rehabilitation facility when he was killed by unidentified gunmen in their house in Camarin, Caloocan City on Nov. 28 last year.
Sought out and counseled by the clergy, Teresita and about 70 others with similar tales of loss gathered for a 3 p.m. Mass on Thursday at Baclaran Church or the National Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Parañaque City.FEATURED STORIES

“Heaven is weeping with us,” one of them said, carrying a picture of a slain family member.
Celebrated by Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez and several priests from different parishes in Metro Manila, the Mass was the second to be organized by the Holy Eucharist Mass Action (Hema) for the EJK victims.

First Mass
Hema, a group mainly composed of Catholic priests, held the first Mass on Feb. 2 at Our Lady of Victory Chapel in Malabon City. The service gathered more than 250 grieving families.
Dennis Febre, an apostolate program coordinator at Baclaran Church, noted that over the last month, “the number of families we are assisting has more than doubled. From the initial 30, we now have 70 families.”
“People are starting to voice out that they have been victims of violence, after we educated them about their rights,” Febre told the Inquirer.
But Hema founder, Fr. Joselito  Sarabia, noted that compared to the first Mass in Malabon, the Baclaran service saw fewer families in attendance.

“We know they are still scared since they were still being threatened by the police and other people. It took a lot of courage for them to come here,” said Sarabia, who is also the director of St. Vincent Seminary in Quezon City.
Like Lumawag, more mothers, siblings and orphaned children shared their stories during the Mass, unable to hold back tears.
Gretchen Espinosa of Bagong Silang, Caloocan, raged against the killers of her 16-year-old son, Sonny, who was shot dead also on Nov. 28 along with six other people who were listed posthumously by the police as drug suspects.
“Imagine my sadness when New Year came and I was embracing the cold casket of my son!” she said, recounting the wake that lasted for more than a month.
In a message to the killers, Espinosa said: “If you have escaped the law of men, I am sure that you will not escape God’s punishment. It’s one of His commandments: You should not kill.”

Efren Morillo filed a complaint for murder, frustrated murder, robbery and planting of drugs and firearms in the Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday. The suit comes a month after an appeals court ruled on a petition filed by Morillo and the families of the four other victims to issue a protection order keeping the police away from them.

The court also ordered the police involved be transferred to another station and to disclose any evidence against the suspects that led to the drug raid.
Morillo is the first known survivor of the police’s “Oplan Tokhang” to win a court protection under the writ of amparo.FEATURED STORIES

Morillo’s complaint also comes in the wake of the government’s pronouncements that Oplan Tokhang, which has been criticized for violating the right to due process, will soon be revived after it was halted in January. Tokhang is a combination of two Filipino words to mean “knock and plead,” in which police officers would call on homes of suspected drug users to persuade them to surrender.
Named as respondents in Morillo’s complaint were Police Senior Insp. Emil Garcia, Police Officer 3 Allan Formilleza, PO1 James Aggarao and PO1 Melchor Navisaga, who were formerly detailed with the Quezon City Police District Station 6. Also sued were their purported informants Lea Barcelona, Mary Joy Ralo, Lorie Barcelona and Richard Andan alias “Manok.” 
“If I may call on our beloved President, do not continue Oplan Tokhang. The police only use it and abuse it,” Morillo said.
Morillo was visiting a friend’s place in Payatas in August last year when the police raid occurred. He said the policemen shot four of his companions “execution style.” He survived by playing dead, and later escaped despite his injury.
Autopsies indicated that the victims were shot at close range. The informant also allegedly stole jewelry and other items from the ramshackle house of Morillo’s friend, Marcelo “Nonoy” Daa Jr., who was one of those killed.
Lawyer Cristina Antonio of the Center for International Law, a human rights group assisting Morillo in the case, said the relatives of the other victims “would also file criminal and administrative cases against the QC police officers involved and their agents in the weeks to come.”
More charges

“The filing was but a natural step, amparo being also a curative remedy that lays the foundation for criminal and administrative charges,” Antonio said, adding that the relatives were preparing to file charges.
Morillo claimed that he and his friends were playing pool when armed men carried out a raid and shot them when they refused to admit to owning the silver foil and toy gun found at the scene.
“From what I have narrated, it is clear that we were not using “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) but merely playing pool, but we were arrested and forced to admit that we own the plastic sachet with white substance inside that they were holding,” he said in his sworn statement.
Morillo named Formilleza as the policeman who shot him and his friend when they protested their innocence. He said he was hit in the chest but did not lose consciousness right away.
“I saw him fire two shots at Nonoy, who fell to the ground beside me and started running out of breath,” he continued. “Then he fired another shot at Nonoy. Thoroughly frightened that I might be shot again, I closed my eyes and played dead.”
Morillo said he recognized Formilleza but only found out his name later on, when the police filed a complaint against him in the city prosecutor’s office for direct assault against an agent of a person in authority by resisting arrest during the tokhang operation.
The policemen had even claimed in media interviews that Morillo and his companions were caught smoking meth, and even dubbed them notorious drug suspects and robbers.
“Nevertheless, the policemen themselves admit to shooting me and my companions. They are claiming that the shooting was in fulfillment of their duties in relation to an antidrug operation,” he said. “They claim that we resisted and fought back. However, these allegations are baseless and are mere fabrications.”

Less than five hours later, Christina Padual and a man identified only as Alvin were also gunned down by unidentified suspects who fled on three motorcycles.
The victims were shot dead in front of a beerhouse on Commonwealth Avenue. The police recovered two rolled-up aluminum foils with suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride or “shabu” from the woman. 
Around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, two men in black jackets and wearing face masks reportedly entered a house at St. Peter Street in Barangay Holy Spirit.
Police reports said the suspects shot dead the sleeping Lorna Adalid, 56, and Mark Astrologo, 22. A woman, who was with her two sons in an adjacent room, told the police that the suspects looked for Adalid’s son, Francis, but he had already escaped by destroying the roof of the house.
The gunmen then fled in  a white van.
With the rising number of the so-called deaths under investigation in the city, Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, QCPD director, said his team would enhance efforts to lessen the killings.
“It is the responsibility of every police station to prevent the deaths by placing several checkpoints and encouraging curfews in their area,” Eleazar said, noting that Oplan Sita would be strengthened, as most killers use motorbikes as their getaway vehicles.

“We will also work harder to investigate the cases that have already happened,” he said.
With the anticipated revival of the government’s campaign against drugs, Eleazar said the QCPD would reactivate its antidrug units to lead the operations.
The District Drug Enforcement Unit will now be directly under QCPD’s intelligence division. Station Drug Enforcement Teams will be under the supervision of the intelligence division of each police station.
Eleazar said the QCPD would employ the same operatives under the disbanded District Anti-Illegal Drug (DAID) units and their station-level counterparts.
He said these officers were already vetted, as he had removed all previous antidrug operatives in QCPD when he took office in July.
“But we will still continue evaluating them,” he said, noting that the QCPD had been doing its “internal cleansing” alongside the drug war.
The ranking officer said Oplan Tokhang was dropped due to its “tainted” image.
“This time, the police will work directly on drug enforcement. There will be no more pleas for surrender,” Eleazar said. “Only the local government will continue efforts to encourage surrenderers and rehabilitation.”

He said his fellow legal counsels reported that “just the other day, two dead bodies were disposed (of)” near Daa’s house–something he said was “like a veiled threat against our clients.”

In a previous Philippine Daily Inquirer article, Lascañas said he left the country because he had been receiving threats that a lawsuit would be filed against him, and people were looking for him as well.
Lascañas said the moment he received these pieces of information, he
realized it was better to leave the country “for the time being.” 
In February, Lascañas made a stunning turnaround from his statements last year at a Senate investigation where he denied involvement in the DDS, as well as allegations made by another self-confessed DDS member, Edgar Matobato.
Lascañas admitted to lying when he first appeared at the Senate, saying he did so out of fear for his family’s safety.
In his press conference on Feb. 20, Lascañas accused President Duterte of organizing the DDS to kill petty criminals and his enemies in Davao City. Lascañas was then assisted by his lawyers from the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) led by its national chairman Jose Manuel Diokno, and supported by opposition Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV.
From then on, Lascañas has been provided safe haven by a number of supporters, some of whom helped him in his flight out of the country.
Malacañang had denied the allegations Lascañas made, saying these were part of the plan to “destroy the President and topple his administration.”  SFM

Beleaguered NBI Director Dante Gierran on Thursday let the ax fall on Ricardo Diaz, the bureau’s head in Metro Manila, after he was implicated in the kidnap-slaying of Korean executive Jee Ick-joo.

Three other senior officials of the NBI, the primary law enforcement unit of the Department of Justice, were also sacked by Gierran in the wake of President Rodrigo Duterte’s outrage over Jee’s killing.

He said the drug problem was now regarded as a “national security threat,” which would allow him to deploy soldiers in antidrug operations.
No trust in NBI 
“The bureau is suspended from enforcing drug laws. You’re included. I have lost trust in you,” the President said.
He said only the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, headed by his longtime security aide Isidro Lapeña, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines were authorized to carry out drug raids.
“I still have to (issue) a proclamation (or) executive order, but I have taken in the AFP and raise the issue of drugs as a national security threat,” he said. “They can call all the Armed Forces to assist… in the meantime that there will be a cleansing, a purge inside Camp Crame and the NBI,” he continued.
Diaz, a longtime NBI agent, has been accused by Supt. Rafael Dumlao III, one of the primary suspects in Jee’s  murder, of having a hand in the incident, which reflected the susceptibility of the President’s merciless drug war to abuses.
Also sacked were Roel Bolivar, the erstwhile head of the NBI Task Force Against Illegal Drugs, who was replaced by his deputy, Jonathan Galicia; NBI-Metro Manila head agent Darwin Lising; and the NBI deputy director for investigative services, Jose Yap.

The NBI deputy director for intelligence, Vicente de Guzman III, took over Yap’s position, while lawyer Sixto Burgos replaced De Guzman.
Joint investigation
According to Gierran, he and PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa met on Wednesday with Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who had presided over the Senate inquiry into Jee’s murder and other similar cases of “tokhang for ransom.”
He said the PNP and the NBI agreed to create a joint investigation team and cooperate closely in resolving Jee’s case.
Gierran said Medardo Delemos has been tasked to head the NBI team while Senior Supt. Glenn Dumlao, chief of the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG), was assigned to lead the police investigators.
Glenn Dumlao was previously indicted in the celebrated kidnapping and murder of publicist Salvador “Bubby” Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito.
Lacson, then the superior of Glenn Dumlao in the now-defunct Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, was also charged in the Dacer-Corbito double murder case.

A piece of paper placed next to the victim’s body had a handwritten message in Filipino that read: “I am a drug pusher. Don’t be like me or you will end up dead, too. My fellow pushers, leave this place if you still value your lives!”
But according to Barangay chair Felicito Valmocina, Sanchez was not involved in illegal drugs and that fellow local officials can vouch for his being “clean.” 
“Perhaps his only involvement is when he relayed information to me about suspected drug users, when he was the head of our barangay public safety office three years ago,” said Valmocina, who had worked with the victim for more than two decades.
Valmocina surmised that the killers may have left the “pusher” sign to mislead the investigation.
Aside from being deputy administrator, Sanchez also headed the barangay’s urban settlers affairs department and usually served as mediator between private lot owners and informal settlers, the village chair added.
Calling Sanchez his “strong asset,” Valmocina said his work in the department resulted in more than 30 private lots being cleared of squatters.
He also recalled that Sanchez tested negative when random drug tests were conducted in their barangay.

It was one of those conversations with her husband that Mylene Son would never forget.
On the night of Sept. 15 this year, Police Chief Insp. Jesus “Jim” Son told his wife: “Baka hanggang ngayon o bukas na lang ang buhay ko  (My life might end today or tomorrow).”

Her husband was no stranger to death threats, Mylene said. Known as a tough police officer in Leyte, Son was not the type who would be shaken by any threat. But that night, Mylene said, he talked about being killed like he was so sure it would happen and that he knew who would do it.
“He told me who threatened him and that he also told his closest friend about it,” Mylene recounted.FEATURED STORIES

On Monday, Dec. 5, Mylene will face the Senate inquiry on invitation by the committee headed by Sen. Panfilo Lacson. “Sasabihin ko ang lahat ng katotohanang nalalaman ko  (I will tell all that I know),” she said.
Son told Mylene about a direct threat from Supt. Marvin Marcos, Region 8’s chief of Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG). 
“Mainit daw sa kanya si Supt. Marcos kasi hindi niya ginawa ang inuutos sa kanya na  ‘project.’ Gusto daw tignan kung hanggang saan talaga ang tapang ng asawa ko  (He said Marcos was mad because he did not do the project assigned to him.  My husband said Marcos wanted to see how far he’d go in defying him),” Mylene said.
Son and Marcos were not on speaking terms because in a previous local election, Marcos’ wife, Marites, had run against Edgar Empillo Sr., Son’s father-in-law, for the vice mayoral post in Pastrana town, Leyte. Son’s father-in-law won, while Marcos’ wife placed third in the race.
Making amends
Then sometime in August, Marcos started talking to Son again, Mylene said, adding that her husband thought it was because the CIDG head wanted to make amends for his previous hostility.
Son did not realize that Marcos was trying to lure him into doing a very sensitive “project,” Mylene said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


The “project” targeted someone who had identified key personalities involved in the proliferation of illegal drugs in Eastern Visayas, as well as government and police officials who had received protection money for the illegal drugs trade of Kerwin Espinosa.
Mylene said her husband told her the “project” was a hit on Albuera, Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa. “Marcos asked my husband if he has an asset who could kill Espinosa for a P500,000 fee. Son said he’d look for one; he felt pressured to do it. Then a close relative and friend advised my husband not to do it because Mayor Espinosa was under the witness protection program. He just might become a fall guy,” Mylene recalled her husband telling her.
On the night of Sept. 15, Son on his joint Facebook account with his wife, posted this message, “Pulis sa pulis … putangina mo!!! offer ka nga, naka witness protection program naman …. tapos double cross mo kami … ala ka bayag … subukin mo ako hamunin nang harapan … I’m sure may mamamatay sa atin!!! Wag mo ako traidurin!!! Di kita uurungan! (Cop versus cop … son of a whore!  You made an offer on [a guy under] the witness protection program then you dare double cross us. You have no balls. Why don’t you fight me face to face? I’m sure one of us will die. Don’t double cross me! I will not back down).”
Ambushed
The message was addressed to Marcos, according to Mylene. At that time, Mayor Espinosa was still in the custody of Albuera Police Chief Inspector Jovie Espenido.
The following day, Son was ambushed by unidentified assailants along the national highway of Barangay Piilit, Sta. Fe in Leyte province. Initial investigation reports said the ambush was work-related because Son was a former intelligence officer of Leyte’s Anti-Drugs Group and had received recognition and commendations for several antidrug operations.
“That morning, he was so happy.  He woke me and said, it’s Friday, I’ll be attending the flag-raising ceremony,” Mylene recalled. Her husband also promised to go home after the flag-raising ceremony to help a neighbor who had been robbed.
“He left past 6 and I texted him saying I’ll wait for him at the Snack Haus so we could go home together,” Mylene said. But until 9 that morning, there was no response to her message. At past 9, Son texted back. “Pauwi na ako (on my way home)” and she had responded, “OK. Love u.” It was the last communication between husband and wife.
By 10, Mylene got suspicious when some friends checked on her. Was she at the Snack Haus? Was she with her husband? they wanted to know. “My friends knew that no matter how difficult it was for me, I would always go with my husband wherever he might be assigned.  I want someone to converse with,” Mylene said, not knowing that her friends already knew about her husband’s ambush when they called her.
On Nov. 5, Mayor Espinosa was killed by a CIDG team led by Marcos inside a subprovincial jail in Leyte.


Powerful backers?
Weeks after that, Mylene sought the Inquirer for help, fearing that Marcos would go after her and her children next.  She wanted to talk as early as three weeks ago but became hesitant when she saw Marcos’ demeanor during the Senate inquiry led by Lacson.
“Ang lakas ng loob niya, parang may ipinagmamalaki. Paano ka magsasalita laban sa taong ganun kalakas ang loob na parang nakasandal sa pader?  (He sounded so sure, so confident like he has powerful backers. How can you talk against someone who has such strong connections?)”
Recently, Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa revealed that someone higher than him had asked that Marcos be reinstated as CIDG Region 8 Director.
Soon after, as speculation grew about Dela Rosa’s compadre who had interceded for Marcos, President Duterte himself admitted that it was him, through Secretary Bong Go, who had ordered Marcos’ reinstatement.
He needed the CIDG head back in his post, the President said, because he was still conducting an investigation on Marcos and was trying to piece together his  connections in the illegal drugs trade.

Crime scene investigators recovered one fired cartridge from a .45-cal. pistol and a heat-sealed sachet of suspected “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride). A placard was also found inside Tulalian’s green tricycle, calling him a “drug pusher” who should not be anyone’s role model.
Ancyl claimed Tulalian never peddled drugs, but said there was talk “in the neighborhood that he uses [shabu] but I do not believe them.” 
“I always check him every time he sleeps, and I only find a pack of cigarettes, nothing more,” she said.
Waiting for Calixto
Tulalian’s wife expressed disappointment at Mayor Antonino Calixto’s silence on the string of drug-related deaths in the city. “I know he will talk during the Pasay Day celebration, but he doesn’t say anything about the killings that happen left and right here in Pasay, unlike other mayors I saw on TV who ordered their police to do something.”
Reached for comment, Calixto said his office had been receiving reports of deaths under inquiry, a police euphemism for extrajudicial killings. But he said his hands were tied because there were no formal complaints filed.
“There are only two complaints filed in the police. The other families are not filing cases with proper authorities,” the mayor said.

He was referring to Hara Kazuo, the widow of Jaypee Bertes, who was killed by policemen along with his father inside a Pasay police precinct in July,  and Rachel Bermoy, whose live-in partner, Eric Sison, was shot dead by Pasay police in Barangay 43.
Calixto said he already ordered police to solve the cases as soon as possible, and frankly asked them if they were involved in the deaths.
“They denied this, saying others fought with operatives and most were killed by motorcycle-riding suspects,” he said. “Many were killed but Pasay has been more peaceful compared with the previous years,” the mayor claimed, saying there were fewer people loitering in the streets at night.
The mayor brought flowers at Tulalian’s wake at Veronica Memorial Homes, but Sammy, the victim’s younger  brother, said what they needed was justice.
Brother’s story
Tulalian’s fellow tricycle drivers at Gumban said someone may have planned his death. According to Sammy, two women were seen waiting at the tricycle terminal past 9 p.m. on Wednesday.
The two, however, refused to ride other tricycles other than Tulalian’s. They asked to be dropped off at Cuneta Astrodome.
Ancyl, however, said she could not think of anyone who could plot her husband’s death. “He used to be a barangay tanod and people here even urged him to run as barangay councilor. He had no crime record,” the wife added. “He was a good man.”
Ancyl, who is eight months pregnant, said her husband was also a good father to their two children aged 11 and one./rga

According to Donna, Halcon was a single man who enjoyed the company of his three friends and his dog Blackie.
The dog, also one of the witnesses to the killings, has not moved since from the bottom of the stairs leading to the second floor where his owner was killed. 
“Maybe he is waiting for Uncle Bernie to come home. We don’t know how to tell him he’s gone,” Donna said.
According to Halcon’s neighbors who refused to be identified for fear of their lives, six men on three motorcycles went inside their compound, two of them remaining at the entrance to serve as lookouts.
At that time, Halcon was watching television with his 18-year-old niece and her friend, in addition to his friends: Roland Santos of Barangay Rosario, alias Onay of Barangay Caniogan and alias Jayson of Cubao, Quezon City.
All of them were herded upstairs to the second floor of the house where Halcon’s niece and friend were ordered to go inside one of the rooms. They were not harmed.
Halcon and his friends, however, were shot dead. Crime scene operatives later recovered 29 slugs and casings from an unknown firearm, as well as a sachet of what was believed to be “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).

A police investigation showed that Halcon was a drug pusher whose name was on the barangay’s drug watchlist.
Barangay officials, however, said that Halcon had earlier surrendered under “Oplan Tokhang” as a drug user, not as a pusher. But one official said he did not know that the victim was involved in illegal drugs, adding that he thought Halcon was a professional “tambay” (bum).
Santos, on the hand, was a “self-confessed” drug user and pusher who had also surrendered to authorities.
The police report, meanwhile, mistakenly identified Jayson as a resident of Maybunga and a drug pusher in the barangay. Local officials, however, said that he was there to have his business permit processed because he wanted to store vegetables in Halcon’s house.
Donna said she was hurt when people, especially the police, were quick to brand her uncle a drug pusher.
“He used to be a pusher but he cleaned up his act. Why was he not given a chance to change for the better?” Donna asked. She lamented that the police used the same “script” when her other uncle was killed.
“We already know that we cannot get justice because no one identified the killers. We just want my uncle’s name to be cleared,” she told the Inquirer.

Soldiers, apparently using Mr. Duterte’s call to the military to help the Philippine National Police fight illegal drugs, use the crackdown to go after suspected communist rebels and their sympathizers.

In October, four members of a farmers group in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan province, were arrested and jailed on trumped-up drug charges, according to the human rights group Karapatan.
“There were more political killings under (Aquino’s) first five months than there are now, but it’s hard to compare. What we see is the killings continue … The impunity of past administrations continues,” Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay said.FEATURED STORIES

CONTRIBUTED PHOTO
CALAPAN CITY—Anticrime crusader Zenaida Luz not only defended the poor and the weak in her community, but first and foremost, also protected her family.
When they were young, Luz’s parents often fought and ended up hurting each other. Being the eldest in a brood of 13, Luz grew up sheltering her siblings from her family’s woes.

“To protect us against the fighting at home, Ate would take us all to the farm and make us hide behind coconut trees,” recalled Perlita Alvarez, 48, Luz’s sister. “She would always tell us: don’t worry, I’ll find us a way out of poverty.”
Their parents, both fishermen in Oriental Mindoro province, could not afford to send the children to school, but Luz, who dreamt of becoming a lawyer, was persistent.FEATURED STORIES

In high school, she worked as a store helper and made sure “she came home even late at night or else we would not have anything to eat,” Alvarez said.
Luz then moved to Marinduque province and worked as a house helper for relatives, who supported her through college. 
“She was the smart one. She did not become a lawyer but she knew a lot from reading books about the law,” Alvarez said.
Instead, Luz became a teacher and taught high school for a while in Marinduque. She moved back to Oriental Mindoro, where she joined the Citizens Crime Watch (CCW), an anticrime civic organization, and headed its Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan (Mimaropa) chapter.
Luz, 51, was gunned down on Oct. 9 in front of her rented apartment that also served as CCW’s office in Barangay Maligaya in Gloria town, Oriental Mindoro. Her attackers were two pairs of motorcycle-riding gunmen, according to witnesses.
As the attack happened, policemen in Gloria were on their way to respond to a road accident nearby.
Alerted by the shooting incident, they instead ran after the fleeing gunmen. The first pair managed to escape but the second was cornered in Barangay Quinabigan in the next town of Pinamalayan.

A shootout ensued and just as the police approached the wounded gunmen, one of them screamed, “Tropa! Tropa (Troops)!”
Extrajudicial killing
They turned out to be Senior Insp. Magdaleno Pimentel Jr., then with the police’s Provincial Public Safety Company, and Insp. Markson Almeranez, then police chief of Socorro town. Police reports said Pimentel wore a ski mask, while Almeranez wore a woman’s wig.
CCW founder and lawyer Jose Malvar Villegas Jr. said the case of Luz was the “first concrete incident of extrajudicial killing” under President Duterte’s watch.
That the gunmen turned out to be ranking police officers also caught the attention of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
Luz, a widow, left three adult children, the youngest of whom is 20 years old.
Alvarez said her sister would side with her, no matter what. “I lost my own defender,” she said.
Soft inside
“[Luz] was very vocal, especially when she believed she was right about something. I think she must have learned to become strong early in life,” Alvarez said.
But to Luz’s live-in-partner of five years and fellow CCW member, Richard Albert, Luz “was strong outside but very soft inside.”


On the night of the murder, Albert said Luz had been receiving text messages from someone claiming to be a drug pusher. The person said he needed CCW’s help to protect his wife and child.
Despite Albert’s warning not to trust the person, Luz stepped out of their house to meet him.
Death, instead, waited for her.
Insp. Ruel Lito Fronda, Gloria police chief, confirmed the exchange of messages from Luz’s phone, which was recovered from the scene. He agreed the text messages were only a ploy.
“Like you, we also meddled into other people’s business,” Albert told the Inquirer.
He said Luz helped build up several cases against local government officials and her recent work involved paralegal services to victims of land disputes, drug abuse, rape and even members of indigenous communities.
She was also putting together a livelihood project for former drug users in Socorro, a reason she had met Almeranez sometime in August.
Albert said they did not personally know Almeranez or Pimentel.
Blow to PNP
The involvement of the two police officials was a blow to the Philippine National Police.


Pimentel and Almeranez were both graduates of the Philippine National Police Academy.
In September, Almeranez was awarded as outstanding police officer by PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa in a ceremony held here.
“[They were] among the best operators [in Mimaropa],” said Senior Supt. Christopher Birung, Oriental Mindoro police chief, citing successful police operations led by the two officers.
But records from the police Regional Internal Affairs Office showed that Pimentel was charged with “grave misconduct and serious irregularity in the performance of duty” in relation to a 2015 antidrug operation here. There were allegations of “excessive force” during a drug bust that left two suspects and one policeman dead.
A police source, who requested anonymity, believed Luz was a “contract kill” and Pimentel took the job “because he needed the money to settle the [2015] case.”
And whoever ordered the hit may have been someone that Almeranez could not refuse, the source said.
Ready to die
Alvarez said Luz seemed to be ready to face death anytime.
“Ate always said: If it is your time, it’s your time,” she said.
In 2013, gunmen fired at Luz’s previous house in Bansud town. This happened again last year in Luz’s house in Gloria.


Alvarez said they did not know if the attacks were related.
The family, represented by Juan Tria of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, and Villegas of the CCW, filed a case of murder against Pimentel and Almeranez at the Regional Trial Court Branch 42 in Pinamalayan on Oct. 28.
A separate case of direct assault and frustrated homicide was filed at the Municipal Trial Court by Gloria policemen wounded in the shoot out.
Pimentel and Almeranez stayed under hospital arrest in the Medical Mission Group Hospital here for two months. It was only on Wednesday night when they were sent, under heavy security, to the Gloria police station where they were detained. On Thursday, they were transferred to detention facilities in the towns of Pinamalayan and Bansud, respectively.
Fronda said it took them awhile because Pimentel and Almeranez could not settle their hospital bills immediately and the court had not issued a warrant or a commitment order until Thursday.
“We may be up against big people here but we trust the police,” Alvarez said.
Fronda believed they have a strong case against Pimentel and Almeranez, and were also close to filing charges against the two other gunmen who had escaped./rga

ILOILO CITY—At least 11,100 protesters on Panay, Negros and Cebu Islands joined activities commemorating Human Rights Day on Saturday, decrying the burial of the late President Ferdinand Marcos at the heroes’ cemetery and the continued extrajudicial killings (EJKs) of suspected drug personalities.
At least 5,000 marched on the streets of Capiz, 3,000 in Iloilo, 1,500 in Bacolod, 1,500 Aklan, and 100 in Cebu.

Protesters led by the Bagong Alyasang Makabayan and Capiz Environmental Protection Alliance converged at the Roxas City bandstand where a program was held. In the morning, a 40-vehicle protest caravan against mining activities passed around towns in the province.
About 1,000 protesters in Estancia town, Iloilo marched along the main streets and later burned a mock figure of Marcos. The protesters, many of whom were survivors of the Nov. 8, 2013, Supertyphoon “Yolanda,” also demanded the release of assistance for those affected by a massive oil spill during the supertyphoon.FEATURED STORIES

In Iloilo City, about 2,000 protesters attended Mass and a program organized by the Marcos No Hero Movement-Panay and the human rights group Karapatan at the Freedom Grandstand.
The activity was joined by martial law survivors, students, religious groups and professionals. 
They later marched to the grounds of the provincial capitol where the activity ended.
In Bacolod City, about 1,500 protesters joined a Human Rights Day rally at the Bacolod public plaza, calling for peace and justice for the victims of the Marcos dictatorship.
The Concerned Citizens of Negros (CCN) also held a torch parade and rally organized by the groups Block Marcos and IDefend in the evening.
Lawyer Andrea Si of CCN said the burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani was not just the burial of his remains but an attempt to bury the truth about the gruesome atrocities during his regime.
“The Marcos’ administration imprisoned 70,000 of his critics, killed 3,000 Filipinos and tortured 35,000 others, all to perpetuate his hold on power,” a CCN statement said.

“The attempt to blur the evils of martial law occurs at a time of rampant extrajudicial killings, threats to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, exclusion from the Cabinet of known oppositionists, sinister Congressional initiative to amend the 1987 People Power Constitution, and subservience of the Supreme Court and the legislature, coequal branches that are supposed to check and balance the power of the president,” according to the statement.
In the capital town of Kalibo in Aklan, about 1,500 protesters assembled at the Kalibo-Numancia bridge before marching to the Pastrana Park where a program was held.
Among those that joined the protest of Rise Up Aklan and Bayan was the group Dekada 80, composed of those who were part of the resistance against the Marcos dictatorship.
“Marcos’ burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani is a grave crime against the historical and victorious struggle of the people against martial law,” said Franklin Quimpo of Dekada 80.
In Cebu, two protesters wearing masks of Marcos and his wife Imelda led about 100 militants in marching to Fuente Osmeña rotunda on Saturday afternoon.
“Imelda” was carrying a baby who wore a face mask of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Teody Navea, secretary general of Sanlakas Cebu, said Duterte was shaping out to be like a dictator.
“We would like to challenge Duterte to eliminate drugs in the country but there should be no human rights being violated,” Navea said.

Two hours earlier, 45-year-old manicurist Evelyn Coloma was shot and critically wounded in Purok 2 in Barangay Pineda.
Coloma’s daughter was in the toilet when gunshots were heard. She rushed outside and saw her bloodied mother slumped on the ground and the gunmen fleeing on a motorbike. 
Coloma remained under observation at the hospital as of Saturday. Like in Pangcoga’s case, the Pasig police said Coloma was also on the local list of users and pushers.
Around 11:30 p.m. Friday, 26-year-old Gerard John Amandi, was shot dead along Esguerra Street, Barangay Pinagbuhatan, also in Pasig.
Around 9:40 p.m., 32-year-old Jhonace Ryan Dotaro was shot dead on Villa Tupaz Street in Barangay San Joaquin while eating dinner with his partner. Four assailants barged into the house and shot him in the head and body, before escaping.
Hot spots
Barangays Pinagbuhatan, Sagad, Pineda and San Joaquin are considered hot spots of illegal drug activity in Pasig, where 112 cases of vigilante-style killings—which the police euphemistically call “deaths under investigation”—have been recorded since July.

Elsewhere in the metropolis, the families of three more men tagged by the police as drug suspects would be spending Christmas in mourning.
Medel Maglonat, 40, a notorious drug pusher in Parañaque City’s Marcelo Green barangay was gunned down around 8:45 a.m. on Friday by men on a motorbike.
In Pateros, two residents included on the watch list were also killed on Friday. The victims were identified as John Lester Certeza, 41, of P. Rosales Street,  Barangay Sta. Ana; and a man known only as “Baton,” who was shot on M. Almeda Street, Barangay Sto. Rosario-Silangan.
Pateros police chief, Supt. Joel Villanueva, noted that the three attacks had something in common: They involved four motorcycle-riding hit men wearing helmets and bonnets.
As hundreds marched to mark Human Rights Day on Saturday, President Duterte’s office said it wanted the police to investigate the thousands of deaths blamed on vigilantes.
More than 5,000 people have been killed in the antidrug campaign, either by unknown vigilantes in drive-by shootings or by policemen who supposedly shot them for putting up a fight during arrests. Some have been found abandoned on the streets, their bodies mutilated.
The activists urged the government to put an end to the killings, warning that growing public discontent could lead to a fate similar to that of deposed dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
They said Mr. Duterte should concentrate on solving grinding poverty, which they claimed was the root cause of the drug menace.
“The vigilante groups are being prodded by his pronouncements that encourage impunity. If you say [to the police] that ‘I have your back, just do your job,’ that is an open encouragement for these violations to continue and for gross violations of the law [to be committed],” Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay told the Inquirer.
Palabay noted that it would be wise for Mr. Duterte to “rethink” now his government policies, particularly toward human rights, or else he would soon “face challenges in his presidency.”


“Historical experience showed us that even if open fascist rule exists, the citizens still fight back,” she said, pointing to the Filipinos’ triumphant struggle against the Marcos dictatorship three decades ago.
Under Marcos’ dictatorship, 3,257 were killed, 30,000 were tortured and 70,000 were arrested for opposing his mailed-fist rule. He and his family went into exile in Hawaii in February 1986 following a bloodless revolt.
In Defense of Human Rights and Dignity Movement (iDefend) stressed it was important for the public to speak up and become the “critical opposition,” which would urge the President to do what is right and proper.
“The number of those killed in ‘Oplan Tokhang’ has increased,” added Irma Balaba of the National Council of Churches of the Philippines. She said that while the poor were grieving, the police were “having a party shooting and killing.”
“It’s said that a regime that said it espouses change is showing signs of being a fascist state,” she said.
Reject
Assistant Communications Secretary Marie Banaag stressed the government rejects extrajudicial killings, which she claimed were all being investigated by police.
Mr. Duterte, who has lashed out at critics of his antidrug campaign, had said that the vigilante-style deaths were not state-sponsored and were due to in-fighting among rival drug gangs. He has bristled at international calls for him to observe human rights, cursing US President Barack Obama, the United Nations and the European Union.
He has since softened his tone after a phone conversation with US President-elect Donald Trump, whom he said supported his unrelenting and bloody campaign.
The President recently vented his ire on human rights defenders who he said blamed him for ordering the deaths.  —WITH REPORTS FROM JOVIC YEE, LEILA SALAVERRIA AND KRISTINE FELISSE MANGUNAY

As the bodies kept piling up, “Maria,” who grieves for one of the latest victims, sighed in anguish: “I voted for someone who is now killing our own children. That’s what people are telling me nowadays.”
Afraid to give her real name in this report, Maria is a relative of Nick Villegas, a 37-year-old tricycle driver who became the 10th resident of Barangay Mangahan, Pasig, to be killed by unidentified assailants since July, according to the police. 
Earlier complaints
Villegas, a father of six, had been the subject of complaints in the barangay over his drug use and was on the local watch list of known pushers of “shabu,” said Edgardo Casili of the village security force.
He earlier surrendered to the police under the Oplan Tokhang antidrug campaign but continued using drugs, Casili said of the victim in an Inquirer interview Tuesday.
According to a report reaching Senior Supt. Orlando Yebra, Jr., the city police chief, Villegas and his live-in partner Josa Marana were knocking on the house of his father Gaudencio on Quezon Street when they were shot by one of two men on a motorbike around 1 a.m. Tuesday.
Villegas died on the spot while Marana took a hit in the stomach. She was brought to a hospital where she was set to undergo an operation.

Witnesses recalled spotting at least four motorcycle riders who were waiting in the area moments before the shooting. One rider was seen texting while another sped off apparently when he noticed he was being observed.
Barangay Manggahan desk officer Domingo Becinal said that about four hours before Villegas was shot, he was accosted by village watchmen for creating a disturbance in the neighborhood and was released around 12:50 a.m.
 
Two more Pasig kills
An hour earlier, also in Pasig, construction worker Jessie Pagaduan Jr., 34, was shot dead along Eastbank Road, Barangay Sta Lucia.
Barangay security force members told the investigator, SPO1 Hermel Vergara, that Pagaduan was included on the local drug watch list and had also  surrendered under Tokhang.
Around 7:40 p.m. Monday, Rolando Nebril, 30, was also shot dead while taking a rest inside his house that stood along a creek in Lu   pang Pari,  Barangay San Miguel, also in Pasig.
Like the other two victims in Pasig, Nebril was also a known user and pusher in the barangay, Yebra said.
In Mandaluyong, Milton Castillo, 27, was shot dead by four men on two motorcycles around 1:30 pm on Tuesday along Neptali Gonzales Street in Barangay Harapin ang Bukas, according to the local police report.
Makati attack


In Makati, Randolf Arevalo Greyon, 21, and Ace Funollera Bacorro, 18, were having a drink with friends on Rockefeller corner Binay Streets in Barangay San Isidro, when four gunmen on motorbikes appeared out of nowhere around 2 a.m.
The two back riders then pulled out pistols and fired several shots at Greyon while Bacorro and his others friends ran away. The attack was captured on a closed-circuit television camera in the area.
The shooters chased Bacorro and shot him in the chest, before fleeing toward Batangas Street.
Both victims were pronounced dead on arrival at San Juan de Dios Hospital in Pasay.
Makati police chief Senior Supt. Milo Pagtalunan, quoting barangay officials, said both suspects were suspected drug users or pushers in the area.
No record?
But the Inquirer checked the records of the Makati Police Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) and did not found the name of the victims.
A SAID officer, however, said there were two persons on its database whose information matched those of the victims, but under different first names: Steven Bacorro Arevalo, 21; and Joel Funollera Bacorro, 18; both residents of Rockefeller Street.
These two men and another Rockefeller resident surrendered under Tokhang on Aug. 24 and were listed as “occasional users”. They were not included on the drug watch list.
Different names


The SAID officer explained it was not unusual for drug personalities to alter their personal information, especially their names, when surrendering to authorities.
In Quezon City, three women and a man were gunned down in separate incidents from Monday night to early Tuesday morning, according to the police
According to a report to Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Quezon City Police District director, Gloria Melgar, 42, and Anthony Parilla, 24, were killed by mask-wearing men around 7 p.m. Monday on Kasayahan Street, Barangay Batasan Hills.
A witness, who turned out to be Melgar’s sister, was reportedly walking along the road with the two victims when one of the gunmen yelled at her: “Go away! Don’t come closer! Run!”
Drug tests
She followed the order and immediately ran, before hearing successive gunshots and later finding the victims bloodied on the pavement.
QCPD reports said Melgar and Parilla were invited to the barangay hall earlier in the day for a drug test.
In the same barangay, around Tuesday midnight, Herminia Laros, 45, was at the wake of her neighbor on Congressional Road when shot in the face also by gunmen on motorbikes. Laros died on the spot.
Two hours later, in Barangay Payatas, Analyn Baquilar-Tolentino, 41, and her companions were playing cards also at a wake on Mayon Street, when six assailants on three motorcycles opened fire on the group.
Tolentino later succumbed to multiple gunshot wounds at Far Eastern University Hospital. Four other people at the wake were also wounded.


Dumped in toilet
In Pasay, the body of a drug suspect who was also branded as a “fixer”—or someone who offers to expedite government transactions or work around regulations, usually through bribery—was found inside a toilet of a house on Electrical Road, Barangay 191, around 2 p.m.
A police report identified the victim as 44-year-old Darwin Nazareno of Barangay Halang, Naic, Cavite. A placard found next to the body carried the message: “I am a fixer, a liar, a drug user. Do not emulate.”
The owner of the house where the body was found was not immediately known.

Espinosa, 54, was arrested on Oct. 5 for illegal possession of drugs and firearms. He pleaded not to be taken to the Leyte subprovincial jail in Baybay City, saying he feared for his life there but his plea was ignored.

Under the command of Supt. Marvin Marcos, a CIDG-Region 8 team conducted a predawn operation to serve a search warrant on Espinosa, whom they suspected to be keeping a gun and “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) inside his Baybay cell.
Espinosa and another inmate, Raul Yap, were killed in the raid. The two allegedly fought it out with the CIDG team.FEATURED STORIES

On Oct. 26, prior to Espinosa’s killing, Marcos was relieved, according to Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa, after he was named by the mayor’s son Kerwin, an alleged big time drug lord, among officers receiving drug protection money. At that time, Kerwin was under arrest in Abu Dhabi, where he had fled.
Dela Rosa said he had received instructions from President Duterte to reinstate Marcos, immediately after he issued the relief order. Dela Rosa said Marcos was facing an internal affairs service inquiry anyway. 
Marcos during the Senate hearing on Dec. 5 was asked to explain the swiftness of the President’s intervention and whether he had high-level connections.
He said that the relief directive had come much earlier on a case filed against him in June and that the President probably referred to that case, not about Kerwin’s alleged revelations in Abu Dhabi.
On Nov. 7, two days after the killing of Espinosa, Marcos was relieved again on orders from CIDG headquarters in connection with the Baybay jail incident. Three days later, Dela Rosa ordered the administrative relief of all policemen involved in the death of the mayor.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson in a Senate inquiry on the case said the mayor’s killing appeared premeditated.
On Nov. 23, the younger Espinosa, in a testimony before the Senate, said that Marcos was on his payroll, receiving a total of P3 million to fund the election campaign of his wife who was running for vice mayor in May. Marcos denied this.

3 neighbors slain
One operation ended in the killing of a man known only as “Buhay” and his unidentified companion.   Another drug-bust  cornered their neighbor, 30-year-old scavenger Constantino de Juan. 
The QCPD said two .38-caliber revolvers, a .45-caliber pistol and five sachets of suspected “shabu” were recovered from the three slain suspects.
Around 7:30 p.m. in Barangay San Bartolome, a police team was scouring the area along Ivory Riverside when Alvin David, 25, suddenly pulled out a handgun and engaged the officers in a gunfight.
David was brought to Quezon City General Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.
Tokhang surrenderer
Investigation showed that David surrendered in July under Oplan Tokhang but continued using drugs. He was also being linked to robberies and motorcycle thefts in Novaliches.

The police found a sachet of shabu in David’s pocket.
Three hours later, in Barangay Bagong Silangan, garbage collectors Jerry Baldoza and Ronaldo Morales were killed also in a buy-bust operation, the QCPD said.
A “shootout” erupted between the suspects and the officers, killing Morales on the spot.
Baldoza managed to run to his house but was also shot dead by pursuing officers.
On Wednesday, Jessie Malamug was killed after allegedly firing at QCPD men in a drug sting in Barangay Greater Fairview around 2:45 a.m.

At 9:25 p.m., Jonathan Penasbo and a dozen of his friends were celebrating a birthday near his house on Block 34, Welfareville Compound, drinking the night away as they sang the Eraserheads song “Ligaya,” when four masked men approached.

Cornered inside toilet
As the strangers ordered the group to lie face down on the pavement, Penasbo and some of his friends ran away. One of the gunmen chased Penasbo up to his house, cornering him in the toilet, where the 22-year-old was shot twice in the face. 
 ‘Very wrong’
In an interview the following day, Penasbo’s mother Janet said her son did use drugs but that he did not deserve to be killed. “Maling-mali ang ginagawa ni Duterte (What Duterte is doing is very wrong),” she said, referring to the bloody war on narcotics being waged by President Duterte, whose pronouncements since the election campaign season practically endorsed vigilante-style attacks on suspected users and pushers.
As she broke down, Janet held a laminated photo of the youngest son she had just lost, taken when Jonathan  went to Quiapo church in January. She said Penasbo left behind a 4-year-old daughter.
According to a report reaching Senior Supt. Joaquin Alva, Mandaluyong police chief,  Penasbo was on the drug watch list of Barangay Addition Hills and allegedly served as a “runner” or drug courier for Eleazar Sarvida.
Sarvida, 61, was killed that same night, about five minutes after the shooting of Penasbo.

He had just arrived home in Addition Hills, after a meeting with fellow Jehovah’s Witnesses church members, when he was shot in the face by one of two men who waited for him at his front gate. He died on the spot.
One of Sarvida’s colleagues in the church maintained that the victim didn’t drink, smoke or take illegal drugs for “that’s in our rules.”
Watched by intel unit
But according to PO3 Donald Banes, the case investigator,  Sarvida was on the watch list of the city police intelligence unit, which had also received information from the barangay saying Sarvida’s wife was also into drugs.
Sarvida’s previous spouse was charged with drug pushing and died in jail, Banes said, and his son faces an arrest warrant for three counts of rape.
Around 9:45 p.m., motorcycle-riding gunmen also shot and killed Michael Desvarro, 39, near a convenience store on A. Bonifacio Street, Barangay Hagdang Bato. Desvarro, who police said peddled drugs along with cigarettes, lived a block away from Penasbo at Welfareville.
But Desvarro’s cousin, Airylyn, belied this, saying he had been eking out a living selling cigarettes, his daily struggle made harder by the fire that destroyed his house in November. Desvarro and his family had since been staying in a crowded evacuation center, Airylyn added.
An eyewitness to Desvarro’s killing said the shooter was holding a photo when he approached his target.
4th victim of the night
Around  11:30 p.m,  40-year-old Anabelle dela Cruz, a resident of Sto. Rosario Street and a drug surrenderer in Barangay Plainview, suffered the same fate.


The attack on Dela Cruz, however, also wounded 15-year-old Tenica Perez, who was walking on the same street when hit in the right leg by a stray bullet.
Dela Cruz was later pronounced dead at Sta. Ana Hospital, while Perez remained confined in another hospital for her gunshot wound.
Dela Cruz was on the barangay watch list of drug users, according to Banes.

On Monday, QCPD operations also ended in the death of four more suspects.
A man known only as Jomer was killed round 2:30 a.m. in Barangay Greater Fairview by members of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) unit of QCPD-Fairview. Jomer was described to be 25 to 30 years old and had tattoos on his arms. 
Around 7:40 p.m. that same day, a QCPD-Batasan operation on Nawasa Road, Barangay Holy Spirit, killed Joel Parian, 35, and Leo Pacula, 55. Both men were reported to be on the police watch list, with Pacula’s house on Nawasa Road allegedly being used as a drug den.
In Barangay Sauyo in Novaliches, the police conducted an entrapment operation against Henler Baduya and his brother, Lito.
But only Baduya was home when the officers entered his house at Sitio Cabuyao, where he allegedly initiated a shoot-out after a drug transaction.
The QCPD said eight sachets of shabu and a .38-caliber revolver were recovered from slain Baduya.
The incidents raised the number of drug suspects killed in police operations at 237 since July, according to Eleazar.

QCPD’s tally of “deaths under investigation” or killings carried out by unidentified assailants stands at 208. Of this number, Eleazar said, only 36 have been confirmed by investigators to be drug-related while 21 were found to have nothing to do with the war on drugs.
The remaining 151 cases are merely suspected of having links to illegal drugs, the official explained.

These are just some of the images included in the compelling photo slide show “Tokhang,” which has been making rounds on social media.
The chilling images, paired with short videos of relatives mourning and haunting background music, are from several photojournalists covering the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. 
The photographers, who are affiliated with different news organizations, work at night to document the bodies recovered from police shootouts and vigilante killings. They also cover funerals and mass surrender of drug users.
A brief background on the issue is included in the video. It states President Rodrigo Duterte’s campaign promise to rid the country of the drug trade by killing up to 1000,000 people involved in illegal drugs within six months.
“For decades, the Philippines has been plagued by poverty, rampant corruption, and stark inequality. Experts believe that the drug problem is just the symptom to more fundamental problems,” the video says.
It enumerates the results of the drug war—more than 5,000 people killed and 700,000 surrendering to authorities because they fear that they will be assassinated next. However, some of those who surrendered ended up dead as well.
“Almost all of [those killed] were small-time drug peddlers and users, and mostly citizens who live below the poverty line,” the video states.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


“Tokhang” is a term that comes from the Visayan phrase “Tok-tok Hangyo,” which has been used to refer to police knocking on doors of illegal drug suspects and asking them to surrender.
Photographers who contributed to the video are Alyx Arumpac, Dante Dionisia, Ezra Acayan, Linus Escandor, Carlo Gabuco, Jay Ganzon, Vincent Go, Czar Dancel, Raffy Lerma, Alecs Ongcal, Hannah Reyes, Dondi Tawatao. It was edited by Jes Aznar who is also a local photojournalist.
Total silence
Aznar told INQUIRER.net over the phone that he presented the video at the Angkor Photo Festival in Cambodia earlier this month.
The venue was full and many of the participants looked forward to seeing the images of Tokhang from the Philippines, he said.
Asked how the audience reacted to the video, he said there was “total silence.”
Aznar said he wanted to share with his fellow photographers images from “the most important issue in the Philippines” right now.
“We were all bothered by what’s happening and on our part we are not able to have all our pictures published. The people need to see this, the public needs to see this,” he said.
Aznar said that while photojournalists should not be political, it is their job to show the people what is really happening.
“Of course this is also a matter of life. It’s a simple ethical question… As a human being you should have a stand on that—that it is wrong if there is no due process,” he said.


“There are still a lot of people who are cynical, skeptic (and will say), ‘That is not true. That is staged,’” he said, referring to images of people killed in police shootouts and by unidentified gunmen.
So it came to a point when his fellow nightshift photojournalists wanted to bring members of the public with them.
“They need to take this seriously. We wanted to invite people with us so they can see the police operations every night. They can stay as long as they want until they are satisfied,” Aznar said.
“So we’re just doing our job. And as a human being, we’re doing our part para at least mapa-realize yung mga tao na parang may mali (to make people realize that there might be something wrong here),” he said. RAM

The Volunteers against Crime and Corruption (VACC) founding chair, Dante Jimenez, urged President Duterte to create a special task force to investigate the deaths from stray bullets, mistaken identity or accidental shooting in drug-related shootings carried out by the police and criminal syndicates.

In his Jan. 3 letter to Malacañang, Jimenez said the special task force should be composed of prosecutors or commissioned lawyers who would complete the probe of the cases involving innocent victims within 30 days from the start of the investigation.
“The above recommendation will ensure that the people who have been affected by the ‘collateral’ damage will remain faithful to the government’s thrust of a peaceful and drug-free community,” Jimenez said.FEATURED STORIES

Special courts
As a complementary move, Jimenez also wrote Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to designate special courts to handle the cases involving innocent victims and monitor the cases closely to ensure that they were resolved within the prescribed period. 
Jimenez told Sereno that “an increased number of innocent people are expected to fall victims as ‘collateral damage’ in the war against illegal drugs considering the magnitude of illegal drugs in the country.”
According to the Philippine National Police, from July to December 2016, there were 2,928 deaths under investigations or murder cases not automatically connected with the war on drugs or immediately attributed as extrajudicial killings.
Mr. Duterte has apologized for the deaths of innocent victims who were caught in the crossfire.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson has urged the President to consider giving justice and  granting compensation to the innocent victims of his drug war. Lacson has suggested that Malacañang at least give burial assistance or scholarship grants to the families of the innocent victims.

Hours after Santiago was shot, an anonymous caller informed the police that he was involved in the Dec. 11 shooting of drug suspect Domingo Mañosca, 44, which also killed his son, 5-year-old Francis.
Police called in a balut vendor who testified that just before father and son were shot dead, he saw two riders on a motorcycle near Mañosca’s house. 
The vendor said the back rider got off and walked toward Mahogany Street where Mañosca lived.
The witness said he later heard gunshots and saw the suspect emerge from the alley and escape with his cohort.
SPO1 Dennis Desalisa, investigator on the Mañosca case, said the witness positively identified Santiago as the motorcycle back rider.
Investigators are still awaiting the results of the ballistics and cross-matching tests on the Norinco .45-cal. recovered from Santiago to confirm the connection.
Mañosca, a pedicab driver, had earlier surrendered to the Pasay police under the government’s “Oplan Tokhang.”

He was fixing a DVD player inside his house on Dec. 11 when someone knocked on the plywood window of their house, his wife said.
When Mañosca asked who it was, the gunman fired through the plywood panel. The bullet struck in the forehead Francis who was asleep on the floor beside his mother and two siblings.
A second bullet hit Mañosca in the nape, exiting through his cheek and killing him. His wife said he was not a pusher although he used “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to stay awake and work longer hours.

Initial police investigation showed that the victims were heading home to Barangay Pakna-an after Loberanes posted bail for possession of illegal drugs and firearms at the Mandaue City Palace of Justice in the reclamation area.
Four men on board two motorcycles blocked the path of the van, about a kilometer away from the Palace of Justice. 
Loberanes was the city’s first drug suspect who surrendered in June 2016 shortly after Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, ordered the implementation of Oplan Tokhang, a campaign in which policemen go from door to door, persuading known drug users in communities to surrender and submit to rehabilitation.
He went to the Mandaue City Police Office (MCPO) in the evening of June 8, 2016 and turned over to the Investigation and Detective Management Branch (IDMB) packs containing shabu and a pistol with ammunition.
Loberanes then told police that he wanted to start a new life.
He was later released from detention because there was no case filed against him.

MANILA — Armed men stood in front of a chapel on Quintos Street as they watched their accomplice shoot and kill a transgender who went by the name Heart on Tuesday night in Navotas.
Heart’s neighbor, Antonio Sigue said six or seven men in black jackets stood there as they waited for the gunman to finish the job in front of a shanty about 20 steps away.

When the gunman was done, Sigue heard him say: “Okay na.”
Sigue said the shooter casually walked away “as if nothing happened” leaving Heart, whose real name was Alvin Ronald de Chavez, bathing in his own blood that seeped from his face and chest.FEATURED STORIES

When Heart’s 61-year-old mother Elena found him minutes after the killing, she lifted his head and embraced her only son.
“I tried to carry my son. I’m not sure if he’s still alive but his body was soft and warm. There were no words coming out of his mouth,” Elena de Chavez told the Philippine Daily Inquirer. 
“Then I told him ‘di ka kasi nakikinig sa amin (you did not listen to us),'” she added.
Barangay San Jose Kagawad (village councilman) Boyet de Guia said Heart was on the barangay’s drug watch list. Heart was encouraged to surrender but De Guia was not sure if he turned himself in.
De Guia said he wanted Heart’s case investigated to help identify the gunmen.
Elena said Heart started selling drugs in November 2016. He got into the business, which helped him earn P500 a day, to help feed his family.
“We already told him not to sell drugs but he said ‘ma, pangkain lang (ma, this is just to buy food),'” Elena said.

Elena and her eldest daughter Analyn de Chavez said Heart was arrested by Manila policemen in Pritil, Tondo, last Sunday. He did not have drugs at that time but they confiscated his cell phone, which contained messages of drug transactions.
Analyn said the police used that as evidence against Heart. They were not able to get the policeman’s name.
Elena added that cops in Pritil did not file a formal case against Heart “because the police asked us to pay 50,000” for his release. Elena said they could only come up with P10,000. The cops accepted the money and set Heart free.
Three days later, armed men wearing face masks and black jackets barged inside their shanty in Navotas about 11:30 p.m. They collared Heart and grabbed him outside.
Then, one of them took Heart in front of a shanty with a tiny pink door about 30 meters away. The rest stayed in front of the chapel, the only place in the alley that was well lighted.
Four shots rang.
“We saw them walk away. They were laughing,” Elena said.
Elena and Heart’s other sister Arriane called his death “brutal.”
“They shot him in the face and chest. That’s too much. That’s too brutal,” Arriane said.
The bullets pierced his brain, lungs, liver, and parts of his heart. “Just the shot in the head is enough to kill him but they still shot him several times,” Arriane said.


The De Chavezes and Sigue said the gunmen were tall and burly, and were all wearing face masks and black jackets.
While Elena talked about her son, Analyn pulled a turquoise picture frame that had two photographs and the word love. Analyn gave it to Elena who said: “look at him Mam.” Elena pointed at pictures where Heart looked and dressed like a woman. “He’s so pretty. What a waste,” Elena Saud.  SFM

After what happened on the night of Nov. 8, 11-year-old John Ryan and his nine siblings are spending their first Christmas as orphans.
They were all asleep when armed men barged into their shanty at the Market 3 area of the Navotas Fish Port Complex and grabbed Joaquin Garbo. The siblings saw how their father was dragged out of the house while still in his underwear.

John Ryan’s mother and eldest sister, aged 17, immediately went to the Station Anti-illegal Drugs (SAID) unit of the Navotas police, but the officer who faced them said Garbo wasn’t there.
Yet according to Garbo’s sister Melody, “my niece and her mother heard (Joaquin’s) voice at the station, pleading with the police not to hurt him.”FEATURED STORIES

Hours later, around 4 a.m., Joaquin was found dead on Kanduli Street in Barangay North Bay Boulevard South, his hands tied behind his back.
An official report by PO3 Allan Joey Ogatia III said the victim died of multiple gunshots. Chief Insp. Shirleen Ballete, chief of the Northern Police District crime laboratory, said three sachets of suspected “shabu” were found in Joaquin’s possession. 
‘Igaganti ko si Papa’
Melody, who was in Palawan province when she learned of Garbo’s death, admitted that her slain brother served as a drug pusher’s “runner” or courier while employed at the port as a stevedore. But more than a month after the family tragedy, she said she’s most worried about John Ryan, who had become detached, brooding, and given to tears.
The boy, she said, would often say: “Igaganti ko si Papa. Pinatay nila, kinuha nila; natutulog lang (I will avenge Papa. They killed him. They took him while he was asleep.”
“He has said that four times already,” the aunt said in an interview last week. “He’s just a boy and maybe he says things he doesn’t really mean.”
She recently saw John Ryan playing with a toy gun and aiming it at some imaginary target. She took it off his hand, telling him to stop: “That’s bad!”

“But it’s just a toy,” the boy replied. “It’s not even mine. It’s just plastic—
not like what they used to kill Papa.” The toy gun, which the boy got from a neighbor, ended up in the trash heap.
‘Beyond expectations’
While the police and the media keep count of the suspects killed in the Duterte administration’s 6-month-old war on drugs, the number of children who have lost parents as a result remains a matter of extrapolation.
Hope Hervilla, assistant secretary for protective services at the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), could only make a “conservative estimate”:
About 18,000, the DSWD official said in an Inquirer interview. “This is beyond our expectations. We did not expect it to be this big.”
Eighteen thousand children can fill up around 450 standard-size classrooms, 300 buses, or 900 jeepneys. If they are to be gathered inside Araneta Coliseum, the place would be jam-packed and about 1,500 additional seats would be required.
Grim computation
Hervilla said she arrived at the figure by multiplying 6,000—the number of people reported killed in the drug war from July to December, assuming they are all parents—by three, which she cited as the average number of children per Filipino couple.
The latest tally released by the Philippine National Police showed that its nationwide operations have killed 2,138 “drug personalities” from July 1 to Dec. 23. Going by the DSWD official’s formula, this results in 6,414 children left without a parent because of police operations.


The number of “deaths under investigation (DUIs)”—as what the PNP calls cases like Garbo’s—stands at 3,993 as of Dec. 12.
State’s responsibility
Hervilla said the DSWD would start collating data about the drug war orphans this January. An interagency meeting is set to discuss the children’s needs, the official said, as she acknowledged that there is still no government program specifically designed for such orphans.
“The children, they are the state’s responsibility,” Hervilla stressed.
Dr. Danilo Tuazon, a forensic neuro-psychologist and psychology professor, said such minors need immediate care and psychological intervention, especially if they saw how their parents were killed.
“Immediate means treatment should start right after the killing, habang nakaratay pa magulang nila (while the parent’s wake is ongoing). The children need to immediately understand what happened.”
It should include “anger management and stress debriefing” so the child may eventually cope, Tuazon said. Without it, “the damage will last a lifetime.”
“How do you tell a child that his or her parents were killed because of drug pushing but at the same time tell the kid that killing is wrong?”
Children in the prepubescent stage are most fragile, he stressed. “It is during this time that their brains are being wired on what they should become or how they should view society.”
They will never be OK


 
“At first they would seem OK, of course, because they are kids—but they are not OK. They will never be OK. Chances are they would nurse deep anger inside their hearts and it would affect them as they grow up.”
Told of John Ryan’s story, Tuazon sees “a big possibility of retaliation,” but explained that it’s “the normal reaction when you are in deep pain and angry. When you’re suffering, you want others to feel your pain, too.”
Orphans like them may need a new environment to fully recover, he said.
Which is what Melody, John Ryan’s aunt, had in mind for her 10 nieces and nephews. She wanted all of them out of their neighborhood, blaming it for their father’s involvement in drugs and his violent death.
Time to leave town
With the family’s main breadwinner gone, John Ryan was forced to find work as a harvester of mussels (tahong) in Navotas. But on Dec. 22, Melody finally decided he should no longer remain there after the boy was caught “stealing fish” from one of the trucks at the port.
When scolded, the boy explained that he just wanted to help feed his siblings.
With a friend’s help, Melody was able to secure a space for the boy on a ship going to Palawan. “He was crying when we left. He kept asking me: Who will feed my brothers and sisters?”
Thanks to another relative, three of the Garbo siblings are spending Christmas in Masbate province, while two had been adopted by one of the Garbos’ neighbors in Navotas.


Melody said she hopes to return this January for John Ryan’s three younger sisters—aged 12, 7 and 4—and move them to Palawan as well.
As to their widowed mother, Melody said she too urgently needs counseling. “I can’t even talk to her properly anymore.”
Still at the Navotas fish port community, the Inquirer also encountered Sam, a 12-year-old boy who last saw his mother on the day she was arrested along with several other residents for alleged drug peddling. The woman died of sickness while in jail.
‘Can we watch Tokhang?’
Sam wants to be a policeman someday so he can “discipline” the force.
As the interview ended and this reporter was about to leave, Sam suddenly started singing a Christmas carol, swaying his head to his own tune. This was the same boy who had just confided that “I don’t cry anymore,” that he had shed his last tears at his mother’s funeral.
Beside Sam was a 9-year-old playmate who had watched the interview. This other boy noticed this reporter’s smartphone and asked: “Ate, can we watch Tokhang on your phone?’”
Oplan Tokhang refers to the PNP campaign that has compelled thousands of suspected drug users and pushers to “surrender” and be registered so they can be referred for rehabilitation and other government interventions.
Many surrenderers, however, would later die—either at the hands of the police or unidentified gunmen. The 9-year-old apparently had this in mind, where “Tokhang” had taken a different meaning: “It’s fun watching people get shot and fall dead.”

We turn our camera lights on and we see the blood immediately—puddles of dark red beside dried yellow leaves.
Two men were killed here earlier in the evening after an “encounter” with policemen who had just finished conducting antidrug visits in the neighborhood. 
It has been more than an hour since we began our graveyard shift and left the busy streets of Makati City, where shoppers and office workers bask under the bright lights and glitter of Christmas decorations, seemingly oblivious to the spate of killings that has hit poor neighborhoods in the metropolis.
It’s the winter solstice and this night is the longest of the year, just a few days before Christmas.
Since President Duterte assumed office on June 30, more than 6,000 people have been killed—more than 2,000 shot dead in police operations and the rest murdered by unknown assailants.
Critics of the drug war believe these assailants either work for the police or are policemen themselves, taking the law into their own hands to help Mr. Duterte deliver on his campaign promise of stamping out illegal drugs in six months, which he has since extended by another six.
A number of those killed are innocent, some as young as 5 years old. Many come from poor communities.

11 p.m. Barangay Addition Hills, Mandaluyong City
Unlike the avenues of Makati, the streets in the inner city are quiet and devoid of Christmas cheer.
Aboard our vehicle, we wait for new reports of shootings, hoping to arrive before crime scene investigators process the spot and the undertaker takes the body away.
Jong Manlapaz, veteran reporter of Radyo Inquirer, receives word that there are two  bodies in Mandaluyong City.
Tope, his driver and cameraman, revs the engine and speeds through the late-night traffic to bring us to Block 34, Barangay Addition Hills.
We are the first reporters on the scene. The neighborhood is awake. People stand outside their houses, observing the police.
Bobot Sarvida was killed inside his house by unidentified gunmen. His body is wedged between the jamb and the door, which opens out to an alley.
Bobot Sarvida is shot dead by unidentified men inside his house in Block 34, Brgy. Addition Hills, Mandaluyong on December 21.
We cannot see his head, but we see his white, long-sleeve shirt stained with blood.
Neighbors say Sarvida was a Jehovah’s Witness minister and had just come home from service.
A small, black, long-haired dog stands beside Sarvida’s body, barking at us. It stays with its owner even as we leave.


Another man, Jepoy Pinasbo, was killed in the area around the same time by four unknown gunmen, but his body had already been taken to the hospital.
We ask how the two victims are related, but no one can say for sure.
According to a radio report, Sarvida was shot by the same men who killed Pinasbo after the minister witnessed the murder.
Newspaper reports the next day said Pinasbo was on the local drug watch list as a  courier for Sarvida.
Midnight, Barangay Hagdan Bato Libis, Mandaluyong City
With no time to lose, we head for a neighboring village where another man was shot dead.
Barangay Hagdan Bato Libis is a three-minute ride away and we immediately see a crowd gather around the body lying in the middle of the road, just several steps away from a 7-Eleven store.
Michael Desvarro, a 39-year-old cigarette vendor, was killed on A. Bonifacio Avenue.
Michael Desvarro, a cigarette vendor, is also killed by four men on motorcycles along A. Bonifacio Ave., Brgy. Hagdan Bato Libis, Mandaluyong.
His head is covered by newspaper. From there, my eyes move to the small pool of blood beside him and the stream of red that has flowed down the road past the police line.
Like Sarvida’s body, Desvarro’s has yet to be taken away more than an hour after he was shot dead.


Witnesses say Desvarro was gunned down at 9:45 p.m. by four motorcycle-riding men.
Another report said the gunman was holding a picture when he approached Desvarro, who police claimed had been selling drugs besides cigarettes.
Desvarro’s wife, May Anne, insists that he was not a drug addict and was instead the target of harassment by his stepfather, a Mandaluyong policeman who has gone Awol (absent without leave).
May Ann Desvarro says her husband Michael was being threatened by his stepfather who is a policeman
1:30 a.m. Barangay Plainview, Mandaluyong City
There is no rest for the weary and soon we are alerted to another shooting in a place just 10 minutes away from our third crime scene.
Press vehicles choke narrow Santo Rosario Street, where a certain Annabelle de la Cruz was shot dead by a group of assassins.
Witnesses said 10 motorcycle-riding men who wore balaclavas and black jackets came after De la Cruz.
Two of the men fired at her. A stray bullet hit a 15-year-old girl walking along the same alley.
De la Cruz, who earlier surrendered to police in response to the government’s antidrug campaign, died in hospital.
The teenager suffered a gunshot wound in the leg and was treated in hospital.


On the drive back to Addition Hills, fellow reporter Julliane de Jesus points out that multiple killings in a city in one night would have merited the setting up of checkpoints.
But there are no checkpoints tonight, only several bodies and a wounded innocent girl.
There are also no answers to our questions on whether the gunmen in the three shootings in Mandaluyong are from the same group.
2 a.m. Barangay Addition Hills, Mandaluyong City
Back at Block 34, our video reporter Cathy Miranda searches for the house where Pinasbo was killed.
A couple lets her and Tope inside the rented house where the young man had staggered into in his haste to shake off the assassins.
Video footage brought back by Cathy show blood splattered on a colorful children’s mat and a spent bullet casing inside one of the homeowner’s shoes.
The bathroom where Pinasbo was gunned down is spattered with blood. In the middle of the floor is a small candle lit by the owners of the house.
President Duterte, in a recent speech, said fewer people were being killed. “There are only a few left,” he said, referring to drug suspects.
But the killings go on.


Residents fear becoming collateral damage in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, and even for those who have surrendered, there seems to be no salvation.
In the inner cities of Metro Manila, there is no Christmas this year.
And for the families and friends of the victims, the longest night of the year has just gotten longer.

At 9 p.m. Wednesday, the masked men who were on motorcycles did not know where to find him so they fired into the two adjacent shanties in Phase 8, Barangay 176 owned by Santor’s parents.
The teenagers, along with their friends, Kenneth Lim, 20; and Edward Villanueva, 18; were in one of the shanties where a dance party was in full blast. Lim was also killed while Villanueva was wounded and taken to a hospital for treatment. 
In the other shanty, three of Santor’s relatives—his mother Cristina, 45; brother Ednel, 22; and sister Analyn, 28, who was pregnant—died. Santor, meanwhile, reportedly escaped by diving into the creek behind their house.
“My son just turned 16 and they killed him like a chicken, as if he were an animal,” said Espinosa’s mother, Maria Isabelita.
When interviewed by the Inquirer, she, along with relatives of the other victims, were standing outside Crystal Funeral Parlor where they were begging authorities to release their kin’s bodies so that they could go to another establishment with cheaper rates.
According to the teenagers’ mothers, none of their children were drug users or had criminal records. Their only fault was being friends with Santor, they added, angry at claims that the boys were involved in the drug trade.
Segovia’s father, coconut vendor Jimmy, leaned on a car for balance as he gasped for air. “My son is innocent,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Espinosa turned 16 last month while Soriano turned 16 in September. Segovia, on the other hand, just turned 15.
Just minutes before their death, they were in their respective houses. Then, Villanueva invited them to a party at the Santors’.
Abby, Soriano’s sister, said Santor’s uncle had put up a gang called Scout Royal Brotherhood and recruited the boys. It was normal for them to hang out at the Santors’ house every now and then, she added.
“But my brother does not use drugs. He does not even smoke cigarettes because one time, we caught him smoking cigarettes and we beat him up. So he stopped. Now they telling us he’s using drugs?” Abby said.
One thing the boys had in common was poverty, the reason why they were killed, according to Maria Isabelita, Espinosa’s mother.
“If the suspect is rich, they’re set free. If they’re poor, they end up sprawled on the street,” she said.
She added: “The killers who did this will never have peace. “They may escape from the law of man, but they will pay. They will pay! There is a God.”
Maria Isabelita and the other relatives had another complaint as well.  “Why do they want us to pay P40,000 when we can pay just P7,500 at another funeral home? We are poor, we don’t have money. Our children already died and they still want to rob us,” she said.
Hours after the massacre, she and the other kin of the victims were pleading with the police and employees of North Star Funeral Homes—the police-accredited funeral home which earlier picked up the dead—to turn over the bodies to them.
Since they were not given the right over their lives, maybe the families could have, at least, the right to handle their death?


When the funeral home refused, the families blocked the vehicles bearing their dead. “You cannot take them and make us pay a fortune. We have no money to pay you. Give us our dead,” said Segovia’s sister,  Jenny.
A policeman later assured the relatives that the bodies would be brought from North Star to the one they had chosen: Alexander Funeral Homes.
However, the remains were taken to Crystal Funeral Homes instead. But before the bodies could be unloaded, the victims’  families arrived and blocked the process.
Another standoff started, this one lasting from midnight to 1:45 a.m. until the police and funeral home management relented, finally releasing the victims’ bodies.

(NBI agent Vicente Amisola was killed on Feb. 11, 1994.–Ed.) 
Matobato said the DDS was going after kidnappers when the group came upon Amisola’s vehicle blocking a narrow street. He said one of Mr. Duterte’s men got into an altercation and then a gunfight with Amisola.
He said Amisola, who rolled under his pickup truck as he was being shot, was killed by Mr. Duterte, who emptied two Uzi magazines on the NBI agent.
The Inquirer could not independently confirm Matobato’s allegations.
Matobato, 57, who has been shuttled to different safe houses in the past months because he fears for his life after publicly testifying against the President in a Senate hearing in September, sat on a green monobloc chair at the edge of a small shed where his wife cooked his meals.
Behind him is a piece of land that slopes downward, into a narrow stream—the only background the team was allowed to shoot on video.

Asked if he had firsthand knowledge of Mr. Duterte killing people, he said, “Marami na (There’s been a lot.)”
“Minsan gabi yun pumupunta basta pinakaimportante ang binabaril (Sometimes, he went to the quarry at night if the person to be shot was someone important),” he said.
“Hindi namin alam ang pangalan (We did not know the names),” he said of the victims, who were all male.
“Pumupunta yan. Sya ang bumabaril. Nakaupo ang tao (He would go there. He would fire while the person was seated).”
During the Senate justice committee inquiry on extrajudicial killings, senators made fun of Matobato as he narrated how Mr. Duterte killed the man using an Uzi submachine gun.

Last week, Matobato was interviewed by CNN for an exclusive report where he basically recounted his testimony in the Senate, implicating Mr. Duterte in the alleged activities of the DDS.
Matobato said he never saw Paolo Duterte, the President’s eldest son and now Davao City vice mayor, shoot a man. But he said Paolo asked the DDS to kill some of his enemies, including a man he argued with at a gas station.
Asked if Mr. Duterte’s other children were involved with the DDS, he said no.
Matobato said Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the President’s daughter, had criticized Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa when he was still Davao police chief because of a large number of unsolved killings in the city.
Matobato said his first kill, shortly after the DDS was formed by then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, involved shooting a suspected robber at a billiard hall called Lucky 13.


He said he simply walked up to the man and shot him at close range as bystanders ran in fear.
He said he did not wear a mask. He said in Davao City, he had nothing to fear because he was with the police.
Matobato said the people could choose to believe him or not but he said the increasing number of people being killed nationwide was proof of the existence of groups like the DDS.
Since Mr. Duterte became the President, more than 6,000 people have been killed in the war on drugs. A large number of the deaths are attributed to vigilante groups or unidentified gunmen.
Matobato pointed out that “Oplan Tokhang”—the police campaign against illegal drugs—started in Davao City.
He said the problem was that those killed were small-time drug pushers. He said the DDS did not kill any drug lord in Davao City.

CALBAYOG CITY — A barangay chief and his companion were shot dead on Thursday morning while on their way to meet Mayor Ronald Aquino of Calbayog in Samar.
Chief Insp. Angelo Pueblo, Samar provincial intelligence chief, identified the victims as Roberto Habilles Jr., 38-year-old chairman of Barangay Dinagan, and Novilito Ygbuhay, a 41-year-old farmer from the same barangay.

Pueblo said the killers left a note on the body of Habilles that read: “Oplan Tuklaw! Huwag tularan Kap adik at tulak ng druga! UGDS-EV-8.”

Pueblo said investigators were still trying to figure out what UGDS-EV-8 stood for, as it was the first time they had encountered the initials, apparently the name of a group.
According to the intelligence chief, Habilles and Ygbuhay were on their way to the Calbayog City Hall for an appointment with the mayor to discuss the possibility of Ybguhay taking over the post of his brother, a barangay kagawad, who died last month. 
Barangay Dinagan is about 15 kilometers away from the city proper.
Habilles and Ygbuhay were on a motorcycle traversing a muddy road at around 8 a.m. when unidentified men came out under cover of thick grasses and fired at them.
As the two men fell on the ground, the gunmen approached them and shot them in their faces and heads until they were almost beyond recognition.
Scene of the Crime Operatives recovered empty shells from three types of firearms – an M-16 rifle (5.56 mm), a 9-mm pistol, and a .45-caliber pistol.
Pueblos said investigators were still verifying if indeed Habilles had been using and selling illegal drugs. /ATM

A 69-year-old woman who just happened to be passing by also ended up in the hospital after she was hit by a stray bullet, according to the police. Vivencia Basiloy remains confined at Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center (ARMMC) for a gunshot wound in the ankle.
The shooting incidents happened within a 35-minute period and in three areas that were quite near each other, leading the police to suspect that these were carried out by just one group. Another angle they were looking into was the three surrenderers’ possible involvement in a gang selling diluted “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).FEATURED STORIES

A report to Senior Supt. Lorenzo Holanday, Marikina police chief, said that Alvin Alcanar, 29, was standing on Narra Street in Libis Bulelak at 6:25 p.m. on Wednesday when around 11 bonnet-wearing men on six motorcycles without license plates shot him. He died on the spot.
The police recovered from the scene eight cartridges from a gun of an unknown caliber, two slugs and a sachet of suspected shabu. 
Around 20 minutes later, Renald Pangan, 33, was seated in front of a warehouse on Camia Street in Minahan Libis when he was shot by motorcycle-riding men, according to a report sent to Holanday.
Basiloy was standing nearby and was also hit. Both she and Pangan were rushed to ARMMC where the latter was declared dead on arrival.
At 7 p.m., corn vendor Nelson Ramos, 50, was cooking in the kitchen of his house on Daisy Street, Minahan Libis when unidentified men barged inside and shot him.
Ramos was brought by his relatives to Amang Rodriguez where he remains confined.
Holanday told the Inquirer that Pangan, Ramos, Alcanar had earlier surrendered to Barangay Malanday officials as drug users. The police, however, had information that they were also involved in drug pushing.

At the same time, Holanday said they were also verifying reports the three were members of a drug group which were allegedly fighting over shabu that was being diluted by adding “tawas” (alum).

Witnesses said they heard what seemed to be fireworks before they discovered Mamucod’s body sprawled on the street. “We thought we heard 13 gunshots but the police recovered 23 spent shells,” one of his relatives told the Inquirer.
Although some family members admitted that the victim was a drug user, they objected to the way he was killed. 
“It was overkill. Two shots were enough to kill him but 23? That’s too much. They could have left my brother the moment he fell but they kept on shooting. He was on the watchlist. He used drugs but that was not a license to kill him. He was slaughtered on the road like a pig,” an angry relative who refused to be identified told the Inquirer.
According to the police report, Mamucod was on the drug watchlist of Barangay Kalawaan as a drug user and pusher.
The family said they do not have an idea who would want the victim dead. He left behind three children, the youngest just 8 years old.
The family said they would not pursue a case against Mamucod’s killers for their own safety. “We will leave it to God,” a relative added.
Meanwhile, a 69-year-old drug suspect and former member of the Public Order and Safety department of the Mandaluyong City government was killed by authorities after he lobbed a grenade at them on Monday afternoon.

A report submitted to Senior Supt. Joaquin Alva, Mandaluyong police chief, identified the suspect as Johnny Montecalvo, a resident of Block 37, Barangay Welfareville Compound. He was shot dead in a buy-bust operation inside his house.
Chief Insp. Ricardo Cristobal, chief of the Mandaluyong police’s Anti-Illegal Drugs-Special Operations Task Group, said that Montecalvo was about to sell P200 worth of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to PO2 Mark Banawan when he became suspicious.
The policeman claimed that the suspect took out a grenade and threw it at him, forcing him to shoot. Fortunately, the explosive did not go off as the pin was still there, Cristobal said.
The operation was conducted in coordination with Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency agents based on a tip from residents that Montecalvo’s place was being used as a drug hub by both users and pushers.
Recovered from the scene were two sachets of shabu and illegal drug paraphernalia.

‘War on the poor’
Dechavez spoke to the Inquirer a day after London-based Amnesty International released its report on its investigation of the extrajudicial killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, accusing the Philippine National Police of paying officers and assassins to kill alleged drug offenders, planting evidence and setting up a racket with funeral homes in a “murderous war on the poor.” 
More than 7,000 suspects have been killed by police and unknown assailants since Mr. Duterte launched the crackdown seven months ago.
Amnesty warned that the killings could constitute crimes against humanity and urged the Duterte administration to investigate the murders and punish the policemen involved.
The PNP denied the allegations and Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II brushed aside Amnesty’s findings, saying criminals were not human.
She lost 2 sons
Another mother from Navotas, Maria Mesa de Parine, told the Inquirer that she lost two sons—Aljun and Danilo—four days apart—in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.

Rolando Paredes of Caloocan City told the Inquirer that his son, Rolando Jr., a scavenger who had no means or reason to use drugs, was killed two weeks ago by still unidentified gunmen in Tondo, Manila, in a case of “mistaken identity.”
The gunmen’s real target, he said, was a certain Reynaldo Gutierrez, the name given by police to the funeral parlor where the body of his son was taken.
The three parents joined more than 200 relatives of 70 victims of extrajudicial killings from Malabon, Navotas, Payatas and Bagong Silangan in Quezon City, and Bagong Silang in Caloocan, at the gathering, which began with a Mass concelebrated by Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez and 15 priests.
Church initiative
The Mass marks the first time the Catholic Church has gathered a big number of families of victims to publicly condemn the extrajudicial killings in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.
“There was a previous initiative by Father Nonong (Fajardo) in Adamson University,” said Fr. Joselito Sarabia, director of St. Vincent Seminary in Tandang Sora, Quezon City, and one of the organizers of Thursday’s event in Malabon.
“We are continuing that initiative, with the help of friends, benefactors and other lay people here and in other countries like France, the US, and Papua New Guinea,” he said.
Fajardo, director of the extension program of Adamson University, said the initiative began in July last year, “when the number of deaths was about 1,000. We had Mass for the victims.”
Reaffirmation of support
He said the Church continued condoling with the families of the victims, and then schools started issuing statements condemning the killings, followed by more Masses and photos of the killings exhibited on the premises of the Redemptorist Church in Baclaran, Parañaque City.


The gathering in Malabon on Thursday was for reaffirmation of support for the families of the victims, Fajardo said.
“When these families meet here, they talk to each other and their fears are somehow alleviated. They also feel that the community cares for them and their situation,” he said.
Those who had been killed left behind children, “like this 5-year-old kid,” Fajardo said, pointing to a child at the gathering. “Who will send him to school and look after his needs? So if, say, five men with their own families are killed, at least five or more children will suffer.”
The gatherings move the community to pitch in to raise money to support the children, he said.
Fajardo reiterated the need for the Church and the community to unite and help each other, and allow the families to narrate their experiences and voice out their fears during the gatherings.
Families threatened
He said the perpetrators, after killing the victims, warned the families not to say a word or they, too, would be killed.
“There were times when these perpetrators, despite wearing [balaclavas], were recognized by the victims’ families,” Fajardo said.
“I’m glad that the families are now finally coming out to speak,” he added.
Many of the families are under the care of the Vincentian congregation.


“It had to take the murder of a Korean for this drug war to stop,” Fajardo said, referring to the kidnapping for ransom and murder of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo by policemen inside PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, on Oct. 18 last year.
“But the 7,000 Filipinos killed seemed to be ignored because they were all poor. Now the [military] is being asked to police the police. If they clash, what would happen next?” he said.

William told the Inquirer that two men barged into their house looking for Edicer while four others served as lookouts. “They told me they would just ask my brother some questions, so we were horrified to hear four gunshots.”
According to a neighbor who witnessed the killing, the victim was shot four times—twice in the face and once in the chest and nape—as he was kneeling and pleading for his life. 
“How could he be a drug pusher when he did not even have money for food?” William Sorima asked. The family, however, admitted that Edicer was an occasional drug user.
Sorima said his brother had suffered from a psychiatric disorder for nine years and that Edicer just came from a checkup at the National Center for Mental Health in Mandaluyong City.
In Barangay Manggahan, Pasig City, Joven Boñaga, 27, was on his way to buy beer at a sari-sari store on Katimugan Street, Karangalan Village, when he was shot by four men on two motorcycles around 11 p.m. on Tuesday.
Maryln Sabares, the victim’s stepsister, told investigators  that Boñaga had surrendered as a drug user under Tokhang.
A report to Eastern Police District director Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, however, said investigators were verifying if the victim was behind several theft incidents in the area.

Around the same time Boñaga was killed, another Manggahan resident was fatally shot by three men on two motorcycles.
Case investigator SPO1 Al Alvarez said 25-year-old Aldrin De Guzman was on a bicycle going to Tawiran Avenue when the assailants shot him at close range.
Like Boñaga, De Guzman, a resident of Guyabano Extension, Napico, was also in the police’s drug watch list as a user. Investigators, however, were looking into reports that he was a burglar, although his mother maintained that her slain son was just a scavenger.

But the latest tally of “Project Double Barrel Alpha” from the PNP’s national operations center (NOC) showed that since Monday, four more persons died in anti-drug operations.

The PNP, however, is unsure whether the four additional deaths happened overnight or these came from belated reports that reached the NOC.
“We will see the reason why there were still individuals killed in the campaign against drugs. The chief’s order was given (on Monday) morning so baka ongoing na ‘yong police operation when the announcement was made, hindi na nila mabawi (perhaps the police operation was ongoing when the announcement was made and they cannot abort the operation),” PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos told reporters at Camp Crame on Tuesday. 
Night shift reporters, however, covering the killings since President Duterte’s drug war started in July observed that fewer persons, if not zero, were killed overnight. In the past months, reports of drug suspects being killed in the country sometimes went as high as 15 in one night.
Sought for comment, PNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, in an ambush interview, maintained that the police were not behind the killings.
Asked to explain the decline in the death toll, he said: “Ibig sabihin, nag-stop na mga vigilantes sa kanilang gawain dahil kapag ngayon tuloy tuloy sila sa ginagawa nila, pumapatay sila wherein nag-declare na ako na stop our anti-drugs operations, mayroon pa ring namamatay na gano’n, eh ‘di madali na silang habulin at ma-identify kasi sino pang gumagawa niyan.”
(This means vigilante groups have backed off because if they continue they might get caught and exposed.)
Also on Tuesday, the PNP officially deactivated the Anti-Illegal Drugs Group and all anti-illegal drug units and task groups in different police districts and stations nationwide.

In August 2016, her husband and four other men were killed in an alleged shootout with plainclothes policemen from the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) during a drug raid. The operation was part of “Oplan Tokhang,” a component of the Duterte administration’s widely criticized war on drugs.

One of the targets, Efren Morillo, miraculously survived despite a chest gunshot wound. His version of the events that night is different from that of the police: The unarmed victims were shot execution-style.
His testimony became the basis for a landmark petition filed by families of the slain men in the Supreme Court. The first legal challenge against Tokhang, the high tribunal ruled in favor of the petitioners which had sought protection from the police and the suspension of antidrug operations in their area.FEATURED STORIES

But for Maribeth, the significant victory seems hollow. “All I can think about now is getting a better job for our three children,” she told the Inquirer. “But we fear the police, those not on our side.”
Her eldest daughter is 14 years old, followed by two sons aged 12 and 4. All three were in the area when the police barged into their house, cuffed their father and his friends and led them away to a place where they would later be shot. 
While the two older children have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding their father’s death, the reasons behind it are unclear.
Maribeth, however, has other concerns. The weeks after Daa’s death on Aug. 21 saw her frantically raising P47,000 to pay for his funeral.
Now, she relies on her earnings from a small “sari-sari” (retail) store for her family’s basic needs.
To supplement her income, she moonlights as a fruit vendor from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m.
“I earn only P200 a day,” she said. Before his death, Daa was the sole breadwinner, working as a garbage collector and at times, as a construction helper.

But Ella, Jimmy and Sonny may soon lose their mother, too. Maribeth is strongly considering finding employment abroad to provide for her children.
“I don’t know what awaits me in another country. Maybe I will be a domestic helper,” she said, adding: “But at least, I will earn more.”
Despite having a solid case for filing murder charges against the police officers who killed her husband and his four friends, Maribeth seems hesitant, mainly because she is afraid.
But the Center for International Law which provided legal assistance to the petitioners expressed hope the families would continue to fight for justice.
For Maribeth, the bigger fight lies in the everyday struggle to put food on the table. In the many sleepless nights filled with dread, she holds on to one dream where her husband visited her.
“In my dream, I asked him: What do we do now? It’s so difficult,” she said in between tears. “But he told me: You can do this. You can do this.”

The mere sight of her former house where her live-in partner was shot and killed by policemen almost a month ago still makes Ruth Jane Sombrio cry.
After all, the one-room shanty on San Miguel Road in Binondo, Manila, was the reason Rogie Sebastian, a 30-year-old pedicab driver accused of being a drug pusher, ended up being one of the casualties in the government’s war on drugs.

The 40-year-old Sombrio who is seven months pregnant described her partner as a good man. He used to take drugs
but he stopped when President Duterte came into office,
she told the Inquirer in a recent interview.
“I’ve had three husbands. Rogie was the third and the kindest. The other two would beat me up but he was kind to me,” she said.FEATURED STORIES

As Sombrio recounted that fateful night, she could not help but weep. Every time she laid eyes on her old house—just meters away from where she now lives with her mother—a pained expression would cross her face.
“I can never forget how they killed him. He and I pleaded for the policemen to spare his life but they didn’t,” she said. 
The couple and their children aged 1 and 2 years old were fast asleep when uniformed and plainclothes policemen barged into their house at 3:30 a.m. on Sept. 19.
They were looking for Fernan, the shanty owner, Sombrio recalled. A friend of Sebastian’s, Fernan was also rumored to be a runner of shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride).
In their official report submitted to the Manila Police District (MPD), Binondo policemen said Sebastian died in a buy-bust operation led by Chief Inspectors Leandro Gutierrez and Fernando Reyes, and Senior Insp. Edwin Samonte.
Gutierrez is the head of the Meisic police station’s anti-illegal drug unit and Samonte, the intelligence unit chief. Reyes, on the other hand, is commander of the San Nicolas police community precinct. Both stations are in charge of keeping peace and order in the Binondo area, including San Miguel Road, a squatters’ community located beside the Pasig River.
According to the report, PO2 Juan Candelario acted as a poseur buyer and bought P100 worth of shabu from Sebastian who sensed he was a policeman. A shoot-out ensued and Sebastian, who was reportedly armed with a .38-cal. firearm, died on the spot.

Sombrio, however, recalled the events quite differently. For one thing, her partner did not own a gun.
She said that a few hours earlier, policemen on motorcycles were roaming around the area. Worried, she found it hard to fall asleep that night.
Sebastian, on the other hand, barely noticed them. He had a fever and just wanted to rest. Sebastian saw no reason to worry, he told her, because he was not Fernan.
“He was wrong,” Sombrio said. “So what was he? Palit-ulo (A substitute)?” she asked angrily.
When the police entered their house, they grabbed Sebastian and kept on asking him about Fernan’s whereabouts. With his hands up in the air, Sebastian begged for his life.
His kids were still young, he told the lawmen.
Out of fear, Sombrio said she and her partner embraced each other. The children started to cry as their parents became hysterical under the barrels of the policemen’s guns.
“Don’t leave me,” Sebastian told Sombrio.
“Then the policemen shot him in the foot and started dragging me and my kids out of the house. They said it was better for them not to see what was going to happen. I told them, ‘But you already shot him in front of them.’”
Sebastian begged the cops again: “Let me embrace my
children.”


But Sombrio and her children were taken outside their house. Moments later, gunshots rang out. Sebastian would later be found, his body riddled with gunshot wounds on the chest, head and foot.
Sombrio said she doesn’t know who killed her partner.
All she knows is that he was shot in the foot by a mannish-looking woman in plainclothes who first donned a bonnet and a pair of gloves before drawing her firearm. This “tomboy,” Sombrio told the Inquirer, was a policewoman.
When she learned that Sebastian was dead, she went into hysterics, Sombrio recalled.
She wanted to see his body to say goodbye but the authorities would not let her past the yellow tape that cordoned off her house. “I went from one policeman to another telling them that since they were planning to kill my husband, they should have brought a coffin for him, too,” she said.
“They just laughed at me. I was crying and they were laughing at me,” she added.
According to her, Sebastian’s death meant a lot of things: She lost a good man while her kids, including their unborn child, lost their father.
With the funeral home charging her P100,000 for services, Sombrio went to her friends to beg for money to claim his body and give him a proper wake. It took two weeks to come up with the money before Sebastian was finally buried at the Manila North Cemetery.
With the family’s sole breadwinner gone, Sombrio is worried about the future.
“I can’t work because I’m pregnant and no one wants to hire me. Where am I going get the money we need to survive?” she said.


As for filing a case against the police, Sombrio said this was the furthest thing from her mind.
“I want to forget everything. If I had the money, I would
go back home to the province,” she added.
She just wants to get away from the pain inflicted on her by the policemen. “They don’t have a heart or a soul, not even a conscience,” Sombrio said.
In the mornings, each time she sees policemen—whether in uniform or civilian clothes—she goes weak in the knees and cries.
The nights are harder, however, particularly for her 2-year-old son who saw his father being shot.
Sombrio said: “He cries as he looks for his father. He says, “Papa, papa. Wala na (He’s gone). Papa, papa. Bang bang.”

The police are looking at a possible connection between the two killings, noting that Rosales had been making follow-ups on the unsolved case of younger sister Lauren Kristel for the past several weeks.
Rosales was with a female companion waiting for a car outside Dellherts bar and restaurant at the corner of Yakal and Talisay Streets, Barangay San Antonio, when he was shot in the temple by one of the two motorcycle-riding men who approached him at 12:35 a.m.FEATURED STORIES

According to the case investigator, PO3 Rolando Villaranda, Rosales was set to return on Friday to London where he and his wife were working.
Since arriving in the country three months ago, Rosales had been checking on the progress of the police investigation into Kristel’s killing, the officer added. 
He went to the bar on Tuesday night to meet former co-workers, Villaranda said.
Around 7 a.m. on July 21, the 26-year-old Lauren Kristel was shot twice in the back by a fellow jeepney passenger at the corner of J.P. Rizal and N. Garcia (Reposo) streets, also in Makati. A stray bullet grazed the leg of another female passenger.
The police report then noted that the victim, a resident of Sta. Ana, Manila, was carrying a bag full of clothes, which her attacker didn’t touch. The .38-cal. pistol used was recovered at the crime scene.
PO3 Arnis Ojastro, who handles Lauren Kristel’s case, said Petronio constantly communicated with him and that they last spoke at 5:35 p.m. on Tuesday.
The Makati police on Wednesday formed the 10-member Task Group Rosales, with Villaranda and Ojastro among the investigators. It is headed by Supt. Angelo Germinal, the assistant police chief for operations; and Chief Insp. Rommel Resurreccion, the investigation section head.

Both Villaranda and Ojastro said their strongest lead suggested that the killings stemmed from a property dispute.

In a span of 12 hours from Wednesday afternoon to early Thursday morning, five people were shot dead in the latest series of extrajudicial killings (EJK) in Metro Manila.
They included a barangay chair in Caloocan City and four residents in Pasig City.

The Caloocan police said their investigation into the killing of Barangay 53 Chair Prolly Bolo would consider reports that he protected relatives involved in illegal drugs.
Bolo was having a drink with a friend at a junk shop on 6th Avenue in his barangay when shot by masked men on motorcycles around 3:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Senior Supt. Johnson Almazan, the city police chief.FEATURED STORIES

Almazan said his men had received reports that Bolo coddled some of his relatives involved in illegal drugs. “He gave them protection. Up to what extent? We have yet to know,” said the official, who had formed a special probe team for Bolo’s case.
In Pasig, three of the four victims were residents who were earlier included by the local police on their drug watch list. 
Still, the city’s police chief, Senior Supt. Orlando Yebra Jr., said such killings are “not to be considered alarming because (they are) happening everywhere and we have found out that in some cases the killings are perpetrated by drug syndicates.”
“We are investigating all these killings and we have leads,” Yebra stressed in a text message to the Inquirer.
In reports reaching Yebra’s office, the latest four victims were killed by unidentified gunmen in barangays Rosario, Pineda, Caniogan and Maybunga. They were as follows:
Jessie Dabon, 45, who was shot dead in his house at Masikip, Rosario, around 11 p.m. Wednesday;
Mark Anthony Pandes, 30, who was attacked while standing in front of his house along MRR Street, Pineda, around 12:25 a.m. Thursday;

Enrico Espinoza, 27, who was shot around 12:30 a.m. Thursday inside his house along Col. Licsi Street, Caniogan; and
A still unidentified man who was gunned down along Jenny Avenue Extension, Maybunga, around 4 a.m. Thursday; he was described to be 40 to 45 years old, about 5’7” tall, and wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.
Earlier, Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, director of the Eastern Police District which covers Pasig, said the spate of extrajudicial killings in the city could be the handiwork of the Boratong group, which used to operate a “shabu tiangge” or a compound in Barangay Sto. Tomas where drug peddling had gone unchecked for years until the police launched a crackdown in 2006.
In Quezon City, another drug suspect on the watch list of the Quezon City Police District’s Station 10 in Kamuning was killed in a buy-bust operation in Barangay Immaculate Conception early Thursday.
The fatality, identified only as “Fidel,” allegedly fired at the officers who had him entrapped on Aurora Boulevard corner E. Rodriguez Avenue around 1:30 a.m. The QCPD said a .45-caliber pistol, six sachets of “shabu,” aluminum foil strips, lighters and P839 in cash were recovered from the slain suspect.

Bayan Muna Representative Carlos Zarate on Friday denounced the spate of extrajudicial killings during the first 100 days of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.
In a statement, Zarate said while the campaign against drugs is a welcome development, the summary killings of drug suspects by vigilante groups also deserved condemnation.
ADVERTISEMENT







He said these killings should be investigated before they undermine the administration’s bloody crackdown on drugs.
“The relentless campaign, particularly against illegal drugs, is a welcome action considering the magnitude of this public menace, which apparently was taken for granted, if not neglected, by the previous administration. However, the now unabated summary killings allegedly perpetrated by rogue police officers, vigilantes and by members of crime syndicates must also be denounced and should be thoroughly investigated as these may in the end undermine the aggressive campaign being waged by the present administration,” Zarate said.FEATURED STORIES

“There must be no compromise with the already established rules of engagements, due process of law and human rights of alleged suspects,” he added.
Zarate, however, lauded the administration for its independent foreign policy to break away from the United States. 
President Duterte has hinted at scrapping the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement to boot out rotational US forces in the Philippines, and has said this year’s joint war games with the US would be the last.
“Giving life, spirit and credence to the Constitutional edict of pursuing an independent foreign policy, with the interest of the Filipino people and the nation as the primordial considerations. For the longest time, the Philippines has always been perceived, nay, even treated as a surrogate or vassal state and not as an ally of the US, especially in terms of its foreign policy directions,” Zarate said.
“That our past leaders have allowed such treatment is our country’s grave misfortune. But, this major foreign policy tectonic shift will restore the rightful equal place of the Philippines in the community of nations,” he added.
Zarate also commended the administration’s drive to focus on the root causes of the armed conflict in its peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front.
“The focus on addressing the historical and root causes of the armed conflict in the country is a welcome major change in the peace policy of the present administration. It is a departure from the purely capitulation and surrender mindset of the previous administrations,” Zarate said.

“Now is the opportune time to talk peace since there is a deep reserve of goodwill, seriousness and sincerity from both the government and the revolutionary groups,” he added.
Zarate, however, noted the persistent problems of traffic brought about by the “unbridled” importation and registration of cars that choke the streets, as well as the continuing neoliberal policy on privatization, commercialization and deregulation retained by the Duterte administration.
He urged the administration to fix the mass public transport system, particularly the Metro Rail Transit and Light Rail Transit systems. RAM/rga

Caagahan went after Garcia because he suspected the latter of being the police asset or informant who had told authorities about his involvement in illegal drugs, Villanuac said.
Garcia was pronounced dead Tuesday night due to brain hemorrhage. He left behind two sons — one aged six years, the other just two months old. 
According to Villanuac, the Muntinlupa police launched an antidrug operation against the 35-year-old Caagahan on Oct. 10 — a day before Garcia was shot — but failed to find their target.
Caagahan, who has been tagged by the police as a drug pusher, remains at large.
Garcia’s live-in partner, who asked not to be identified for her safety, said he was attacked while on his way to meet her and their two-month-old son that morning. He was supposed to accompany them to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for the child’s antidengue vaccination.
She said they had not seen each other for a month and Garcia just wanted to see their son when he gets an injection.
Speaking to the Inquirer, she recalled that Garcia was among those rounded up by the police under the Oplan Tokhang antidrug campaign on Oct. 8 but he was later released because there were no drugs found in his possession.

“He was too hardheaded. I already told him to distance himself from his friends who are involved in illegal drugs,” she said.

He said law enforcers “were properly trained and knowledgeable on the rights of all crime offenders” and would pull the trigger only when suspects “violently resist using weapons that could endanger the lives of our lawmen.”
Galgo said under the Philippine National Police’s “Oplan Double Barrel,” police operatives in the provinces of north and south Cotabato, Sarangani and Sultan Kudarat, and the cities of General Santos, Cotabato, Koronadal and Kidapawan have already conducted 706 police operations as of Sept. 14. 
Among those killed during police operations were three former police officers in Tacurong City and nine “hardened” drug pushers in Matalam, North Cotabato.
He said 867 individuals had been arrested and police seized more than 1,860 sachets of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride).
In the implementation of “Oplan Tokhang,” another antidrug campaign of the PNP, police in the region visited at least 29,000 homes, Galgo said.
Galgo said in the implementation of Oplan Tokhang, police in the region did not use coercive tactics but used persuasion and acted like heads of families in advising suspects to reform for their own sake.
In Cagayan de Oro City, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said government prosecutors should also focus on cases involving drug personalities.

He also urged them not to succumb to the temptation of being bribed by drug syndicates.

MANILA — The former live-in partner of Quezon City Councilor Hero Bautista has been missing since last week, her family revealed in a report to the Quezon City Police two days after she disappeared.
A report from the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) Eastwood Station revealed that Rio April Santos Choi, 33, went missing last Sept. 12.

Her mother, Emiliana Santos, said she was last seen at around 7:30 p.m. at their condominium in Eastwood City, Barangay Bagumbayan.
Santos said her daughter went out that Monday night saying she would just buy drinking water and meet someone. Choi, however, has not come back, nor communicated with them in any way, since then. This prompted Santos to report the disappearance to the police two days after.FEATURED STORIES

Choi’s name was mentioned in previous reports two years ago when she was identified as the former live-in partner of the city councilor who recently submitted himself for rehabilitation after he tested positive for drugs.
The reports mentioned that a case of grave threat was filed against a certain Wilfredo Valerio, identified as the live-in partner of Choi at that time. A witness allegedly identified Valerio as the suspect in a plot to kill Bautista. 
On Tuesday, reports surfaced that Choi was also involved in drugs and that she was even linked to the slain sister of actress Maritoni Fernandez, Aurora Ma. Moynihan.
“Those are just speculations but that is part of our investigation,” the QCPD chief, Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, said.  SFM

The gunman on a motorcycle tailed the tricycle boarded by Bravo, his live-in partner, and his grandmother after the court hearing.
The bullet hit Bravo’s left arm and body, exited from his right side and hit Columbino’s back. 
The driver was declared dead on arrival at the Pasay City General Hospital at 10:45 a.m.
Bravo was rushed to San Juan de Dios Hospital and remained in critical condition at press time.
The gunman, who was wearing a bonnet and a pair of sunglasses, fled on his motorcycle.
Last Wednesday, a drug suspect who also came from a court hearing was gunned down by a lone gunman on a motorcycle near Makati City Hall.
Rey “Jolicor” Monteroyo, 20, resident of Lanzones Street, Barangay Comembo, was walking with his live-in partner, his sister and a child when he was shot near the corner of Angono and Osmeña Streets around 11:40 a.m., the case investigator, SPO3 Rico Caramat said.

Monteroyo’s live-in partner, Maria Cristina Primo, said they were about to hail a jeepney when she heard the shot. Before fleeing, the gunman fired a second shot at Monteroyo who was already slumped on the pavement, she said.
Caramat said a bullet went through the victim’s head from the left temple. The victim also sustained a gunshot wound in the back.
Monteroyo was arrested for illegal possession of firearm and possession of illegal drugs on July 23 by members of the Makati City Police Community Precinct 9.
The investigation report of PO3 Voltaire Esguerra stated that the police were patrolling Barangay Pembo when they saw four men in a dark portion of Escuela Street.
Two men fired at the approaching patrol car before running away. A shootout ensued as the policemen stepped out of the car and chased the suspects.
The suspects entered a house on Sampaguita Street where policemen found Monteroyo with a gunshot wound in the right knee and holding a .38-cal. revolver loaded with six bullets.
When Monteroyo was frisked, police found two sachets of suspected shabu (methampethamine hydrochloride). He was brought to Ospital ng Makati for treatment.
Senior Insp. Anthony Bagsik, team leader of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group, said Monteroyo was included in the watchlist as drug pusher and a hold-up man.
Monteroyo, who was out on bail, had just attended a hearing on the illegal possession of firearm case when he was shot.  SFM

Police recovered 11 empty shells of a .55-pistol and two deformed slugs.
Based on police investigation, Molina, a resident of Hilltop, Casili, Consolacion, was standing outside a barbeque stand when he was shot several times by three unidentified persons on board a motorcycle. 
A girl, who was standing near the place, was hit by a ricocheting bullet.
Molina earlier admitted that he peddled illegal drugs before he voluntarily surrendered to the police during the implementation of the Oplan Tokhang. Tokhang is a program of the Philippine National Police wherein policemen visit the homes of suspected drug users and pushers and encourage them to cooperate with the government and undergo rehabilitation.
Chief Supt. Noli Taliño, director of the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7), said police investigation of the shooting was still in progress as of Tuesday.
“Our investigators are looking into the case,” he said in a brief text message to the Cebu Daily News.
From July 1 to Aug. 31, eighty-nine suspected drug pushers were killed in police operations in Central Visayas, while 99 others were gunned down by still unidentified assailants.

In another series of tweets on his personal Twitter account, Leonen on Monday maintained that his tweets the other day should not have been taken as political commentary from a member of the Supreme Court.

“The Constitution is not political commentary. It is, after all, the Constitution,” he added.
In response to user @highway54, the justice said: “legal provisions are normative statements capable of inclusion in a broad set of relevant narratives.” 
He added: “I quoted law. Law is law… Laws are legible. They are not, in the words of a critical follower, ‘crypted.’”
“Neither should it be faulted for being ‘bias,’” he said.
On Sunday, the normally reticent justice broke the so-called “dignified silence” maintained by Supreme Court magistrates when he took to social media and made known his sentiments on the bloody war on drugs and on the threat to show a supposed sex video of Sen. Leila de Lima in the House of Representatives.
On the government war on drugs which has counted over 3,000 killed since President Duterte took office on June 30, Leonen cited Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution: “no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.”
On the threat of Mr. Duterte’s allies in Congress to air De Lima’s supposed sex tape, he tweeted out Republic Act No. 9995, the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009.

He also quoted from Article II, Section 11 of the Constitution which affirms that the state shall value the “dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights.”
Leonen’s tweets generated mixed reactions from netizens, some of whom criticized him for airing his views in the public sphere.
Others, on the other hand, thanked him for “reminding” the people of the constitutional guarantees of basic freedoms.
“On point! His post is not directed to anyone or any person. It’s just that these people ‘assuming’ or guilty,” said @heyronfol.

In the morning of Aug. 23, 2010, as then President Benigno Aquino III began his 55th day in office, a dismissed Manila policeman in uniform took control of a tourist bus filled with visitors from Hong Kong.  Holding the terrified passengers at gunpoint at a parking bay in Luneta Park, Rolando Mendoza claimed he had been a victim of injustice. Through notes scribbled on cardboard, he demanded immediate reinstatement to his former position.
The Luneta incident was badly mishandled. It ended gruesomely, and quickly became an emblem of government incompetence and indecisiveness. It defined Aquino’s first 100 days as president.
ADVERTISEMENT







To recall this unfortunate tragedy is to grasp the full measure of President Duterte’s first 100 days in office. It is a record that, in an uncanny way, is also soaked in blood. But, the blood belongs to suspected drug users and traffickers, not to innocent tourists.  There is no doubt how Mr. Duterte would have dealt with the Luneta hostage-taker. He would have killed him himself.
In his inaugural speech, Mr. Duterte said that at the root of the country’s problem with drugs, criminality, and corruption was a more serious condition. He described it as “the erosion of the people’s trust in our country’s leaders; the erosion of the faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people’s lives better, safer and healthier.”FEATURED STORIES

Verging on the illegal
Acknowledging that his methods are often seen as “unorthodox” and “verg[ing] on the illegal,” he asked that his presidency be allowed “a level of governance that is consistent to our mandate.” He said that “the fight will be relentless and it will be sustained.” 
Indeed, more than anything else that has been done under this administration, it is the wanton killings in the war on drugs that the public easily associates with the first 100 days of the Duterte presidency. During this brief period, the police have chalked up 1,375 killings resulting from what they call “legitimate police operations.”  More than 2,000 other murders, mostly from poor communities, have been ascribed to vigilante-style killers.
But, there is another view. In a special report published the other day, the British newspaper The Guardian recounts its interview with an unnamed police officer who talks of the existence of 10 parallel police teams consisting of 16 members each that have been secretly carrying out vigilante-style killings. The report may be accessed here: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings.
The head of the Philippine National Police claims that, as a result of ‘Oplan Tokhang,’ more than 665,518 confessed drug addicts and 53,311 pushers have turned themselves in for rehabilitation. These are astonishing numbers. At no other time have so many ordinary people voluntarily come forward to seek help for their drug addiction. These numbers compel any government to respond with a comprehensive strategy that confronts the menace of drugs as a public health issue.
When Mr. Duterte began his campaign for the presidency, warning about the drug problem and offering himself as the nation’s last hope to end it, people were mesmerized by his tough language. But one wonders if his audiences took his urgent depiction of the drug problem seriously. What made him an overnight political sensation was his powerful presence on the stage, his irreverence, and his insult-driven way of talking. To them, he was the antithesis of the nation’s phlegmatic political elite.  He could have espoused any cause, and it would not have made any difference to them.
Consistent with the image he projects as the personification of a strong state, Mr. Duterte quickly found another area in which he could articulate his message of recuperation of the nation’s will and pride: foreign policy.  “We are no longer anyone’s lackey,” he tells his audiences.  Over the last three months he has directed his harshest tirades against US President Barack Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the European Union, and various human rights groups that have called him out on the abuses being committed by his war on drugs.

In these speeches, he has called for the withdrawal of the remaining US special forces in Mindanao, the termination of Philippine participation in joint US naval patrols of the South China Sea, the suspension of US-PH joint military exercises, and a review of all mutual defense agreements with its most important treaty ally, the United States. While heaping scorn on the country’s old friends, he has signaled his own personal pivot to China and Russia.
Top defense and foreign affairs officials say that none of these statements have ripened into policy.  Evidently, none of these have been the subject of deliberation in Cabinet meetings. This appears to be the hallmark of Dutertismo: an unrestrained chief executive pronounces himself on a wide range of sensitive issues prior to any careful study by the concerned institutions of government.
Totally overshadowed by their principal, members of the Duterte Cabinet quietly plod on—building upon the work done by the previous administration and desperately looking for enduring solutions to recalcitrant problems. They are the same problems: mass poverty, unemployment and underemployment, lack of housing for the poor, inadequate health services, Metro Manila traffic, congested airport runways, unreliable mass transport system, unreleased vehicle plate numbers, etc.
Fear of a President
But, what Dutertismo has sown in the last 100 days is fear—fear of being killed, fear of a President who does not hesitate to name and shame, or publicly threaten anyone.  Fear may whip the bureaucracy into line, curb corruption in the short term, and reduce crime.  But, on the negative side, fear induces people to withhold feedback, and feedback is what any system needs to improve itself.
Mr. Duterte came to power with the promise to quickly relieve the nation of its urgent problems.  His preferred methods ignore the complexity of these pains. Rather than fix troubles, they give rise to bigger problems. Ironically, addicts turn to shabu for the same reason—to escape a difficult life they cannot comprehend.

The QCPD director, Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, confirmed that Kanahashi was one of the people they were looking for in connection with Moynihan’s death. She was found dead on Temple Drive corner Giraffe Street in Barangay Ugong Norte, Quezon City, on Sept. 10.
Footage taken by a closed-circuit television camera near the area showed her alighting from a dark gray sport utility vehicle (SUV) before she was repeatedly shot by someone inside the SUV which then sped off. 
Eleazar added that the relationship betwen Kanahashi and Moynihan were established through the text messages on the cell phone recovered from the latter. Kanahashi was also one of the last persons seen with the victim before she was killed.
Sources claimed that the victim’s family had hinted about his possible involvement in her death.
“We are determining if these links and connection are valid through a ballistic cross matching on the firearm recovered from Kanahashi’s possession,” Eleazar said, adding that a gun of the same caliber used to kill Moynihan was recovered from Kanahashi.
The suspect was reportedly a notorious drug pusher operating in Quezon City and other areas in Metro Manila, supplying shabu and party drugs.
Moynihan, on the other hand, was arrested in 2013 in a drug den in Taguig City.

Try verbal judo, lawmen told","12:37 AM October 14, 2016","“Verbal judo” may serve as an antidote to certain extrajudicial killings that have marred the Duterte administration’s war on drugs.
A police chief on Thursday pushed for  using verbal judo to “disarm” drug suspects police personnel were about to arrest as part of the war on drugs.

“Just by your use of words, you would have overcome the enemy,” Cebu provincial director Senior Supt. Eric Noble said, pitching the use of verbal judo, which he noted was used by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in its operations.
Noble was among police regional directors who testified on details of their police antidrug operations at the last hearing of the joint Senate committees investigating alleged extrajudicial killings amid the bloody war on drugs.FEATURED STORIES

PNP guideline
Sen. Gregorio Honasan II asked how policemen go about arresting drug suspects and enhancing the police guideline of “move, communicate, shoot” so that mistakes would not be committed “at the expense of human lives and this issue of extrajudicial killings would go away.” 
Honasan referred to policemen as “protector[s] of life, liberty and property,” including criminals.
Policemen have to know the use of force, in which they have basic training, according to Noble.
But Noble said policemen should adopt the training of the FBI, which makes use of verbal skills to overcome the enemy. He called this set of skills “verbal judo.”
Like Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa, Noble attended the FBI Academy and specialized in “psychological leadership” and in criminal reactions.
“We should study this verbal use of force. We should study the profiles of people to be arrested so that when we call their attention (during police operations) they would surrender right away,” the Cebu provincial director told Honasan.

Noble said this could render the use of force “unnecessary.”
Disarming with words
Policemen, according to the Cebu police chief, could use the suspect’s language and choose certain words that would coax him to surrender.
“So the suspect will be disarmed by using words,” Noble said.
He expressed hope that this kind of training would be used at the PNP Academy and regional training centers.
In Cebu province, Noble said drug suspects tended to shoot at arresting policemen right away. He said the police had seized 97 firearms, eight of which were high-powered, like M14 rifles.
So far 53 have been killed in police operations against drug suspects in the province, according to Noble.
The Cebu police are investigating the death of 52 other drug suspects, who, he said, were killed by unknown assailants.
Sen. Leila de Lima lauded Noble for his statements, saying there are other ways to neutralize suspects.
“Because killing should be the last resort. I think that’s understood by everyone,” De Lima said.

The sender, who did not give his name, claimed involvement in killings reported in nearby Bongabong town and asked the 51-year-old Luz, regional head of the Citizens Crime Watch (CCW), for help in protecting his wife and child.

Richard Albert, Luz’s live-in partner, warned her not to leave, but the woman set out past 11 p.m. on Sunday and waited for the message sender outside their house, which also served as the CCW office, in Barangay Maligaya in Gloria town.
Albert was away at the time and Luz was left with her two children and CCW staff member Mylin Licop in the house.FEATURED STORIES

“It was a decoy,” said Albert, 54, who added that his partner was unaware of the ploy.
“Knowing Zeny, she was strong outside but very soft inside,” he said, and so she went to answer the call for help. 
A motorcycle drove by and one of its riders shot Luz. The gunmen also shot her phone that fell on the ground.
Senior Supt. Christopher Birung, Oriental Mindoro police director, said several witnesses alerted the Gloria police about the killing, prompting a chase.
Pursuing policemen cornered the gunmen in Barangay Quinabigan in Pinamalayan town, about 3 kilometers away, triggering a shootout in which the  suspected assassins were wounded.
‘Tropa, tropa’
“When they fell to the ground, they began screaming, ‘Tropa, tropa (troops, troops),’” Birung said.

It turned out that the gunmen were ranking police officers—Senior Insp. Magdaleno Pimentel Jr. and Insp. Markson Almeranez.
Pimentel was relieved of his position at the Oriental Mindoro Police Public Safety Company, while Almeranez was removed as police chief of Socorro town following the attack.
Last month, Almeranez was honored as an outstanding police commissioned officer by no less than Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa during a ceremony in Calapan.
Investigation showed Pimentel, who wore a ski mask, drove the motorcycle, while Almeranez disguised himself by wearing a wig.
“Of course, the responding policemen were shocked when they realized they had shot the officers,” Birung said.
He said the involvement of the two officers, both graduates of the Philippine National Police Academy, puzzled investigators.
Murder case
The PNP on Wednesday filed a murder case against them over Luz’s death and multiple attempted murder related to the gunfight with responding policemen.
Pimentel and Almeranez, who were hit in the stomach, are recuperating in a hospital and have yet to issue statements, Birung said.
Albert said Luz  “may have angered many but she did not have any enemy.” He believed the murder was related to her work. The two also ran a small homecare products business.


As an official of CCW, Luz was working on a livelihood program for former drug users and pushers who had surrendered to authorities in response to President Duterte’s call to surrender or die in his no-nonsense war on illegal drugs. —WITH A REPORT FROM JEROME ANING IN MANILA

Of incidents, 1,298, all resulting in deaths, happened between July and September. Of the cases, 300 are resolved (policemen followed procedure) and 28 are for summary hearing (probable cause to charge for violation of PNP procedure). No murder cases filed against policemen.
Manila Police District director, Supt. Joel Coronel: From July 1 to Oct. 5,  200 drug suspects “neutralized” in police operations and 54 deaths under inquiry (DUI).  No MPD personnel involved in salvaging. Of DUI cases, nine cleared with seven suspects identified. Of suspects, four were killed in course of arrest.

Coronel says there are three motives for DUIs: nonremittance of collected drug money; turf war between rival drug syndicates; and possibility of policemen previously involved in drugs killing own sources. Of the latter, two are in active service while the rest are former policemen. There are 12-14 cases of DUIs in a month on average.

Coronel cites PDEA report saying Baseco in Tondo and Sampaloc are most drug-affected areas in Manila. He explains most of distribution network comes from these areas.
Drop by 49 percent in crimes vs property and even crimes vs persons since campaign started three months ago. Core of MPD campaign is supply reduction which resulted in arrest of 1,695 drug users and pushers. On average, 25 to 35 arrests everyday. Coronel says 92 percent of Manila is affected by the use of illegal drugs. Although a few barangays have been cleared, around 120 barangays. 
Sen. Panfilo Lacson asks why there are fewer firearms seized than slain drug personalities; Coronel explains there are those armed with blades.
Lacson asks PDEA to make an analysis and submit to committee why, if there is scarce supply of and low demand for narcotics, prices are still high, P1,300 to P25,000 per gram of “shabu.”
PDEA Director General Isidro Lapeña says PDEA has redefined drug affectation in barangays as seriously affected, moderately affected and slightly affected. Seriously affected means there is presence of a clandestine shabu laboratory or marijuana plantation and 20 percent of residents in the  barangay are users; moderately affected when 2 percent of persons are users; and slightly affected when less than 2 percent use narcotics. He says there is an ongoing survey in  42,000 barangays to update data based on new definition.

The two officers had been wounded in a clash with policemen who were chasing them following Luz’s killing. Pimentel and Almenarez are now suspended.

De Luna said the killing of Luz by policemen should not lead to the condemnation of the entire police force.
The public, he said, should look at the “bigger picture” where many other policemen are faithfully doing their job, even risking their own lives.

ORMOC CITY — The killing of Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. will have a chilling effect on the other witnesses against police and government officials charged for allegedly providing protection to the illegal drugs operation run by his son, Roland “Kerwin” Espinosa Jr.
“It can instill fear among them. What is the guarantee that they are still safe?” asked Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido, Albuera municipal police chief.

Espenido was the one who convinced Espinosa to execute an affidavit and identify the government and police officials who provided protection to his son Kerwin’s illegal drug trade, the biggest in Eastern Visayas.
The mayor identified 226 names including 19 politicians, four from the judiciary, 38 policemen, seven from Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), one from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, three from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, one from the Army and three from the media.FEATURED STORIES

Separate complaints were later filed against 47 out of the 226 names at the Office of the Ombudsman, the prosecutors’ office and the Philippine National Police.
These included seven government officials including Sen. Leila de Lima, 33 police officers and seven private individuals. 
Mayor Espinosa was a vital witness to these cases.
In exchange of the affidavit, Espenido assured the mayor of his safety and allowed him to stay in his police station until Oct. 5 when he was transferred to a sub-provincial jail in Baybay City to face charges of illegal possession of firearms and drugs.
Exactly a month after his transfer to the facility, Espinosa was killed in what the Criminal Investigation Group in Eastern Visayas (CIDG-8) claimed was a shootout.
Fifteen members of the CIDG team barged into the facility at 3 a.m. on Nov. 5 to serve a search warrant on Espinosa whom they suspected to be keeping shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) inside his cell.
The CIDG-8 claimed that Espinosa shot them, prompting them to fire at him, hitting the mayor in the head, chest and stomach.

Also killed in the raid was Raul Yap, a native of Albuera who was detained on drug charges.
The raiding team recovered a .38-pistol and a pack of shabu from the cell of Espinosa and a .45-pistol, 27 packs of marijuana and 21 sachets of shabu from Yap.
Before they left, the CIDG reportedly took the hard drive connected to the close circuit television cameras.
Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Philippine National Police chief, who assured Espinosa of his safety, ordered an investigation on the shootout.
A team from Camp Crame arrived on Sunday to start their investigation on the deaths of Espinosa and Yap.

Espenido said he was surprised by the raid conducted by the CIDG on Espinosa who was killed for allegedly possessing a single firearm.
“We have conducted raids (against Espinosa) involving packs of shabu and cache of firearms. We did not harm or kill him. He eventually surrendered. But for a single firearm (he was killed)?” Espenido said.
He told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that he planned to visit the wake of Espinosa in his house in Barangay Tinago, Albuera.
“I will apologize to his family. I really thought that he would be safe if he was detained at the (Leyte sub-provincial jail) but unfortunately, he was killed,” Espenido said.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer tried to reach Supt. Marvin Marcos, CIDG-8 chief, but he declined to grant an interview.


Incidentally, Marcos’ aunt, Lalaine Jimenea, publisher of a local paper in Ormoc was one of those who were linked by Espinosa to Kerwin’s illegal drug operation.
Jimenea, who had denied the charges, was among the seven persons charged at the Regional State Prosecutor’s office in Leyte for allegedly receiving payola from Kerwin.
Aside from Jimenea, the others charged by Espenido after they were linked by Espinosa were Senator De Lima; Vice Mayor Jonah John Ungab of Ronda town in Cebu; businessmen Eufrocino “Winnie” Codilla Jr.; Victor Espina Jr., brother of former Philippine National Police officer-in-charge and retired Director
General Leonardo Espina; and retired Bureau of Jail Management and Penology warden Joseph Nuñez who was warden of the Ormoc City jail when Kerwin was previously detained.
Several policemen were also facing administrative complaints at the Regional Internal Affairs Service (RIAS).
Among them were Supt. Joey Masauding, former CIDG-8 director; Senior Supt. Jose Macanas, former Ormoc police director; and Supt.Ibrahim Jambiran, former intelligence police chief in Ormoc.
Espinosa was the prime witness in all these cases.
According to Albert Hidalgo, former president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines in Leyte, the affidavit executed by Espinosa lost its probative value with his death.
But he added the affidavit could be used to corroborate testimonies of other witnesses.
Hidalgo said the danger of using the affidavit of Espinosa in court was that it would be open to questions by the defense counsels during cross examination.
“The affidavit will just be hearsay (now that Espinosa is dead),” Hidalgo said.


Leilani Villarino, Espinosa’s legal counsel, said the family had not decided whether or not to press charges against the CIDG.
She said they would first wait for the outcome of the investigation before deciding on their next step.  SFM

The bodies terrified Betchie Salvador, because she had always known her husband could be next.
They had begun turning up all over the country ever since President Duterte launched a controversial war on drugs this year—so many that one newspaper, the Inquirer, had to create a “Kill List” just to keep track. Dealers and addicts were being shot by police or unidentified gunmen, who were dumping them on darkened streets beside cardboard signs that warned, “I’m a pusher. Don’t be like me.”

Marcelo, who worked as a driver, had been introduced to a potent methamphetamine known as shabu two years earlier by a colleague who said it helped him stay awake
at night. 
And the nation believed
 
In his campaign for the presidency, Duterte described the drug as a life-or-death threat to a nation. And the nation, exasperated by decades of crime and corruption, believed him.
It didn’t matter that government statistics showed the rate of methamphetamine use had dropped from 6.7 million in 2004 to 1.7 million today. It didn’t matter that this rate—an estimated 2 percent of Filipinos—was no higher than that of other countries like the United States or Australia in recent years. It didn’t matter that drug wars mounted in countries like Thailand or Colombia or America had failed.
 
ADVERTISEMENT
 


What mattered was that this was a cause the nation could rally around.
After Duterte was sworn into office June 30, the antidrug operation—called “Double Barrel”—began. Police drew up “watch lists” of suspected addicts and dealers, and security forces began carrying out raids. Vigilantes also went to work.
Near Marcelo’s home, a couple was found murdered in their rickshaw. Later, another man was found with his neck slashed beside a placard labeling him an addict and a thief.
The children view his remains during the wake at the family residence.
Family’s fears
By then, Marcelo’s family was starting to fear for his life. He made a living driving a tricycle, earning just enough to support their two boys, ages 6 and 7, and a newborn baby girl.  His mother, Betty Soriano, decided to accompany him to keep him safe and discourage him from doing drugs.
Marcelo also promised to quit shabu, saying it had become too dangerous. He told Betchie she didn’t have to worry “because I’m not using drugs anymore.”
At one point, a government official told Marcelo to turn himself in, a process called “surrendering” that has drawn about 700,000 drug users so far. Most are released after acknowledging their crimes and pledging never to use again.
Marcelo waved the man off, saying he had quit.
In the meantime, the number of deaths piled up: At least 1,578 drug suspects were killed by state security forces since Duterte took office, police statistics show. Vigilantes killed even more, with 2,151 murders either linked to the drug trade or classified as “unexplained.”
As a result, crime fell in some areas by nearly half, police say. But in a country that banned the death penalty a decade ago, the huge death toll has left many aghast.


“What I don’t understand is, how can—it boggles my mind—how can you actually propose that to address the problem of injustice, you perpetuate more injustice?” said Jose Luis Martin “Chito” Gascon, director of the independent Commission on Human Rights.
Men in black
On the night of Sept. 5, Marcelo parked his tricycle at a small roadside kiosk, where he had stopped to buy essentials for the morning—coffee for his family, chocolate drinking powder for his kids.
When Malvin Balingatan, who worked at the shop, leaned forward to hand him change, shots rang out, according to the police report.
It was 10:05 p.m.
As Balingatan ducked, he caught a glimpse of two men in black on a motorcycle, helmets covering their faces.
Marcelo managed to run 10 or 15 meters to the corner, where more shots were fired. He collapsed.
His mother screamed out, “My son! My son!”
At their family home, a five-minute walk away, Soriano broke the news to Betchie. Marcelo’s children appeared, woken by the chaos and the crying.
“Where’s Daddy?” one of them asked. “Where’s Daddy?”


“He’s gone,” Betchie replied, tears streaming down her cheeks.
‘What’s the point?’
By the time Betchie got to the scene, Marcelo—her Marcelo—was sprawled face-down in a pool of blood, his body lit by a halo of light from television cameras. A small translucent packet of white methamphetamines was visible beside his fingertips.
Her mother-in-law insists the drugs weren’t there when he died. She doesn’t know who put them there, or why. But she won’t press the issue with police, who say they have no leads.
“We don’t want any trouble,” she says. “What’s the point? What for?”
Betchie says she hopes they find who did this. But there is resignation in her voice. She is looking down toward her lap, eyes half closed.
Three days have passed since the shooting, and she is trying not to cry.
“I keep wondering what will happen to me, to my children,” she says, explaining that Marcelo, 39, was their family’s sole breadwinner. “All we can do now is pray.”
Outside, Marcelo’s tricycle is parked on the curb, empty and quiet. A pair of red and blue wristbands are wrapped around its headlight and speedometer, propaganda from the election campaign.
Each is inscribed with seven white letters: D U T E R T E. —AP

(Photo courtesy of Aksyon Radyo Iloilo)
ILOILO CITY — Two motorcycle-riding gunmen separately shot dead two men linked to crimes in two successive nights in Iloilo City, raising fears of a hit squad targeting crime suspects in this fast-developing but still laid-back city.
While police have not established links between the shootings in Molo District on Tuesday and La Paz District on Wednesday, the killings bore similarities.
Two armed men on board a motorcycle stopped in front of the victims and repeatedly shot their targets in a public place. They told bystanders to stay calm and not interfere as they were after only after the victims.
They left the scene calmly and police have not arrested any of the assailants.FEATURED STORIES

On Tuesday evening, two motorcycle-riding assailants shot dead a known theft and illegal drug suspect in Barangay San Pedro in Molo District.
Joemarie Arroyo, 46, died of several gunshot wounds including in the head and chest after he was repeatedly shot about 9:50 p.m., said Senior Insp. Mark Cordero, Molo District police chief.
Arroyo was drinking at a store along the road when the attack happened.
The passenger of the motorcycle first alighted and shot Arroyo but his gun apparently jammed. The driver then got off the motorcycle and also shot the victim apparently to make sure he was dead.
They told bystanders to remain calm and stay away before they fled.
Arroyo had been tagged in several theft cases in the community and was facing several complaints, including one for stealing donations inside the church and belongings of parishioners in parked cars, said Cordero.
Cordero added that Arroyo was a suspected drug pusher.
On Wednesday evening, two motorcycle-riding assailants also gunned down Wensher Caravana, 20, in Barangay Gustilo in La Paz District.
The assailants stopped along a street corner where Caravana was seated with three others and repeatedly shot the victim. They told the three companions of the victim to lie face down and left.
Caravan, who had nine gunshot wounds, was brought to the Western Visayas State University Medical Center but died there.
The victim was a police asset and believed to be part of a drug group, Senior Insp. Rey Sumagaysay, La Paz police chief, said.
Sumagaysay said Caravana’s killing could be due to an intra-group squabble as the victim allegedly wanted to quit the group. But he said they have also been pursuing other angles.
There have been three killings of suspected drug pushers in 12 days in the
city.
Last Oct. 8, Carcar Hablo died of gunshot wounds after he was shot by motorcycle-riding gunmen in Barangay Desamparados in Jaro district.
Hablo was a brother-in-law of Barangay Captain Noeme Hablo of Desamparados.
Police believe the killing could be business or drug-related.
An Iloilo church leader deplored the killings.
“While we support the campaign against illegal drugs and criminality, killing is against (God’s commandments). If they do not believe in God, we still have the Bill of Rights in our Constitution which guarantees the right to life,” said Monsignor Meliton Oso, executive director of the Jaro Archdiocesan Social Action Center.
While law enforcers might not be involved in the killings, Oso said threatening statements by President Duterte against drug suspects have encouraged the killings.
“He keeps on telling the drugs suspect: ‘I will kill you. I will kill you,’ which can be interpreted by policemen as a go-signal,” Oso said.
From July 1 to October 19, the Philippine National Police reported 35 violent deaths, which have been classified as “deaths under investigation,” excluding the three recent killings.
Of the 35, five are considered drug-related, another five  “suspected” drug-related and 13  undetermined.  SFM/rga

The sight of her parents’ tombs at the Tala Public Cemetery on All Saints’ Day left Linda speechless. For a moment, it brought back painful memories of how the couple, both confessed drug pushers, were murdered in front of her and her other siblings.
“I want to forget. I pray to my mother to help me forget. I always tell her: ‘Mama, please help me forget’,” the 11-year-old girl, the eldest in a brood of six, told the Inquirer in a recent interview.

On Aug. 25, armed men wearing ski masks burst into their house in Caloocan City. She and her mother, Lilia, woke up to find guns pointed at them. Lilia started pleading for their lives while waving a document proving that she and her husband, Albert, had surrendered under Oplan Tokhang.
Albert was fast asleep with Levy, his 4-year-old son, lying on his chest. Awakened by his wife’s pleas, he sat up but a bullet split his head open. Next was his wife who was also shot in the head. The armed men then left.FEATURED STORIES

Before they were killed, the couple had been planning to return to the province where they planned to start life afresh.
“I’m still having a hard time sleeping at night. I always dream about my parents and my older sister who died from rabies. In my dreams, we are happy. It’s always like that,” Linda said. “Those dreams make me miss them so much.” 
All Saints’ Day turned into a reunion of sorts for her and her five other siblings who have been living separately since the killings.
Linda has been staying with her grandmother, Fely, in another city, because suspicious-looking men on motorcycles were still roaming around their old neighborhood in Tala, Caloocan City.
Lester, her 8-year-old brother and younger sister Lulu, 5, are also in Fely’s care.
When Linda returned to Tala on Nov. 1, she ran straight into the alley leading to her aunt Mary’s house. This was where her younger brothers Levy, 4 and Lance, 2 had been staying for the past months.
She embraced the boys and placed them on her lap. She sang songs to them and kissed them repeatedly. Her 10-year-old sister Laura, who had been adopted by another relative, also came and played with them.

With the arrival of Lester and Lulu, the siblings were complete. They were clearly happy to be together as they sang, danced, rolled around the floor and embraced each other. Talk turned to who attended the most fun Halloween party.
“You should have been here. We really had fun,” Lester told Lulu. “But I had fun, too. Don’t you know, I won in a dance contest. I was the star,” she replied.
The reunion, however, was briefly halted because Fely and her three daughters wanted to leave for the cemetery. They wanted to bring all the younger children with them but Mary prevailed on them to leave Levy and Lance behind.
On their way to visit their parents, Linda took this reporter’s hand, telling her, “Please be careful, it’s really muddy here. You might slip so hold my hand.” She did not let go until it was time to leave.
In front of Albert and Lilia’s tombs, Fely and her daughters recited a novena as the couple’s four children looked on. They later urged the kids: “You can’t see them but they can see you. Talk to mama and papa. Pray for them.”
Linda then bowed her head and started to cry quietly. Before long, she was wailing, “Mama, mama, mama.”
According to Mary, they had no choice but raise the couple’s six children separately “since we are not rich.” Besides, all of them have their own children to look after, she told the Inquirer.
“Just thinking of where to get money to feed the kids makes my head spin. We’re not wealthy and we don’t have stable jobs. Every day, we try to just get by,” Mary said.
On their way to their grandfather’s tomb which was just nearby, the children started singing a song about the rain, love and loss.
As they were belting out the lyrics, Linda was smiling, happy and contented in the company of her siblings.

Today, she lives with her three children in hiding, sheltered by an extraordinary witness protection program run by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), which has feared for her safety while it investigates the case.
That such a program exists is powerful indictment of the lack of trust many have in the country’s notoriously corrupt police, who are spearheading an antidrug campaign that has left more than 4,000 people dead in just a few months. 
It also illustrates the failures of a broken justice system.
Kazuo said she was pushing the case because “what is happening is not right.”
“I want them to feel how they treated my husband,” she said. “I want them to feel what it’s like for a family to lose a loved one.”
Although both police officers have been suspended and have attended preliminary hearings, City Prosecutor Orlando Mariano said the two remained free and neither had been indicted.
If prosecutors determine the evidence is too weak, both men could end up being absolved.

CHR Chair Jose Luis Martin Gascon said no policeman had been charged criminally in court since the drug war began despite persistent reports of security forces summarily executing drug suspects.
Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlo, the Philippine National Police spokesperson, however, said some officers had been arrested and charged, but he could offer no details.
President Duterte unleashed his campaign to rid the country of narcotics immediately after taking office on June 30.
The effort has been praised by a population exasperated by corruption and crime, but it has been condemned by the United Nations, foreign governments and activist groups because of its staggering death toll and apparent disregard for human life.
Kazuo acknowledged that her husband was a small-time methamphetamine dealer.
But she insisted that he only pushed the drug because he could find no other work.
Just before midnight on July 6, police raided their tiny one-room apartment in a slum in Pasay City.
The officers could not find any drugs, but they hauled 28-year-old Jaypee Bertes away anyway, along with his father, 49-year-old Renato.
When Kazuo visited them at a police station the next morning, both men were severely bruised.
Hours later—after she left—they were shot dead at the end of a narrow corridor, each three times.


Police said the men were killed after one of them attempted to grab a firearm belonging to the officers.
But CHR officials, who conducted their own forensics investigation, said the detainees had been beaten so badly that they could not have done so.
One of Bertes’ arms, they said, had been broken.
It wasn’t the first time a drug suspect was fatally shot in police detention.
Last week, a town mayor detained for illegal drugs and gun possession was killed by officers in a purported gun battle in his jail cell in Leyte province.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a former Philippine National Police chief, called for an investigation and suspects the mayor, Rolando Espinosa Sr., was killed to prevent him from implicating other officials in illegal drugs.
Gascon said the officers in Kazuo’s case may have killed her husband to cover any links that could connect them to drug crimes.
Kazuo said Bertes had met the two officers she accused at least once before, when he bribed them to get out of a previous drug charge.
Silence for good reason
The families of most victims in the drug war have stayed silent for good reason.


Media reported the story of one man who had doggedly pursued justice for months for his sister, who had been killed by unidentified gunmen in Manila.
The man, who was not under CHR protection, turned up dead in late October.
“I rarely go outside anymore,” Kazuo said. “I stay inside the house, sometimes I read books, love stories … I don’t even want to go outside and walk.”
Kazuo, who has a 2-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, gave birth to a boy in September. During a visit for a prenatal checkup, someone recognized her, prompting CHR officials to switch hospitals.
The CHR is now protecting at least seven other witnesses in similar circumstances.
Its investigators are combing over 250 cases, many involving allegations that police carried out extrajudicial killings or other abuses.
They’ve received little cooperation from the PNP. An investigator assigned to Kazuo’s case said police had refused to release their autopsy report, so the commission conducted its own.
“It’ll get worse before it gets better,” Gascon said. “While [Mr.] Duterte is president, I do not believe people will be charged and held to account … so what we need to do now is to prepare the evidence for the time we can have a proper reckoning.” —AP

Priority
The move to restore the death penalty is one of the priority legislative agenda of President Duterte’s allies in the House of Representatives.  Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said in a recent interview in Japan he hoped to see the measure pass by December. 
At Wednesday’s hearing, Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption founding chair Dante Jimenez expressed his backing for capital punishment.
He said that the argument was not a deterrent to crime was misleading. “The crime deterrence factor of the death penalty is clear in history,” he said, citing a decline in drug trafficking when a drug lord was executed during Martial Law.
“Since the dawn of civilization the death penalty in varying modes of execution and for different crimes including pickpocketing in England was an additional punishment for crimes. Is this true?” he asked.
To which Jimenez replied: “I don’t have an idea honestly… I was born in 1952.”
Irked by Jimenez’ sarcasm, Lagman said: “I will not further question this witness with this kind of answer,” prompting the presiding chair to ask the VACC leader to answer questions courteously.

Jimenez then apologized, saying he was just being honest and meant no offense.

While most Filipinos spent All Saints’ Day visiting their departed loved ones in cemeteries, the families of a young couple slain by unidentified gunmen continue to grieve over their bodies in their own homes, unable to raise the money needed for a decent burial.
Around 11 p.m. on Oct. 25, two armed men on a motorcycle shot dead Jerico Camitan, 21 and his live-in partner Erica Fernandez, 17, on Gumamela Street in Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City. A placard found on top of Camitan’s body read: “Tulak ka, hayop ka (You are a drug pusher, you animal).”

But no sachets of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) or drug paraphernalia were found at the scene. Only his cell phone, cash amounting to less than P400 and a watch were retrieved from Jerico who works as a construction worker. From Erica, a Grade 8 student, the police recovered a bloodstained Barbie doll along with a Hello Kitty wristwatch and a blue wallet.
In a recent interview with the Inquirer, the families of Jerico and Erica denied the pair’s involvement in illegal drugs. This was backed up by the police who told them that the couple had tested negative for drugs and were not on any drug watch list. Although vindicated by the findings, adding to the families’ pain is the more difficult question of where they would get the money needed for funeral and burial services.FEATURED STORIES

Rommel, Jerico’s father, told the Inquirer that it would cost over P60,000 to bury his youngest son. According to him, Light Funeral Services was charging him P46,000 for the autopsy and P12,000 for other services. On top of these, he needs to pay P5,000 for a niche at the Bagbag Public Cemetery.
“We are already very poor and they still make it so hard for us,” Rommel said, adding, “I just don’t understand.” On Nov. 3, he informed the Inquirer that the P60,000 had been lowered to P35,000, burial expenses included. 
A widower, Rommel is a construction worker in San Mateo, Rizal province earning around P600 per day. He has not been to work since his son’s death as he has been busy attending to his son’s wake which is being held in a narrow alley next to their rented house.
Rommel stays up late every night to collect contributions from neighbors playing cards at his son’s wake. On the eve of All Saints’ Day, he managed to collect P1,000, a small fraction of what he needs to raise.
“Others have told me not to get my son’s body from the morgue anymore because of the expenses,” Rommel said. “But he is my son, my poor son.”
Erica’s family is in the same situation. In their small shanty, her coffin is adorned by her favorite stuffed toy, a violet teddy bear from Jerico, said her elder sister Janet. Their neighbors have lent them a florescent bulb for Erica’s wake since there is no power in their house.
With both of her parents jobless, Erika’s relatives are at a loss on where to get the money to bury her. The funeral home is charging them P71,000 but this was later lowered to P58,000.

“We were told by Light Funeral Services to wait until Nov. 9 so we can get burial assistance from the Office of the Vice Mayor,” said Janet, who noted that the city government gives as much as P25,000. “But it is still not enough and we don’t know where we will get the rest of the money,” she added.
“If they really were drug pushers, we should be rich by now. But we don’t even have money to buy rice,” Janet told the Inquirer.
Both families said the police was looking at the third party angle. Erica reportedly broke up with Jerico a few weeks earlier and was seeing someone else.
Autopsy reports showed that Jerico was shot five times while Erica sustained a gunshot wound in the neck.
Rommel said while the Duterte administration’s war on drugs had good intentions, “not everyone who gets killed is actually a drug user. My son was an unintended casualty.”
When they finally raise enough money, the couple’s parents plan to lay them to rest beside each other.
“They were together for 3 years and they were both good kids,” Janet said.
“The funeral home told me his body can keep for only two weeks, and I have to bury Jerico next week,” Rommel said. “I don’t know what I will do with my son’s body if I don’t raise the money for his burial. I don’t even want to think about it.”

As of Nov. 15, the EPD has recorded 9,375 surrenderers from the four cities, of whom 244 were listed as drug pushers while the rest were counted as drug users, according to Senior Supt. Edwin de Ocampo, the EPD deputy chief for operations.
Pasig has the highest number of surrenderers with 4,019; Mandaluyong is second with 2,438; Marikina has 2023, while San Juan has 895.
Since July, 979 suspects —those who did not surrender under Tokhang but were on the drug watch list prepared by their barangays—have been arrested; 41 were killed in police operations; 14 were found dead in the streets, while 139 were killed by unidentified gunmen.
At least 1,822 drug users are currently undergoing rehabilitation, De Ocampo added.

On the seventh anniversary of the Maguindanao massacre, Kabayan Rep. Harry Roque filed House Bill No. 4502, which would  declare Nov. 23 “A National Day of Commemoration for all Victims of Extralegal Killings.”

Fifty-eight people, 32 of them journalists, were killed by soldiers, policemen and militiamen allegedly led by Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. in Ampatuan town, Maguindanao province, on Nov. 23, 2009.
Roque’s bill described the massacre as the “worst single attack on press freedom in recorded history and the worst spate of election-related violence in the Philippines since the martial law era.”FEATURED STORIES

Drug war victims
“This will also include the more than 3,000 who have been killed in the drug war,” Roque told a news conference in the House. 
More than 4,000 people, mostly small-time users and pushers, have been killed by police and unknown assailants since Mr. Duterte took office on June 30.
There is a need to “pass a law that would set aside a day to commemorate victims of extralegal killings, including the victims of the [Maguindanao] massacre, to stress [the government’s] resolve to fight impunity and to honor the memory of those who perished by rejecting impunity as a state policy,” Roque said in the introduction of his bill.
The wives and mothers of the massacre victims, all of whom lamented the slow progress of the case in court, attended Roque’s news conference.
“The [Maguindanao] massacre shows that our criminal justice system is not working. This is not peculiar to one administration. The Ampatuans are allies of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Former President Aquino promised justice and Leila de Lima used the Maguindanao massacre to advance her cause for human rights but nothing happened,” Roque said.
He said the families of the victims hoped to find justice during the term of President Duterte.

“All we need is one conviction to send them all to Muntinlupa,” Roque said, referring to New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City. He remains the families’ lawyer.
Roque appealed to Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 221 to resolve the case before she moves to the Court of Appeals.
There are rumors that Reyes has been promoted to appellate justice.
“She deserves to be promoted but the consideration that we need is justice. The case will need closure and a new judge would cause tremendous delay to the case,” Roque said.
Students hold protests
Journalism students of University of San Agustin in Iloilo City lit candles near the main gate of the school on Wednesday to mark the seventh anniversary of the massacre.
Journalists joined the commemoration, lamenting the slow trial of the killers.
“Failure to bring justice to slain and harassed journalists is one of the worst, if not the worst, kind of tragedy and irony a democracy like the Philippines can suffer,” said Francis Ablan Angelo, president of the Iloilo provincial capitol press corps. —WITH A REPORT FROM NESTOR P. BURGOS JR.

Baylon said the ringing of bells and offering of prayers would continue for as long as necessary.
“We are in full support of your desire to eradicate this drug problem,” he told President Duterte in his letter, but he lamented the loss of 4,000 lives in the violence that had accompanied his campaign. 
“It saddens us to see that the majority of the victims are the very same poor whose lives you promised to protect and alleviate from the shackles of abject poverty,” he said.
He said the diocese had started “Harong Paglaom” (House of Hope), a community-based rehabilitation program aimed at providing recovery coaching, spiritual guidance and life skills training to substance users, in collaboration with local government units, particularly the barangays.
Speaking before judges, lawyers and fellow graduates from the San Beda College of Law on Saturday night, Mr. Duterte said:
“In the coming days, I will make it a must, that all of you who are into illegal drugs should not step out of your house … I don’t have (enough) jails. You just stay in your home and lock yourself up. If you go outside, son of a bitch, I will kill you if I see you outside.”
The President’s warning came amid the planned visit to the country of the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions Agnes Callamard, who was invited by Malacañang to “see for herself” the conduct of the Duterte administration’s ruthless drug war.

Despite repeatedly issuing such threats, Mr. Duterte had vehemently denied ordering the execution of drug suspects and blamed the criminal syndicates of purging their own ranks.
He had locked horns with officials of the United States, European Union and the United Nations for such remarks, which his critics believed were a veiled sanction for the police to engage in extrajudicial killings.
The foul-mouthed former Davao City mayor had earned the adulation of his supporters by promising to eradicate the drug problem and criminality in the country within the first six months of his administration, a vow he had failed to keep as he asked for a six-month extension in carrying out his drug campaign.
Surveys show up to 80 percent of Filipinos support his antinarcotics campaign.
As in previous gatherings, the President spent much of his 50-minute speech giving litany regarding his administration’s campaign against illegal drugs and how difficult the task was.
“I will suppress drugs. I’m doing it and believe me, until the last pusher (is) out of the streets and (the) last drug lord is exterminated, it will last until the last day of my term. I will not back down,” he said.
“While I don’t want to sound conceited, if I did not become President, the truth about our problem with illegal drugs, which is really a virulent issue and activity, will not come out,” he added.
The drug problem, Mr. Duterte said, was much more difficult to handle than terrorism. “I would rather deal with terrorism because… it’s just violence for a moment,” he said.
The President said the validated list of policemen, mayors and other government officials involved in the illegal drug trade was about several inches thick.
Mr. Duterte had earlier identified former President Fidel Ramos, who also attended the event, as the source of his so-called “narcolist.”


He said the information given to him by Ramos, whom he described as his “No. 1 critic and No. 1 supporter,” prompted him to seek the presidency.
According to the President, he would present the list of public officials behind the narcotics business in the next meeting of the National Security Council.

Concerns over the increasing number of unsolved drug-related killings were raised on Thursday during a meeting between Metro Manila mayors and Interior Secretary Mike Sueno.
Pateros Mayor Miguel “Ike” Ponce III observed during the Metro Manila Council meeting that since July, 37 drug suspects have been killed by the “bonnet gang” in his municipality without any of the perpetrators being arrested.

According to him, this has discouraged those who earlier surrendered under “Oplan Tokhang” as shown by the drop in the weekly Zumba attendance from around 300 to barely 10. Surrenderers are required to attend the Zumba sessions as part of their rehabilitation.
“This is a reality that I want to bring up with Secretary Sueno and especially addressed to our police force. There are no more [drug] surrenderers; they no longer want to participate in rehabilitation programs because they are afraid,” Ponce said.FEATURED STORIES

He added that most of his constituents believed that policemen were behind the killings. “If these are carried out by vigilantes, we should arrest them. At the end of the day, we remain answerable to our constituents and they are looking for answers [to] why the killings continue.”
Mandaluyong City Mayor Carmelita Abalos agreed with Ponce, citing a case in which tandem-riding assailants shot someone near a police car but the lawmen did not go after the criminals. 
“How can we bring back the trust of surrenderers? They are willing to change but they need protection,” Abalos said.
The Metro mayors then decided to hold a closed-door session to freely discuss the issue with Sueno. Originally, the meeting was called to discuss solid waste and traffic management measures.
Sueno afterward told reporters that he would bring up the mayors’ concerns over drug-related killings with Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa.
However, he downplayed the issue, saying that Tokhang surrenderers who were subsequently killed were isolated cases. “It’s not a problem in all cities, just two or three, and we are trying to solve it,” he said.
Manila City administrator Ericson Alcovendaz, who represented Mayor Joseph Estrada, said he agreed with other mayors that the vigilante-style killings were diminishing the credibility of the government’s war against drugs.

“That’s the directive of Mayor Erap. We should put an end to the drug menace but not resort to shortcuts,” Alcovendaz told reporters.
Based on the Inquirer’s “Kill List,” a total of 1,639 people have died in the government’s ongoing war on drugs as of 12 p.m., Nov. 22. The figure includes those killed in legitimate police operations as well as those targeted by suspected vigilantes.

Gingging Anlagan, 29, from Agusan del Norte, told of how her family of three children had to flee their home three times last year because of military and mining operations.
“(The relocations) disrupt the education and cultural growth of our children,” she said. 
In an emotional speech, indigenous leader and antimining activist Erita Capion Dialang said mining company Xstrata-SMI didn’t care about the welfare of the tribal people.
Dialang is the sister Daguil Capion, who had declared a pangayaw (tribal war) against the mining company and whose pregnant wife Juvy and two children were killed in October reportedly by soldiers.
“We are here because Manila needs to listen to the marginalized peoples of Mindanao,”
said Dulphing Ogan, secretary general of Kalumaran, an alliance of indigenous tribes that headed the Manilakbayan together with Panalipdan Mindanao.
“It is ironic that Mindanao is considered the food basket, the wellspring of many natural, mineral and aquatic resources, but it is also the most neglected in terms of services, as these resources are plundered by foreign multinational corporations in cahoots with the government,” Ogan said.

People’s organizations and human rights groups met up with the delegates Monday in a salubong at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila, which was followed by a Mass at Quiapo Church, tribal dances, the beating of a gong to symbolize unity, the Banwaon ritual and a solidarity boodle lunch.
The salubong opened a series of activities that will culminate in a protest rally at Mendiola
near Malacañang to mark International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10.
Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Teodoro Casiño said he hoped President Aquino would not dismiss the Manilakbayan as “mere propaganda like he did in New Zealand a few weeks back.”
Casiño said that of the 32 documented extrajudicial killings in Mindanao since 2010, 24 were of Lumad leaders who were against mining.
“The lives of Mindanaoans are being treated as mere collateral damage for gold, plantations, mega dams, coal-fired plants and other extractive industries which the Aquino administration itself is sponsoring,” he said.

Italian priest Fausto “Fr. Pops” Tentorio was killed allegedly for his strong objection to a proposed hydropower project in the Arakan part of Pulangui River, a military officer said Thursday.
Colonel Leopoldo Galon, spokesperson of the Eastern Mindanao Command based in Davao City, said this was the initial confession of the suspect who was arrested yesterday for the murder of Tentorio in October.

“Alleged masterminds are wealthy landowners in Arakan who stand to profit from the hydropower project, which Fr. Pops alongside his ‘lumad’ organizations and other left-leaning groups are actively opposing,” Galon said in a text message.
Fr. Sebastiano D’Ambra, who belongs to the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (Pime), said he would reserve his comments on the arrest of the supposed suspect.FEATURED STORIES

He doubted claims that Ato had been identified by witnesses as the one who shot and killed Tentorio, a member of Pime.
“As far as I know there was no clear witness to the crime. Unlike Tulio (Favali) who was killed in front of many witnesses, Tentorio was killed with hardly a witness,” D’Ambra, who is based in Zamboanga City, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by text message. 
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents arrested a Jimmy Ato during a police-backed operation in Kulaman Valley village in Arakan, North Cotabato, at around 3 a.m. on Thursday, said Senior Superintendent Cornelio Salinas, North Cotabato police chief.
A military officer privy to the arrest said Ato was captured at around 5 a.m.
The military officer, who requested anonymity for lack of authority to speak on the matter, said the suspect had been brought to Cagayan de Oro City and then flown to Manila on the same day.
Galon said Ato’s brother, identified as Robert, had eluded arrest when NBI agents chanced upon the duo in Iwak-iwak sub-village.
Tentorio was preparing to leave for a clergy meeting in Kidapawan City on the morning of October 17 when attacked by a masked man.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Although Ato was wearing a crash helmet at the time of the shooting, he was seen by witnesses near Tentorio’s parish church before and after the killing, said Virgilio Mendez, chief of the NBI in Region 12.
“In fact, one of our witnesses was able to talk to him before Tentorio was murdered,” Mendez said.
Fr. Peter Geremia, a Pime missionary based in Central Mindanao, thanked authorities for the arrest of the suspected killer of Tentorio.
Identify mastermind
He said it was a positive development in the Tentorio murder case.
“The next great task is to identify who planned and masterminded Tentorio’s killing; and those who tried to cover up the case,” Geremia told the Inquirer by phone.
He said the arrest could shed light on Tentorio’s killing and encourage more witnesses to surface.
Bishop Modesto Villasanta, convenor of the Exodus for Justice and Peace, said Ato’s arrest was a piece of good news.
“Good because we will know the motive of his killing. We hope this will bring us closer to justice for Fr. Pops [Tentorio],” Villasanta said in a text message to the Inquirer.
Brief gun battle


Mendez said Robert fled on foot after engaging the arresting team in a brief gun battle.
“He was able to run away from the area after he shot at us,” Mendez said in a mobile phone interview.
Mendez said Jimmy was arrested based on a standing warrant of arrest issued by a Cotabato RTC in connection with another case for destructive arson with homicide.
He said the NBI would file  a murder case next week against Jimmy and his brother in connection with Tentorio’s killing.
“There had actually been several operations before this. We just wanted an airtight case before filing the case against the suspects,” he said.
Concrete sign
Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the arrest of Ato was a “concrete sign” that the Aquino administration had been making gains in putting an end to the culture of impunity that had abetted extrajudicial killings in the country the past several years.
“It’s gratifying to note that the landscape is now changing,” De Lima said in a text message.
She added: “I believe that this development is yet another concrete sign that we’re starting to break the culture of impunity that has long pervaded our country, thanks to the steadfast, concerted and collaborative actions among relevant law enforcement agencies.”
The justice secretary said investigators were looking at “local politics” behind Tentorio’s murder, but declined to give further details so as not to jeopardize ongoing operations against the suspect’s accomplices, including the mastermind.


“We’re also looking at the victim’s involvement in environment issues as another possible motive (in the killing),” she said.
De Lima said witnesses had pointed to Robert as the driver of the parked motorcycle which the gunman used after the fatal shooting.
Gun for hire
De Lima said the Ato brothers were suspected members of a gun-for-hire syndicate in the area.
“We’re fortunate now because of witnesses’ confidence. I believe… that in most extrajudicial killings, including those in the past, witnesses (were) unwilling to cooperate due to fear of and/or distrust in authorities,” De Lima said.
Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo welcomed the arrest of the alleged gunman but said authorities should not stop in hunting down the mastermind.
“This is not ‘case closed’ until the mastermind is not revealed. We want to know the motive behind the murder. We want to know who’s the mastermind so that we can fight the culture of impunity,” Pabillo, chair of the Episcopal Commission on Social Action, Justice and Peace, told reporters.
Pabillo thanked the NBI for the capture of the suspect. The prelate also said that he had prayed that Tentorio should be the last missionary killed in the Philippines.
“My prayer is for the mastermind to be caught so that all those thinking to commit the same crime would think twice before doing it since the government is serious [in fighting extrajudicial killings] and that government will not allow the mastermind to remain scot-free. I wish this would be the last [killing of a priest],” Pabillo said.
D’Ambra noted that more than two months after the murder, the motive remained unclear, at least to those who loved him. “We don’t know if the killing was related to mining, communist or personal vendetta because sometimes he cannot please everybody,” he said.


Suspected Red backer
The Justice for Pops Movement, which is made up of religious and cause-oriented groups, earlier expressed apprehension about a possible whitewash of the Tentorio murder case.
The group said there were indications that the military was behind Tentorio’s murder, a charge that the Armed Forces of the Philippines had repeatedly denied.
But Galon once said that Tentorio had been a suspected communist supporter.
Priests perceived as defenders of the poor and the oppressed have been tagged as suspected communists, which put their lives in danger, according to Geremia. With reports from Germelina Lacorte and Nico Alconaba, Inquirer Mindanao; and Jerome Aning in Manila

The gunman, who wore a crash helmet, then casually walked to a motorcycle near the church compound and sped away with a companion.

He was first assigned to the Archdiocese of Zamboanga in 1978. He was transferred to the Diocese of Kidapawan in 1980 and assigned as mission administrator to the parish of Columbio in the province of Sultan Kudarat. In 1985, he was transferred to the mission station of Arakan.
Tentorio was the third Italian priest of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (Pime) in the Philippines killed in Mindanao in the last 26 years. 
The first of the three was Tulio Favali, who was killed on April 11, 1985, by cult leader Norberto Manero in Tulunan, North Cotabato.
Manero, two of his brothers and four other accomplices barged into the San Isidro Labrador Parish, shot Favali 22 times and kicked and stomped on his fallen body. Witnesses said the killers also ate bits of the priest’s brain.
Manero was convicted of the killing and spent almost 23 years in prison before his release in 2008.
Seven years after Favali’s death, another Italian Pime priest, Salvatore Carzedda, was killed in an ambush by an unknown assailant in Zamboanga City.
Two Italian Pime missionaries, namely, Luciano Benedetti and Giancarlo Bossi, were abducted in Mindanao in 1998 and 2007, respectively.

Benedetti was kidnapped from a farm near his parish in Sibuco town. He was freed two months later, reportedly after a P7-million ransom was paid.
Bossi was on his way to say a Mass when he was kidnapped by Moro guerrillas. He was released after 39 days.
Another Italian priest, Guiseppe Pierantoni of the Priests of the Sacred Heart, was kidnapped in Dimataling, Zamboanga del Sur, on Oct. 17, 2001, while saying Mass.
At least six other foreign priests from different countries have fallen victim to armed groups in Mindanao since 1993.
Irish priest Desmond Hartford was abducted in Kolambugan, Lanao del Norte, on Oct. 27, 1997, and freed 11 days later. Irish Columban missionary Rufus Halley was shot dead after resisting a kidnap attempt in Malabong, Lanao del Sur, on Aug. 28, 2001.
While on an after-dinner stroll, Irish missionary Michael Sinnott was kidnapped on Oct. 11, 2009, in Pagadian City. He was freed 31 days later.
Spanish priest Bernardo Blanco was driving to his parish in Matarling, Basilan, on March 18, 1993, when gunmen abducted him. He escaped after 48 days in captivity.
American priest Clarence William Bertelsman was abducted by the Abu Sayyaf on July 31, 1994, but rescued after several hours.
Belgian priest Bernard Maes was taken in front of a church in Marawi on Nov. 18, 1997, and freed two days later.  Inquirer Research

Gilbert Paborada, a leader of the Higanonon tribe, was shot by an assassin riding a motorcycle with an accomplice in Barangay Puntod here around 3 p.m. on Wednesday, according to police on Saturday.

Paborada had been based in Opol, Misamis Oriental, but transferred his residence after a series of attacks and death threats that his group has been receiving since last year.
He chairs Pangalasag, a group of indigenous peoples opposing the entry of an American firm planning to develop a palm oil plantation on a land being claimed as ancestral domain by Paborada’s group in the village of Bagocboc in Opol.FEATURED STORIES

Police quoted witnesses as saying Paborada was disembarking from a tricycle near his house in Puntod when he was attacked.
When his bullet-riddled body slumped on the pavement, the gunman fired at him one more time to finish him off. 
Sr. Stella Matutina, of the Missionary of Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing and secretary general of Panalipdan Mindanao, told the Inquirer that Paborada was the latest on the long list of lumad leaders slain since President Aquino came to power in 2010.
She cited the case of a lumad leader belonging to the Banwaon tribe in Barangay Balit in San Luis, Agusan del Sur, who was allegedly tortured before he was murdered, as one example.
“There is this systemic killing of lumad leaders in Mindanao in the name of development,” she said.
“I am very saddened by Paborada’s death,” she said. “This only shows a blatant display of state-sponsored murders against people fighting for their homeland,” she added. Grace Albasin, Inquirer Mindanao

“The three years of the Aquino government mark three years of injustice to my father and to the hundreds more who fell victim to extrajudicial killings under the current administration,” said Baldomero’s son, Ernan, in a statement released to mark the third death anniversary of his father on Friday.

Ernan, vice chair of Hustisya, an organization of families of victims of extra-judicial killings, lamented that no arrests have been made three years after President Aquino announced in his first State of the Nation Address that Baldomero’s case was among those the government was resolving.
“For a government that declared [itself] to be different and better than its predecessor, the outright denial of justice for my father is unacceptable, in the same way that it is unacceptable that the likes of [retired Gen.] Jovito Palparan and [former Palawan Gov.] Joel Reyes are still at large, and that the Ampatuans are allegedly offering money as settlement to the victims,” Ernan said.FEATURED STORIES

Baldomero was shot dead by a lone gunman in front of his rented house in the capital town of Kalibo in Aklan on July 5, 2010. The gunman fled on a motorcycle driven by an accomplice.
Baldomero, 61, who was the provincial chair of the partylist group Bayan Muna and a reelected Lezo town councilor, died from multiple bullet wounds. A Liberal Party member and party mate of the President, Baldomero died just four days after he assumed his second term of office. 
A murder complaint was filed at the Aklan provincial prosecutor’s office on Aug. 3, 2010, against Dindo Ancero and several unidentified persons.
Ancero, 35, a resident of Malingin, Bogo City, Cebu, was identified by witnesses as the lone gunman who shot dead Baldomero, according to investigators.
The prosecutor’s office issued a resolution on Sept. 13, 2010, finding probable cause against the suspects, and filed the information in November 2010. The case was raffled to the Kalibo Regional Trial Court Branch 2.
The court issued a warrant of arrest against Ancero on Jan. 11, 2011, but the case was archived on Oct. 7, 2011, due to the failure to arrest Ancero, according to the records of the Office of the Regional State Prosecutor.
Police Officer 3 Nida Gregas, public information officer of the Aklan Provincial Police Office (Appo), said the task of arresting Ancero was given to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group after the Appo disbanded Task Force Baldomero when it concluded the investigation on the case.

Investigators had not identified the motive in the killing of Baldomero.
But his family believed he was killed because of his activism and past involvement in the rebel movement.
Baldomero was among the youth activists who went underground in Manila shortly after martial law was declared in 1973.
He rose to become one of Panay Island’s top commanders of the New People’s Army until he was arrested in Jaro District in Iloilo City in 1993.
After his release from the Antique Rehabilitation Center following the dismissal of the criminal cases filed against him, Baldomero went home to Lezo to operate a lumber business.
He then joined politics in 1997 when he became a village councilor. He lost when he first ran as town councilor in 2004 but was successful when he ran again in 2007. He was reelected in the May 10, 2010, elections, garnering the third highest number of votes among the councilors.

Pastor Sadrach Sabella of Karapatan said the involvement of “elements of the state” in the deaths of Tony Bago and Arnel Tanduya was confirmed during the two-day fact-finding mission they conducted in the middle of July.

He said Tanduyan was also accused by soldiers of being an NPA supporter before he was killed on May 7.
“The victim had received report that he was one of the targets of the military,” Sabella said. 
Davao del Sur Gov. Claude Bautista, who still has supervision over Davao Occidental, said he has ordered an investigation into the claims of Karapatan as soon as possible.
“But I also want the killing of an alleged military asset by suspected rebels probed,” he said, citing the July 17 killing of Henry Dasal in Barangay Palian in Malita.
Senior Supt. Michael John Dubria, Davao del Sur police chief, said Dasal was brutally murdered — with his face mutilated — and his relatives were supposedly informed by the NPA that rebels were behind his death.
Efren Aksasato, spokesperson of the National Democratic Front-Far South Mindanao, had earlier admitted that the NPA had “arrested” a Henry Dasal, a 50-year-old, resident of Barangay Pinalpalan in Malita on June 15.
“We want justice for all victims regardless of their supposed affiliation. We hope to establish the exact identities of the perpetrators so that we could file charges against them in court,” Bautista told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by phone.

MANILA, Philippines—The husband of a slain human rights activist heaved a sigh of relief, on Wednesday, over the arrest of retired Major Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr., but he vowed to vigilantly pursue justice for those who were killed allegedly by Palparan under the government’s counter-insurgency campaign.
Orly Marcellana, husband of Eden Marcellana who was the secretary-general of the group Karapatan-Southern Tagalog, joined a picket protest at the National Bureau of Investigation on Taft Avenue in Manila at around 10 a.m. Wednesday, with other Karapatan members and militant groups to demand justice for their fallen comrades, whose deaths they blamed on Palparan.

Marcellana, a farmer who lives in Quezon, expressed belief that Palparan killed his wife because she was a vocal critic of the retired general. “Palparan texted her, saying that he would kill her if she ever laid a foot in Mindoro,” said Marcellana.
Eden and a peasant activist, Eddie Gumanoy, the chairman of the Katipunan ng Samahang Magbubukid sa Timog Katagalugan (Gathering of Peasant Groups in Southern Tagalog) were killed in 2003 in Oriental Mindoro.  Eden also left behind two children, both girls, ages 16 and 18.FEATURED STORIES

“Palparan claims these people were members of the New People’s Army. How can we verify that now that they are dead or missing?” said Karapatan spokesperson June Ver Mangao. 
Marcellana said that for now, he and others wanting justice for their slain loved ones could only monitor Palparan’s case.
“Palparan should not be given any kind of special treatment. If that happens, you will see more of us protesting on the streets,” said Marcellana.

Fernando Baldomero was taking his 12-year-old son to school when he was shot by two motorcycle-riding men in front of his house.
The killing of Baldomero, an activist and a municipal councilor at Lezo, Aklan province, on July 5, 2010, posed an early challenge to the then newly installed President Aquino.

There were six killings during Aquino’s first week in office.
In his first State of the Nation Address (Sona) later that month, Aquino said the suspects in the Baldomero case and in two other cases had been identified. “We will not stop the pursuit of (those involved in) these killings until justice has been achieved. We will hold the murderers accountable,” he said.FEATURED STORIES

Five years later, and with Aquino’s final Sona to be delivered Monday, Baldomero’s family has not attained justice.
“It’s very ironic that his father (Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr.) was also a victim of extrajudicial killing. We had hoped that he would put a stop to impunity but the opposite has happened,” said Ernan, Baldomero’s eldest son. 
As of June 2015, there were 262 cases of extrajudicial killings, including Baldomero’s, according to the Karapatan human rights group.
“The situation is still very worrisome,” said Carlos Conde, a researcher for the Asia division of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. “While we recognize that the numbers have gone down compared with (those during) the term of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the same policy continues,” he said.
US also alarmed
The “insufficient” response of the Aquino administration on the issue of extrajudicial killings prompted Human Rights Watch and similar groups in the United States to write to the US Senate in July urging it to continue to impose restrictions on military funding for the Philippines.
“Every appropriations bill since 2008 has imposed a restriction on foreign military financing to the Philippines because of its military’s alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings,” the human rights groups said in their letter.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


They noted that activists, human rights defenders, church workers, labor organizers and antimining advocates had been targeted in Philippine military counterinsurgency operations.
Peasants are the most common victims of extrajudicial killings with 158 documented cases, followed by indigenous people with 63, Karapatan said.
License to kill 
“The pattern of abuses is very much the same with the previous regime. They are targeted, threatened, harassed and vilified as communists or communist sympathizers. That gives the military the license to kill them,” said Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay.
“Once you start red-baiting, it would be easy to kill them since the military’s mentality is that if you’re a communist, you’re an enemy, regardless of the fact that being a communist is not illegal,” Conde said.
Before he was killed, Baldomero was labeled as the leader of the communist movement in Aklan by officers of the 3rd Infantry Division, according to Ernan.
Baldomero, provincial chair of the militant Bayan Muna party-list group, was once a member of the New People’s Army. After being released from jail, he put up a lumber business and settled in Lezo.
When he was killed, he had just been reelected municipal councilor.
Who was mastermind?
Baldomero’s case has been archived at the Aklan Regional Trial Court as the suspect has not been arrested.


“Since the police have filed a case against a suspect, the killing is deemed solved. But there’s no thorough investigation to arrest the suspect and prove if it was really he who killed my father,” said Ernan, now vice president of Hustisya, an organization of families of victims of extrajudicial killings.
“I want to know who the mastermind was. Who gave the order? The suspect must have been a hired killer,” Ernan said.
According to Conde, for impunity to end, the criminal justice system must be in working order.
“There have been efforts to reform the system by declogging the courts and making the police, the courts and the Department of Justice work harmoniously. But the impact is not that significant to make a dent on the problem,” he said.
One of the campaign promises Aquino failed to keep was to revoke Executive Order No. 546. The EO, signed in 2006 by then President Arroyo, has allowed political warlords like members of the Ampatuan clan to create their own private armies “which (are) responsible for a lot of abuses,” Conde said.
Palparan’s case
According to Conde, a “plus point” for Aquino was the arrest of retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan in 2014.
Palparan has been labeled “The Butcher” by militants for his alleged role in the torture and killing of activists. He is being tried in a Bulacan court for his supposed involvement in the disappearance of University of the Philippines students Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeño.
The students’ families and activists protested the “rock star treatment of the Butcher” when Palparan was transferred from the Bulacan jail to the military barracks in Taguig City.
Palabay also lamented that farmer-activist Jonas Burgos and others who disappeared during the Arroyo administration remain missing. Every year, Edita Burgos, Jonas’ mother, reminds Aquino of his promise to find out the truth about her son’s disappearance.


With the promotion of military officials implicated in these abuses, “we think this last year of Mr. Aquino will be a bloody one in terms of human rights violations,” Palabay claimed.
She said the military’s counterinsurgency campaign was missing the point. “Killing protesters is not the way forward. The way forward is to institute meaningful reforms to resolve the economic crisis,” she said.
Human Rights Watch is looking into two other tracks of extrajudicial killings—media killings and summary executions by death squads.
Last chance
“This cannot go on, this breakdown of law and order,” Conde said. “If the rule of law works, the government should be able to prosecute military personnel who are implicated. It can (also) prosecute politicians, police officers implicated in the killings of journalists (and) ordinary citizens.”
In a statement, Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Aquino’s final Sona was his best and last chance “to demonstrate that his human rights commitments are not empty political rhetoric.”
“President Aquino’s record on human rights is five years of squandered opportunity,” Kine said.
Task Force Usig
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) Chair Jose Luis Martin Gascon claimed there was a marked decline in extrajudicial killings from 2010 to 2014, compared to the years before the Aquino administration. But he conceded the murders had not stopped despite the administration’s concerted efforts to stop them because of the slow rate of convictions and the culture of impunity.
“The perpetrators believe they can evade prosecution,” Gascon said.


Data from the Philippine National Police showed that from July 1, 2010, there had been 11 cases of activists killed because of their work or ideological inclinations. The PNP’s Task Force Usig is mandated to monitor cases of extrajudicial or political killings, as well as murders of journalists.
Of the 11 cases, four have been filed in court while two are in the preliminary investigation stage. Four are now considered to be “cold cases.”
There were also 14 cases of mediamen killed in the same period, which the PNP said were considered an attack on press freedom. Ten of the cases are with the courts while one has resulted in a conviction.
Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 35 creating a committee to handle extrajudicial killings and other human rights violation cases.
“The challenge is to see that the actions taken result in convictions and to completely stop (the killings),” Gascon said.
The CHR has quick reaction teams to assist people whose rights or lives are under grave threat. It also investigates extrajudicial killings.
According to Gascon, the CHR is also the convenor of the National Monitoring Mechanism that works with human rights advocates and law enforcers to monitor the prosecution of cases and bring attention to new ones.
‘Political bossism’
The PNP and the Armed Forces have also set up their own human rights affairs offices.
Gascon said these were some of the steps the administration had taken to address the problem as the President promised in his 2010 and 2011 Sonas.


But it would require the concerted efforts of all stakeholders to create a robust justice system, he said.
“Other reforms must begin (to stop) this culture of impunity, such as political bossism, proliferation of loose firearms and the breakdown of law and order,” he said.
Losing hope
Baldomero’s family deplored the government failure to solve his murder.
“(The President) promised that he will be given justice. But no one has been arrested,” Ernan said.
He said his family was losing hope those behind the murder would be punished because “even the President’s promise has not been good enough.”
On Aug. 3, 2010, the Aklan police filed a murder complaint against Dindo Ancero, a resident of Bogo City in Cebu, and unidentified men in connection with the murder.
The RTC later ordered the arrest of Ancero but the case was archived due to the authorities’ failure to arrest Ancero.
Protest actions
“As the most powerful person in the country, (Aquino) can very well ensure that my father’s killers are caught along with the mastermind. But he has failed to do so,” Ernan said.


Baldomero’s family and colleagues had blamed military agents or hired assassins for the killing.
Baldomero’s unsolved murder will be among the issues to be raised in protest actions during the Sona. Protests will be held in Iloilo, Capiz and Aklan.
In Estancia town in Iloilo, about 1,000 mostly survivors of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) will also join a protest rally to decry the failure of government to distribute housing assistance to survivors.
Typhoon survivors will also join rallies in Aklan and Capiz, according to Bayan.

“So that’s why the Commission on Human Rights is really asking for more support so that we might be able to address these cases,” Gascon said.
He pointed out a recent case in Central Luzon where a juvenile who was under detention was later found dead. 
“These things should not be the norm,” the CHR chief said, “So while the overall cases have dwindled, the fact that there are sharp increases in enforced disappearance, extrajudicial killings and torture [are] a matter of concern.”
Gascon could not immediately provide, however, the number of cases recorded by the CHR but said it has a database system on such incidents.
“Pero ang matingkad since 2005 onwards, e nag-increase overall although this year, sa usapin ng enforced disappearance, zero,” he further said.
(It’s clear that from 2005, onwards, the cases have increased overall, but this year, zero enforced disappearance has been reported.)
During the hearing on the proposed budget of the CHR, Gascon also told the committee that new reports of extrajudicial killings are recorded almost on a weekly basis. IDL

Body of man found with hands cut off,"01:14 AM June 04, 2016","BACOLOD CITY—The body of a man, believed to be a suspected thief and drug user, with multiple gunshot wounds and with his hands cut off was found in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, in a case believed to be an example of the extrajudicial killings of crime suspects that could soon be the norm.
It is an image that could become common sight soon in streets nationwide following pronouncements made by President-elect Rodrigo Duterte of a brutal campaign against drug trafficking and crimes.

The dead man has been identified as Jeffrey Buencuchillo, 33. He had multiple gunshot wounds in different parts of the body. His hands had been cut off.
The body was tied when found in the village of Zone 15 in Talisay City, indications he was abducted before he was executed gangland style.FEATURED STORIES

Found near where his body lay was a cardboard with a message that read “Ako usa ka Akyat Bahay, kawatan, adik. Ayaw ko ninyo sunda kay kamu na pod ang sunod patyon (I am a member of Akyat Bahay, a thief, a drug user. Don’t follow my example because you will be killed next).”
Senior Supt. William Senoron, police director of Negros Occidental, said Buencuchillo, of Victorias City, was identified by his sister. 
A female witness told the police that the victim was in the company of three other men on Wednesday night at the Shopping Center in Bacolod City.
Senoron initially dismissed speculations about the existence of an anticrime “vigilante group” that could be behind the killing.
Should there be one, Senoron said he would not tolerate it.
“We are a government of laws, and not of men,” he said.

Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat sought an inquiry in aid of legislation on the spate of “extrajudicial killings” of suspected criminals at the start of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.
In House Resolution No. 61, Baguilat, a member of the Liberal Party, called on Congress to investigate the “spate of extrajudicial killings and/or summary executions of suspected violators of laws on illegal drugs and other suspected criminals.”

He also cited Article III, Section 14 paragraph 1 which reads “No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.”
Baguilat also said the charter states that “in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved…” 
Bagulat said since Duterte assumed office on June 30, at least 23 persons suspected of violating laws against illegal drugs were killed by law enforcers “under vague circumstances.”
He added that even before Duterte’s inauguration, at least 68 drug suspects were killed in police operations in the country from January 1 to June 15, and 25 more were killed from June 16 to 20, “demonstrating a shocking increase in police-perpetrated killings.”
Meanwhile, the Philippine National Police reported 22 suspected drug-related killings outside police operations from May 14 to June 30, Baguilat said.
Baguilat said the spate of summary killings on the hands of the police who were mandated to enforce the rule of law is a violation of the constitutional right of suspected criminals.
BACKSTORY: Duterte vows to continue killing criminals ‘in accordance with law’

“The seemingly unchecked outbreak of extrajudicial killings executed by civil servants trusted by the people to enforce the law indicates a violation of the Constitution…” Baguilat said.
Baguilat also said the extrajudicial killings represent a “deterioration of the rule of law which can lead to people taking the law into their hands,” thereby leading the country towards the path of “lawlessness and anarchy.”
“There is therefore a clamor from the public and government officials alike to look into the disturbing trend of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug criminals,” Baguilat said.
“It behooves Congress, as the people’s instrument for securing social order through the establishment of just laws and thus the rule of law, to scrutinize the circumstances behind the aforementioned killings, with a view to ensuring that the people’s rights and lives are protected, especially by law enforcers,” he added.
Baguilat expressed alarm over the summary killings of criminals, a quick fix supported by President Duterte to eradicate criminality and illicit drug abuse in the country. IDL

They were tagged as members of the Salvacion Briones crime group that operated in Metro Manila and nearby Bulacan and Cavite provinces.
They were supposed to be entrapped by the District Anti-illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group in a buy-bust operation in the wee hours of Monday on C.P. Garcia Avenue near Magiting Street, Barangay UP Campus. 
At 1:15 a.m., PO3 Joebert Garcia, the designated poseur buyer, met with the suspects who arrived at the area in a silver Toyota Innova. They were supposed to sell him 50 grams of “shabu” worth P100,000.
According to a report prepared by Garcia, he was about to call his backup unit hiding nearby when the suspects pulled out handguns and fired at him, hitting him in the back. He escaped unharmed, however, because he was wearing a bulletproof vest.
Ignacio and Earl were killed on the spot by the responding officers after an exchange of gunfire, while the two other suspects were able to flee “on a motorcycle,’’ Garcia said.
But the two men on the bike were later cornered on Maharlika Street near Elliptical Road. The QCPD said they were asked to surrender but still fired at the pursuing team.
The QCPD said the four suspects were carrying four .45-cal. pistols, and in their vehicle they kept a kilo of shabu, a weighing scale, a stainless steel spoon and  five aluminum foil strips.

Eleazar described them as members of a group whose leader, Briones, and accomplices Aswanie Dipatuan, Albert Monitor and Amilojack Briones were arrested late last year.
The QCPD chief on Monday said 12 drug suspects had been killed in police operations in the city since July 1. He stressed that the suspects initiated the gunfights.
Since the start of the month, 273 drug users and peddlers have been arrested by the QCPD, while more than 2,000 voluntarily surrendered to their respective barangay officials and were turned over to the district command, the official added. With reports from Jenele Mane and Pam Castro

He was referring to the killing of Macario Ignacio, 45, of Bitas village in Cabanatuan City who was shot by a motorcycle-riding gunman in the afternoon of July 6.

“Who are we to say they were hopeless and that they should die?” said Bishop Broderick Pabillo in his 14-minute homily at a Mass  on Monday at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Ermita, Manila, which marked the launch of the Church’s “Huwag Kang Papatay” (Thou Shall Not Kill) campaign.

When the authorities took their lives, they were deprived of their right to repent and change their lives, Pabillo said.

The Mass was intended to stir the public into grieving and praying for the families of the slain victims. Supporters of the campaign flocked to the church in black but none of the victims’ relatives showed up.
“They’re scared to come forward,” Jojo Roberto, the lay coordinator of the Church’s ministry on public affairs, told the Inquirer. 
Roberto said that among the three family members invited, only one confirmed but backed out before the 5 p.m. Mass.
Fajardo said hundreds of people were killed so the real culprits would go unpunished. But what’s alarming to the Church was not only the spate of killings, but the silence of the public.
“It’s only OK until your family becomes the victim. You may change your mind after that, but then it would be too late,” Pabillo said in a separate interview.
Pabillo said the Catholic Church launched its campaign for fear the act of killing would eventually become acceptable as the culture and norm for the Filipino people.
They also wanted to remind the public that the country’s crime rate would not go down if the solution employed was committing another form of crime—murder.

“We are not even sure if those killed were really criminals because there was no due process. How can we believe that?” said Pabillo.
At the end of the Mass, the churchgoers lit candles and offered flowers for the victims’ souls.
“They have souls, too. We are forgetting that they have souls,” said Fajardo.
Sympathizers flocked to the church to express sympathy for the relatives and express support for the campaign.
Edna Yanga, a teacher at De La Salle in Lipa City, said those who remain silent on the killings must realize they could be next.
“If we keep silent on this issue, it would seem that we are agreeing,” Yanga said.

Buhay Representative Lito Atienza on Wednesday urged President Rodrigo Duterte to address the brutal summary killings of suspected drug pushers that hark back memories of the atrocities under martial law.
The horrifying scenario of slain drug suspects with faces covered with masking tape, hogtied and dumped on the streets of the metropolis has the same feel of the atrocities and human rights violations during the regime of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos when he imposed martial law, the pro-life lawmaker said during the press conference of the minority bloc.

“Walang kalaban laban ang mga suspek (The suspects were killed without a fight),” he added of the summary killing of victims.
Atienza acknowledged that the dictator declared martial law at the time thousands of communist rebels are going up the mountains, but Duterte has to become wary of what’s going on if he does not want to suffer the same downfall as that of Marcos. 
The dictator was toppled in a people’s uprising in Feb. 1986 that propelled to power the late president Corazon “Cory” Aquino, the widow of the opposition senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. who was slain during the Marcos regime.
“The command responsibility will take over the good intentions of the president. Eventually, he’ll be blamed for all of these, in the same way we blamed Marcos for martial law,” Atienza said.
“I want him to succeed. He should take note of what’s going on. Hindi tama ito (This is not right), it must be corrected immediately,” he added.
Atienza said Duterte may not even be aware of the abuses committed by the police who claimed the drug suspects were killed for resisting arrest.
“’Yung patayan na nangyayari (The killings that are taking place), he may not even be aware of that… That’s why we keep on reminding him, ‘You better check, Mr. President. That’s why Marcos failed, you may fail if you’re not able to correct this. You’re well intentioned, legal orders are given, but if these abuses continue, aabot tayo dun sa sukdulan (we might resort to extreme measures),'” Atienza said.

Atienza said he cautioned the president against a possible downfall as that of Marcos because he does not want the president to fail in his war against drugs.
“Ayoko naman pumalpak si Pangulong Duterte. Maswerte tayo na nagkaroon tayo ng presidenteng ganito (I do not want President Duterte to fail. We are fortunate to have a president like him),” he added.
Atienza made the statement at the height of the divisive issue about Duterte’s go-signal to give Marcos a hero’s burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, despite the latter’s history of abuse and plunder during his two-decade regime. IDL

The rights to a fair trial, due process and justice “belong appropriately to all Filipinos, whether they be victims or suspects of a crime, whether they be rich or poor,” according to the legislators.
The LP lawmakers, who are part of the majority coalition in the House, also demanded a stronger statement from the House leaders to denounce all illegal measures to fight drug trafficking.

“The summary executions are a false solution. In the long term, human rights abuses can only hurt our country and its potential for genuine peace and prosperity,” said the lawmakers.
Amid the loud protests from international human rights groups against the slaughter being carried out by the police and vigilantes, the LP lawmakers noted the lack of public outcry against the rising body count.

Siaron made money by driving a pedicab—a bicycle with a sidecar—and did odd jobs.
He voted for Mr. Duterte in the May 9 presidential election, Olayres said in an interview with the Inquirer on Sunday. 
Olayres, 26,  is not a registered voter, but she said she, too, would have voted for Mr. Duterte “because we wanted an end to crime.”
Six weeks after Siaron cast his vote for the candidate who promised to wipe out the illegal drug trade, he became part of the statistics, falling along with five other men gunned down by suspected vigilantes in Pasay and Manila early on July 23.
The night before he was gunned down, Siaron had dinner at his father’s  fruit stall at the rotunda and bought a P30-“lumpiang shanghai” meal for his wife. Then he returned to his job, never to come home again.
From their shack built on a trash-clogged creek in Barangay Santo Niño in the rundown part of Pasay City, Olayres ran barefoot to Taft Avenue when a friend called out that Siaron had been shot.
 ‘Nobody helped him’

Recalling the moment she found her husband’s body, she said she thought he was just hit by a stray bullet and could still be alive. But he was dead.
“When I was cradling him, I was thinking, ‘How long have you been lying here?’ Nobody bothered to help him. I was furious,” Olayres said, speaking at the Santo Niño barangay hall under the elevated tracks of the LRT where the body of her husband lay in a white coffin.
“Thoughts were running in my mind. ‘It can’t be you. You don’t deserve this. There are others who deserve this more than you,’” she said in a separate interview with Reuters.
“If only I had wings, I would quickly fly to his side,” she said.
Photographers surrounded her behind a police cordon as she cuddled her husband’s body. A piece of cardboard was left next to his body with the words “drug pusher” written on it.
Inquirer photo
The next day, the Inquirer published a front-page photo of a weeping Olayres cradling the body of Siaron, a heartbreaking image that went viral on the internet, sounding a global alarm over human rights violations in the Philippines.
But that picture failed to touch Mr. Duterte. He mentioned it in his inaugural State of the Nation Address to Congress on July 25, calling it melodramatic and seeking to evoke “Pieta,” the 1499 sculpture of Michelangelo depicting a heart-rending scene from the Deposition of Jesus.
“You are portrayed in a broadsheet like [the Virgin] Mary cradling the [body] of Jesus Christ. Let’s do drama here,” Mr. Duterte said in his speech in response to the public outrage inspired by the photo.
Church groups, rights advocates and some sections of the media have criticized Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs and expressed alarm at what they have termed extrajudicial killings.


More than 500 people, mostly poor drug users, have been killed since Mr. Duterte was elected.
As of July 30, the statistics stood at 525 killed: 170 in vigilante attacks and 355 during police operations.
‘No mercy’
In his maiden policy speech, Mr. Duterte declared there would be no letup in the campaign, ordering police and local officials to “double your efforts, triple them if need be.”
“We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars or below the ground if they so wish,” he said.
He vowed to show “no mercy,” warning criminals that priests and human rights advocates cannot protect them from death.
“If you don’t want to die, if you don’t want to get hurt, don’t rely on priests and human rights [advocates]. That won’t stop death,” he said.
Such words from the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City draw cheers from his supporters, hurting Olayres, who lamented that some people were unperturbed by the killings.
 ‘Difficult to accept’ 
“They’re happy because it hasn’t happened to them. What if they lose a loved one, someone who is not guilty of the offense?” Olayres said in the interview with the Inquirer. “It’s difficult to accept.”


“President Duterte hates pushers. I hope he himself will investigate the killings of people who have been judged with a cardboard,” she said, referring to the cardboard signs that read “drug pusher” left by the killers beside the bodies of their victims.
In the war on drugs, “they should go to the root,” she said, adding that her blood boiled after she saw the Inquirer photo in a blog that branded it as fake.
“I hope they think first before they judge. That kind of situation when you see someone you love slumped on the road, are you going to think of drama?” she said.
“I am not expecting justice for my husband. I know we won’t get that, especially since people believe the cardboards—cardboards that can never prove if the slain person is really a pusher. I just want to clear my husband’s name,” she said. Reports from the wires and Erika Sauler

BACOLOD CITY — The Diocese of Bacolod will be hanging a new tarpaulin to protest the rise of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects.
Starting Thursday (Aug. 4), a tarpaulin with the message “Thou shalt not kill” will hang in front of the San Sebastian Cathedral, the seat of the Bacolod Diocese here.

Fr. Felix Pasquin, rector of the San Sebastian Cathedral, said the tarpaulin would clearly convey the Church position against vigilantism in the same way that it showed its opposition to reproductive health law when it hanged its famous “Team Patay, Team Buhay” tarpaulin.
The “Team Patay, Team Buhay” tarpaulin listed down the names of senatorial candidates in 2013 elections who were in favor of or opposed to the reproductive health law.FEATURED STORIES

The Supreme Court last year ruled in favor of the Diocese of Bacolod that caught the ire of the Commission on Elections when it posted the tarpaulins.
The  Diocese of Bacolod would be standing up for the sacredness of human life, amid the mounting killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, Pasquin said. 
“We are in favor of the campaign against drugs, but are taking a strong stand against the rampant extrajudicial killings of drug suspects,” Pasquin said.
The Catholic Church has also been opposing the restoration of the death penalty based on moral principles and God’s commandment, he said, adding that “life is sacred and precious because it comes from God.”
He said priests in the Diocese of Bacolod have taken to the pulpit to express alarm over the rise in killings and the need to value life in consonance with the sixth commandment – “Thou shalt not kill.”
The “Thou shalt not kill” tarpaulin will be put up to catechize the people because killing is forbidden by God, according to Pasquin.
“While law enforcers’ killing in self defense is legitimate and accepted in the moral theology of the Church, how do we determine if the claim of self-defense is true?,” he said.

Pasquin said they received reports of vigilantism, and that those in the drug trade were killing their own people before they were exposed.
“Killing comes from the mouth of the President. Every time he speaks he says ‘I will kill you’ that has become part of our culture,” Pasquin said.
He stressed that the offender should be given a chance to reform and convert.
But once the offender was killed, he added, that would be the end of it.  SFM

This time, the Diocese of Bacolod is again standing up for the sacredness of human life, amid the mounting killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war against crimes, according to Pasquin. 
The messages of the tarpaulins are as follows: “Thou shalt not kill…drugs kill…crimes kill…corruption and poverty kill…abortion is killing…summary execution is killing. Life is sacred.”
Pasquin said the tarpaulins did not single out any person or group for censure, but condemned all forms of killing against the teachings of Christ.
“We are in favor of the campaign against drugs, but are taking a strong stand against the rampant extrajudicial killings of drug suspects,” Pasquin said.
The Church would also oppose the restoration of the death penalty based on moral principles and God’s commandment, he said, adding that “life is sacred and precious because it comes from God.”

“While law enforcers’ killing in self defense is legitimate and accepted in the moral theology of the Church, how do we determine if the claim of self defense is true?” he said.
Pasquin said they received reports of vigilantism, and drug trade leaders killing their own people to prevent them from surrendering to the police and confessing amid the government’s intensified war on drugs.
“Killing comes from the mouth of the President. Every time he speaks he says ‘I will kill you,’ that has become part of our culture,” Pasquin said.
He stressed that the offender should be given a chance to reform and convert.
But no reform and conversion could happen in the killing spree apparently being encouraged by government, said Pasquin.
Pasquin said the Catholic church would help government in the rehabilitation of surrendered drug users, especially in the aspect of spiritual formation.
He said parishes in the Diocese of Bacolod would hold a regular recollection to raise funds for the rehabilitation of drug suspects.
Spiritual formation is the most important aspect of rehabilitation, according to Paquin.  SFM

The NBI’s “human sketch” on the other hand showed that Dela Riarte sustained four gunshot wounds.
Dela Riarte was arrested last July 29 after he figured in a road altercation with another motorist, Eric Fajardo. He was handcuffed and supposed to be brought to Camp Crame but was shot along the way. 
On the other hand, based on the forensic report by PAO’s Forensic Laboratory conducted by Dr. Erwin P. Erfe, Dela Riarte sustained five entry wounds and two exit wounds.
Four of the entry wounds are in the chest, pelvic and front upper thigh while one was at the back of the right thigh.
“Isa po ay contact gunshot wound. Nakadikit sa dibdib nya nung binaril sya,” Dr. Erfe said at a press conference.
He added that based on the size of the wounds, it would appear that a .45 caliber was used when he was shot in the front while a .9mm was used to shoot him at the back of his right thigh.
“Entry wound is 15-25 degree angle. Acute yung angle maaaring nakadapa siya nung binaril siya sa likuran,” Erfe said.

He added that there were also handcuff marks on the victim and abrasions on his right pelvic area and buttocks.

LAWMAKERS from the majority coalition in the House of Representatives lauded President Duterte for quick changes he has introduced in the first 50 days of his administration.
In a press briefing on Thursday, the majority allies who are also high-ranking officers of the House appropriations committee said they were impressed at how Duterte implemented his campaign promise of cracking down on drugs in nearly two months of his watch.

Duterte vowed to eliminate drugs within the first six months of his term.
“I think, judging by the response of the people, in terms of their trust rating and satisfaction rating, performance rating…they responded very well to the President’s anti-drug campaign down to the purok level,” Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles said.FEATURED STORIES

A chairperson of the House appropriations committee, Nograles said the thousands of drug users surrendering to authorities, as well as Duterte’s issuance of a freedom of information (FOI) executive order covering the executive department, were indications that change has come as the President had promised in his presidential campaign.
“I think the first 50 days of the new President has been very productive and an excellent beginning to his presidency,” Nograles said. 
Nograles, however, failed to mention the hundreds of summary killings of drug suspects, some of whom were hogtied and slung with a cardboard signs saying “I am a pusher” and dumped in the streets of the metropolis since Duterte waged the war on drugs.
For his part, Zamboanga City Rep. Celso Lobregat described Duterte’s first 50 days in three words – “shock and awe.”
“Change is here and the President is serious in what he’s doing. And the effect is really shocking to those who are sort of guilty, and awe to those who wanted change,” Lobregat said.
PBA Rep. Mark Sambar said Duterte’s first 50 days provided proof that his promise of change is possible.
“For the first 50 days, our President has delivered on his promise of change. it’s very apparent naman. We have a lot of campaign promises that he made during the campaign period, one by one he’s starting to deliver…,” Sambar said.

Sambar said with the support of Congress, “(Duterte’s) dream of having a very clean, corrupt- and crime-free Philippines is really possible.”
“Nakikita ng tao na pwede pala. I think the 50 days is a good example of that,” Sambar said.
Quezon City Rep. Alfred Vargas, a member of the erstwhile ruling Liberal Party, said he was impressed that in his own district alone, at least a thousand drug users have surrendered to police in the first 50 days of Duterte’s administration.
“For me, as an LP who’s a member of the majority, so far so good ang performance ng President dito. Particularly sa peace and order. More than 1,000 in my district sumuko voluntarily. Before hirap na hirap ang [mga pulis na] hulihin. In 50 days, more than 1,000 na sumuko. I think that’s a good sign,” Vargas said.
Iloilo Rep. Oscar Garin said Duterte exceeded his expectations for accomplishing a lot in 50 days as opposed to his promise of making an impact in the first six months of his administration.
“It was beyond our expectation that the President did it so fast instead of waiting for six months. Just 50 days, he did it so fast,” Garin said./rga

Update
MANILA — A 53-year-old drug suspect who surrendered to the police early last week under the Oplan Tokhang program was shot dead by two unidentified men onboard a motorcycle at West Crame, San Juan City, on Sunday evening.

A report reaching Chief Superintendent Romulo Sapitula, Eastern Police District director, stated that Marcelino Milvar, alias Maxe, (not Tomasito as earlier reported), a resident of Road 9, 1st West Crame, was standing along Talipapa Road when one of the gunmen who wore helmets and masks, alighted from the black motorcycle and shot him repeatedly in different parts of the body around 7:45 pm.

He had two gunshot wounds in the head and two in the back.
A bystander was grazed by one of the six bullets fired by the gunmen. 
A witness who asked not to be identified, said that shortly after the attack, they saw four masked men on two motorcycles holding orange bags fleeing from the crime scene.
The four masked men told witnesses to give way as they sped away on their motorcycles.
Barangay officials said there was no policeman in the area at that time, and a fireworks display was ongoing in line with the Nazarene procession when Milvar was killed. “It might have been planned,” they said.
According to West Crame Village councilor Buboy Nonato, Milvar and his wife Tess were on the police’s drug watch list.
Only Milvar, however, was forced to surrender after the fourth “knock” on his door by members of the Eastern Police District last Wednesday, Nonato said.

Tess, who was also a suspected pusher, reportedly left their home after her husband was killed.
There were reports of drug dens around the Philippine National Police Camp Crame.
“Matagal na po iyon. Pero meron pa rin po (Those have long been there.  They have stayed on),” a barangay officer who requested anonymity, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
Since July, around 95 drug suspects in Barangay West Crame have surrendered to the police.
Oplan Tokhang is the PNP campaign wherein policemen go to the homes of known drug pushers and users in the community to persuade them to surrender and undergo drug rehabilitation.
An investigation is ongoing. SFM

DAGUPAN CITY―Maximo Garcia, 53, surrendered to the police on Saturday after he was told that he was on a drug watch list.
Three days later, a man approached his house at Barangay Mayombo at 12:30 p.m. and opened fire on Garcia as he and his family were having lunch.

Garcia fled to the back of the house but was shot and wounded by the gunman. His 5-year-old granddaughter, Danica May, was hit in the head and later died in hospital, the youngest fatality and latest collateral damage in President Duterte’s war on illegal drugs.

He had been helping his wife Gemma operate a small eatery in front of their house provided by the Department of Social Welfare and Development in the flood-prone barangay.
The wife said earnings went to food, Garcia’s medicines and caring for Danica, whose 29-year-old mother has separated from her husband. 
But life had been good for Danica, Gemma said.
Danica had always been excited about attending kindergarten at East Central Elementary School here, the woman said. The child would take a bath early, eat her lunch and head for school.
“This is so painful to us,” she said. “I would miss the nights when Danica would massage us until we fell asleep. I would miss her laughter when she teased her mother.”
Gemma said she was surprised to learn that her husband was on the police drug watch list. He was later persuaded by the barangay captain to surrender to clear his name and also for his own safety.
She said she could not understand why anyone would attack her husband, who she said had never been involved in illegal drugs.

“We are afraid to stay here. But the problem is where will we go? The killers may come back for my husband,” she said.
Supt. Neil Miro, Dagupan police chief, theorized that drug dealers were behind the attack.
As of Tuesday, 26 suspected drug dealers had been killed in the city, four of them in a clash with police, Miro said.
Bulacan beheading
In Bulacan province on Monday night, a 14-year-old boy was beheaded allegedly by his drug-crazed uncle in the City of San Jose del Monte.
The boy’s body bore multiple stab wounds when it was found by his family members on a dump in Barangay Minuyan Proper at 10 p.m., hours after witnesses saw him fleeing from his uncle, who was wielding a knife, said Supt. Wilson Magpali, San Jose del Monte police chief.
On Tuesday, the police arrested the attacker, who led them to a place near a river where the boy’s head was buried. The suspect was incoherent when policemen detained him.
Also on Tuesday at Barangay San Jose in Quezon City, three drug suspects were killed in an encounter with police during a “buy-bust operation” at 2:35 a.m.
Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, city police chief, identified one of the fatalities as Rodolfo Hallare, 48. The two other slain suspects remain unidentified but policemen estimated them to be between 20 and 30 years old.
Operatives said one of their colleagues posed as a buyer of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) and bought from Hallare and his group. Hallare was about to receive payment when his partners shouted they were around, triggering a gunfight.


Recovered from the scene were two .45-cal. pistols, one
.38-cal. revolver, three plastic sachets of shabu and P1,490 cash.
As of Wednesday, 56 drug suspects have been killed in police operations in Quezon City since July 1.
Eleazar, however, said that more than 700 drug suspects did not resist arrest. With reports from Carmela Reyes-Estrope, Inquirer Central Luzon; and Maricar Brizuela in Quezon City

Garcia said De Lima refused to have her photograph taken with the family members and neighbors, and did not grant an interview request from a local TV reporter.
De Lima was escorted to the area by police officers manning the community precinct in Mayombo, the village where the Garcias reside. 
Garcia’s husband Maximo, the target of the gunman, was shot and wounded and was still being treated for a stomach injury, as of Sunday.
Four days before the attack, he surrendered to the police in order to clear his name, after being told that he was on a police drug watch list.
The police identified Bryan Macaayao as the gunman, and have filed murder and frustrated murder cases against him. The same charges were also filed against an unidentified accomplice who drove the motorcycle they used to flee the crime scene.
Senator Leila de Lima has been heading a Senate inquiry into the spate of drug-related killings that have gripped the nation since President Duterte ordered his policemen to wage a war against illegal drugs.  De Lima suspects that rogue cops involved in illegal drugs have been summarily executing drug pushing suspects who could turn witness against them.
President Duterte, thinking De Lima has unfairly tainted the entire Philippine National Police’s campaign against illegal drugs, has alleged that De Lima accepted drug protection money when she was Department of Justice secretary and had jurisdiction over the New Bilibid Prison, where criminals were believed to be directing drug trafficking operations. SFM

ILOILO CITY — The families of the slain suspected drug lord, Melvin Odicta,  and wife Meriam Odicta, will not file any case amid lingering questions on how the couple were killed and who ordered it.
“We are not interested in filing any cases or to press for an investigation. We want peace for the sake of their children and love ones left behind,” Barangay Tanza-Esperanza Chairman Noel Odicta, Melvin’s younger brother, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer, at the Odicta residence on Wednesday.

The village official also appealed to President Duterte and Philippine National Police Director General Ronald Dela Rosa:  “Mr. President and General Bato. We have accepted what had happened to them. We are innocent and we are not involved in whatever they have been accused of. The past is past. If they have done wrong, we apologize. They are already dead,” Noel said.

The couple had denied these allegations and had insisted that they were operators and owners of legitimate businesses.
They went to Manila and met with Interior Secretary Ismael “Mike” Sueno on Aug. 25, to clear their names and to seek security assistance amid concerns of a rubout. 
The next day, on Aug. 26, Dela Rosa dismissed Odicta’s denial and confirmed that the Iloilo businessman was the top drug lord in the region.

The Philippine National Police (PNP) has filed 628 criminal cases before the courts in connection with a spate of “mysterious” deaths or so-called summary killings since President Rodrigo Duterte waged his war on drugs.
During the appropriations committee hearing on the Department of Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) proposed P148.73-billion budget in 2017, PNP Director General Ronald “Bato” de la Rosa was asked by Kabayan Rep. Harry Roque about the latest death toll of drug suspects.

Dela Rosa said the police had filed charges over so-called “mysterious deaths” or “deaths under investigation,” or the killings that occurred outside legitimate police antidrug operations.
Del Rosa said of the 1,507 reported deaths, the police had filed 628 cases in court. 
He cited the killings of father and son Renato and Jaybee Bertes, who was arrested by the Pasay City police for drug possession. After the two allegedly tried to grab the police officer’s gun, they were shot inside the police station. The police officers face murder charges in connection with the incident.

“Wala kaming pinapabayaang death. Everytime, iniimbestigahan namin. We are constantly asking for update … Kaya nagkaroon ng 628 filed cases because of consistent follow up,” De la Rosa said.
“That seems to be very good. That would indicate that the PNP is discharging its functions to investigate and after the Department of Justice will prosecute and later the court will convict these killings,” Roque said.
Roque maintained that all deaths, whether outside or during legitimate police operations, should be investigated by the police.

“Lahat ng deaths should be considered as deaths. In my mind, we should be investigating these deaths, regardless of mysterious deaths or in relation to ongoing war against drugs,” Roque said.
De la Rosa also said there was a discrepancy between the death toll of media outlets and that of the police because the reckoning period for the media was as early as May or immediately after Duterte won the elections, while the police started tallying upon the President’s assumption of office on June 30./rga

In July, Anita and 179 others showed up at the police station in the village of Subangdaku in Mandaue City as part of “Oplan Tokhang,” a police campaign to persuade users and pushers to cease their involvement in drugs.
A month later, she went to the pastoral center of San Roque Parish in Subangdaku and joined 90 others who were told about the barangay-based recovery and reintegration program. 
No shortcuts
Ugnayan ng mga Barangay at Simbahan (Ubas) launched the pilot long-term program for drug dependents last Aug. 28. “In the fight against illegal drugs, there can be no shortcuts,” said Fr. Carmelo Diola, the lead convener.
Diola stressed that the Catholic Church and other sectors of society should not just watch as addicts waste away. “If we don’t reach out to them, their co-drug addicts will,” he said. “The opposite of addiction is connection.”
In Central Visayas, at least 71,000 pushers and users have “surrendered” to the police in Cebu, Siquijor and Bohol provinces since July. They are too many for the 45 rehabilitation centers in the country, six of which are in Cebu.
The centers can accommodate  only up to 5,000, so the Church decided to create the community-based program to rehabilitate users.
ADVERTISEMENT
 


Chief Supt. Noli Taliño, police director for Central Visayas, promised to support the Ubas program. He directed all city and provincial police directors and station police chiefs to help the group. “I will create a team to assist the Church in this endeavor,” he said.
Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma said the Church must provide a haven for drug addicts, stressing that they are not outcasts.
“Many lives have been destroyed by illegal drugs. But we should not despair,” Palma said. “There’s hope. I’m happy that people come together to find solutions to this problem.”
Ubas’ program consists of four stages: admission of addicts into the program, psychosocial intervention, capacity building and reintegration into society.
At the start, Diola said, the kind of help addicts need should be determined. Those who need extensive treatment must be brought to the rehabilitation centers, but those who do not will be offered free counseling and spiritual transformation in the community-based facilities.
Volunteers and psychiatrists from Magone Home of the Salesians of Don Bosco are helping out in the program, which started in Subangdaku where village officials, led by Ernie Manatad, and the local police are very cooperative.
But Ubas and the regional police force want to replicate the program elsewhere. “We need to transition from Tokhang to Labang (Lahat Bangon),” Diola said. “There can be no fence sitters in the campaign.”
The priest is no stranger to the evils of drugs. He and the Church-based Dilaab Foundation Inc. had actively campaigned against “narcopolitics” since the early 2000s.
He said the proliferation of drugs, though, was a result of the failure of the justice system, as well as the community’s apathy. “In a larger sense, illegal drugs have become a dominant reality due to the failure of all sectors to come together,” he said.
“Back then, it was a  very lonely fight. Now, the picture has completely changed. Those in illegal drugs are on the defensive,” he added.


‘Mother of all crimes’
Diola said he appreciated President Duterte’s campaign to rid the country of drugs and drug trafficking, which the priest branded as the “mother of all crimes.”
“Our society has just grown so used to the prevalence of drugs that we no longer pay attention to the countless rapes, murders and thievery brought by illegal drugs,” he said.
“Societies are teetering toward perdition as families slowly disintegrate in the face of the drug menace,” he said.
Diola said the failure of previous administrations to address the drug scourge had made it “spin out of control.”
While eradicating illegal drugs is badly needed, sustainable solutions must also be found, he said. He, however, cautioned against shortcuts in solving the problem, alluding to the summary executions of drug suspects.
From July 1 to Aug. 25, 73 suspected drug pushers were killed in police operations in Central Visayas, and 97, by unidentified assailants.
Aside from its community-based rehabilitation program, Diola said the Church also wanted to make people aware of the evils of drugs and to gradually remove the social stigma attached to addiction.
Public health issue
Addiction is primarily a public health issue, Diola said. He urged the government to stop treating drugs as mainly a law enforcement problem.


“This requires building more rehabilitation centers and adequately training and building the capability of its health workers to deal with drug addicts,” Diola said.
The business sector must also be willing to provide training and job opportunities for recovering addicts, he said.
Diola said the Roman Catholic Church and other denominations must do their share in addressing the problem.
“The spiritual dimension is essential. We need to realize that drug abuse is but a manifestation of human hearts remaining restless unless they rest in God,” he said.

295,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/22887/assault-on-sheriff-is-abuse-of-power-by-dutertes,Assault on sheriff is abuse of power by Dutertes,"03:07 AM July 11, 2011","The public outrage over the attack by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte on a sheriff serving a court’s demolition order has blown up into a national issue involving abuse of power of  elected local officials claiming autonomy from the central government.
What started as an attack on an officer of the court performing a judicial duty escalated into a full-blown controversy after Sheriff Abe Andres did the incredible thing of apologizing to the mayor, who had beaten him up after he refused her request to stay for two hours the demolition of squatter shanties in Agdao District.

The violent action by the mayor was caught live by TV cameras, establishing beyond doubt the fact of the assault on an officer of the court.  
Mayor Duterte and her father, former Mayor and now Vice Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, have turned the tables on the victim of official violence by making Andres apologize. FEATURED STORIES

The Dutertes made it appear they were the offended party, not the sheriff. 
It is not uncommon in the law of the jungle of the Philippine judicial system and in the relationship between powerful officials and weak bureaucrats that the latter end up the “lawbreakers,” as the more powerful enjoy impunity from prosecution and accountability. 
The Dutertes took refuge behind a false populist argument that the mayor had intervened to stop a demolition notice issued by a judge on the claim that she wanted to avert a riot by angry squatters. They claimed the sheriff was unreasonable in not granting a two-hour stay of execution. 
Sara Duterte further claimed she had rushed to the scene to stop the demolition after distributing relief goods to flood victims, as part of her duties to her constituents and as a manifestation of her compassion for the victims of calamities.
That is cheap populist posturing.
On the offensive
The Dutertes have now gone on an offensive to justify their violent actions and mobilize public opinion in their constituency in Davao.

The PR campaign seeks to turn the issue into a referendum approving their actions before criminal action is started by the national authorities.  
Whether these claims are valid excuses or whether the sheriff’s manner of executing the demolition order justified Sara Duterte’s flare-up, it is an inescapable fact that she faces possible criminal and administrative action for assaulting an officer of the court.
Being a public official, she cannot escape accountability for acts of violence related to the discharge of her official duties—acts she can be proceeded against by either her victim, by the Department of Justice, Department of the Interior and Local Government or Supreme Court for contempt of court.
She also risks disciplinary action by the Judicial and Bar Council, of which she is a member as a lawyer.
It’s up to these institutions to take action to teach her and her political clan a lesson that abuse of power is intolerable in a society that proclaims its adherence to the rule of law and eschews the violent impulses of officials whose egos are bruised by people who refuse to obey their demands.
Ampatuan warlords
Sara Duterte is on leave and her father, Rodrigo Duterte, acts in her absence and has ably taken up the cudgels on her behalf. He claims it was only proper for the sheriff to apologize, saying the demolition was “illegal, the sheriff was not supposed to be there.”
The elder Duterte said that under Republic Act No. 7279, local governments are required to give a 30-day notice for evictions. Assuming this to be correct, it should be asked, who gave the mayor the right and the power to summarily punish other officials for acts involving discharge of their duties.
To understand where the Dutertes are coming from, it is important to know that they belong to a class of local officials who believe they have local autonomy powers that put them above the national law. They rule their provincial jurisdictions with their own set laws, which make them unaccountable to the law of the land. 
The Ampatuan warlords of Maguindanao belong to this category. They operate under the state of mind that their local autonomy has given them the impunity to abuse their power. 


Dangerous doctrine
The Dutertes are now making a case for this dangerous doctrine in their populist campaign for an informal referendum in Davao.
Barangay captains of Davao City have published a manifesto of support for Sara Duterte. It says the governance of the elected leaders of Davao has been “put to a test.” It adds that the people of Davao have chosen a leader who has been “defending the safety and welfare of the poor and vulnerable.” 
This manifesto takes off from the creed of rule practiced by Rodrigo Duterte when he was mayor. Under his leadership, the city claims to have experienced relative peace and stability. Its crime rate dropped dramatically, prompting tourist organizations to boast that Davao “is the most peaceful city in Southeast Asia.” 
He was, however, criticized by human rights groups for supposedly tolerating extrajudicial killings of criminals allegedly by Davao death squads. He denied direct involvement in those killings.
A human rights website, midfield.wordpress.com., reports a statement attributed to Duterte in February 2009:  “If you are doing an illegal activity in my city, if you are a criminal or part of a syndicate that preys on the innocent people of the city, for as long as I am the mayor, you are a legitimate target of assassination.”
Abuse of power
Human rights organizations report that Duterte and other local officials have continued to deny the existence of any death squads. But in recent years, mayors and officials of other cities “have made statements justifying similar killings in their own cities.” 
Davao City “is seen by some as a model for fighting crime,” according to the report. Human Rights Watch, based in New York, believed such killings had continued and perpetrators enjoyed “impunity largely because of the tolerance of, and in some cases, outright support from local authorities.”
It is not far-fetched to argue that the violent actions of Mayor Sara Duterte take a leaf from the culture of impunity engendered by the model set by ex-Mayor Rodrigo Duterte. 


The Davao community’s approval of the Duterte model of strongman rule does not wipe out the illegality of the assault on the officer of the court, no matter how offensive his action in serving the demolition order was to the Dutertes.
The attack was an assault on the entire judicial system.
Abuse of power is the underlying issue in this episode.

296,https://rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/new-case-extrajudicial-killing-marikina,"Victim plays dead: In Marikina, a new case of ‘extrajudicial killing’",,"MANILA, Philippines – The basketball court was crowded in the evening, a blue tent shielding the starless sky. The grieving and their children sat upright on plastic monobloc chairs as they listened to the female pastor preach about justice and God with a cracking subwoofer. Behind her lay a man they knew dearly.
Kim Lester Ramos, 23, loved playing basketball. He was short and thin, but the players who knew him said his feet moved with certainty. He spoke little but laughed often. He did not smoke. Only drank on birthdays and holidays. He was still more of a boy than a man. They all said he was kind.
That night, he rested inside the walls of a chalk-white casket, just under the shadow of a rusting ring where he dropped his three-pointers.
His face, calm, bulged below his right eyebrow. On October 5, a cop shot him within point-blank range from behind his head. Police said Kim tried to snatch a cornered cop’s gun. The cop won in the supposed tussle and shot Kim straight in the head.
The people of Mountain View Subdivision in Marikina City know a different story. They say they were the lucky ones in the government’s war, as not one of their men had been lost in a TokHang visit or buy-bust after thousands have been slain.
Confronted with their first case, they could not sleep. They said they could not stay silent either. On the rotting railings of the court hung a spread of black cloth painted red and orange that said “JUSTICE FOR KIM.” Posted a few steps away was a tarpaulin screaming the same, but with a label for Kim: “EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLING VICTIM.”
They were familiar with the stories of those killed in other neighborhoods. They were ready to fight back.
The witness and victim speaks out: ‘Pumikit na lang ako’
Lauro Lagarde, 22, told his story on a reclined white single bed inside a buzzing male ward of the Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center.
He remembered seeing darkness even before the sun set on October 5, the day he almost died. Lauro shut his eyes as he bled after being shot and falling from his motorcycle. He held his breath and lay still, pretending to be dead as Kim ran away.
The cop aimed his gun at Lauro’s chest, but Lauro shoved down the gun as the cop pulled the trigger. The bullet entered his left hip and came out of the left cheek of his buttocks.
He then heard the cop run after Kim, with seconds of slapping flipflops on the pavement before the gunshot. He peeked, just for a second, and saw his friend fall, face down on the pavement.
“Narinig ko na hinabol niya si Kim. Noong naramdaman kong hinabol niya si Kim, tiningnan ko kung ano ang gagawin niya. Binaril niya talaga,” Lauro said. (I heard him run after Kim. When I sensed that he was chasing Kim, I looked at what he would do next. He really shot him.)
Lauro forced his eyes shut once more. He choked back tears and screams.
Just an hour earlier, he was shooting hoops with Kim and another friend, Johnny. Lauro had just finished repolishing his motorcycle, a pink Mio, while Kim came from work at the Project 4 district in Quezon City. The court was their refuge.
They wanted to have supper at a nearby eatery but first decided to meet in front of Johnny’s house nearby. They sat by the gutter as they waited, Lauro teasing Kim for playing Mobile Legends, when a cop whizzed past them aboard a motorcycle then made a U-turn. The cop spoke with a man on the street they did not know, then looked to Kim and Lauro.
“Kayong mga adik magsitigil-tigil na kayo sa paggamit ng droga (You addicts, stop using illegal drugs already),” Lauro recalled the cop saying. Then the cop sped off, leaving the boys shocked.
As they rode the motor to supper, by coincidence, they caught up with the cop at the intersection of Mount Vernon Street and Gil Fernando Avenue. Lauro confronted the cop.
“Sir, bakit ‘nyo kami sinasabihan na adik (Sir, why are you calling us addicts)?” Lauro recalled asking the cop. That was when the cop pulled his gun and shot them.
Lauro kept his eyes shut until he heard the footsteps of people – witnesses. With all his strength, Lauro pulled out his phone from his right pocket to try and call his friends and to get an ambulance. The cop snatched his phone, spat at him with expletives, and said, “Pasalamat ka buhay ka pa (Be thankful you’re alive).”
The crowd then began taking photos of him and Kim, angering the cop. The cop pushed the people away, and while holding on to his pistol, ordered them to delete all the footage they took.
“Sabi niya, ‘Pulis ako, pulis ako,’” Lauro recalled. (He said, “I’m a cop, I’m a cop.”)
Lauro never got his phone back.
The rescue attempt: ‘Muntik na’
Christopher Ramos, 33, arrived first from among Kim’s family at the crime scene. He was panting as a curious crowd started to form. Cops marked their territory with the yellow line.
Inside the no-cross zone, Christopher saw Lauro groaning as he bled, and around 10 meters away, saw his cousin Kim lying, face down, his left hand holding a blue handkerchief, his right hand empty.
At around 6:45 pm, Christopher said there were around a dozen cops at the crime scene, 3 of them standing guard around his cousin. He began to panic as there was no ambulance in sight. The cops were just looking, he said.
Then Christopher saw Kim’s head twitch – a sign of life – and he quickly slipped past the police line and dashed towards the body. His calculation was simple: he would haul his cousin’s body to the Amang Rodriguez Medical Center, 10 minutes away, to save him, instead of waiting another minute for an ambulance.
“Mahahawakan ko na sana. Muntik na. Kung nahawakan ko ‘yun itatakbo ko talaga ‘yun eh (I almost touched him. I almost did it. If I had grasped him, I would have run and carried him away),” Christopher said, as he began to cry.
Before he could reach Kim, a policeman pushed him out. Christopher said he was Kim’s cousin. The cops didn’t appear to care. Even Kim’s father was kept out of the yellow line.
Christopher cried for cops to call an ambulance. Again, they just looked. Helpless, Christopher joined the rest who were staring at his cousin, praying that he would move again.
Kim had long stopped twitching when a funeral van picked him up from the scene.
The making of a coverup? ‘Pinabalik-balik kami’
When the van took off from the crime scene, Norman Ramos, 63, was already down the corner, standing to block its path. The only way he would leave, he said, was if he was let into the van. The funeraria men gave him the shotgun seat.
At the funeral parlor, Norman saw his son up close. Kim wore a white shirt and bright silver basketball shorts. His right eye was a red void, while his forehead and knees still bled from the fall on the asphalt.
Norman wanted to know what led to his boy’s killing. That same night, he went to the barangay hall, but was told that policemen kept the blotter. He went to the Marikina City Police Station, but was told to return in the morning. When he returned in the morning, he was told to come back after lunch. When he returned after lunch, he was asked to drop by again in an hour.
“Pinapabalik-balik lang ako (They only kept asking me to go back),” Norman said. He never got a police report.
Meanwhile, Lauro’s family was told about what happened only the next day. Lauro’s younger sister, Leslie, said she was also repeatedly asked by cops to return. They only found out about her brother’s case when a prosecutor and lawyer dropped by the hospital to hold bedridden Lauro for an inquest.
“Pinapabalik kami, 'yun pala, ginagawa na nila (They were asking us to return when in fact they were already working on it),” said Ansly Lagarde, Lauro’s eldest sister.
For Ansly and Leslie, ""working"" on the case meant the cops were working on a false narrative to spin the case against Kim and Lauro.
Even the media was informed late about the details of the encounter. In a news report dated October 7, the Journal reported that police announced the details in a “belated report.” (READ: Marikina cop shoots laborer in the head in alleged scuffle)
Other reporters have tried to speak with Lauro Lagarde inside the hospital, but he and his family said guards have been blocking reporters from entering, with or without cameras. 
Police accounts don’t add up: ‘Napilitan akong putukan’
In the affidavit of Police Corporal Herjonner Soller, he was the victim on October 5. His story presents an alternate reality to what Kim's and Lauro’s families have seen. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Soller is an intelligence officer. At 6:30 pm, he said he was on “surveillance operation” in civilian attire to keep track of their most wanted persons when he found 4 men whom he described as “kahina-hinalang nakatambay sa madilim na bahagi ng kalsada (suspiciously loitering at a dark part of the street).”
Soller said he introduced himself as a cop and asked them what they were doing, but the men supposedly said, “Pakialam mo (why do you care)?” and when he left, he claimed the men shouted without any prompting, “Hoy gago, p*tangina mo, gago ka (Hey bastard, you son of a bitch, you’re a bastard)!”
Soller said two of the men, Lauro and Kim, then followed him onboard their own motorcycle.
Without explaining how, he said that they all fell from their bikes when they reached the intersection of Mount Vernon Street and Gil Fernando Avenue. Soller then said Lauro snatched his “bag” which contained his pistol, ammo magazine, handcuffs, money, and his ID.
While pulling it, Soller was supposedly able to open his bag and take out his pistol. Soller then said that Lauro tried to grab his gun and hold it by the barrel. According to Soller, they fought for the gun until eventually the gun’s trigger was pulled, releasing a bullet into Lauro’s hip.
The cop did not account for what Kim was doing while the scuffle was happening.
In Soller’s story, Kim had a gun with him all along, but Kim apparently decided to run towards a tree after Lauro was shot. Soller said Kim pointed the pistol at him, forcing him to shoot. Even at a supposedly far range, Soller was able to shoot Kim’s head even as Kim supposedly turned his back on Soller.
Soller claimed he immediately called for his teammates to call an ambulance, contrary to what witnesses saw in the crime scene.
Soller’s affidavit also does not match the narrative presented to the media by Marikina police chief Colonel Restituto Arcanghel. The more senior cop told the Journal that Soller identified Ramos as being involved in robbery cases. Arcanghel also said Kim was part of the gun scuffle, which was not in Soller’s account.
A community takes a stand: ‘Hindi kami natatakot’
On the other side of the blue tent are metal bleachers packed with young-looking adults, Kim and Lauro’s church community, the Christian Walk Ministry, ready to fight for them.
The Christian Walk Ministry is a born-again Christian organization that leads weekly bible teachings and feeding programs for the poor. As expected, Kim and Lauro were among the top organizers of the community liga (basketball tournament), where even policemen joined.
“Hindi kami natatakot, kasi alam namin nasa tama kami (We are not afraid because we know that we are on the right side),” said Mary Jean Fulgar, one of the group’s most senior members.
Mary Jean watched the two boys grow up in the same court. She knew that they would not lift a pistol against anyone. They did not know how to use a gun. The kid Kim, she said, was even afraid of fireworks, triggering laughter from her companions.
Kim’s father Norman and Lauro’s siblings, meanwhile, have been bracing for battle in the legal arena. Lauro was accused of direct assault and attempted homicide, while Norman wants to clear his son’s name.
They have culled certificates from their barangay and the National Bureau of Investigation saying the two were neither drug personalities nor robbers. They have also spoken with the Commission on Human Rights and Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro to aid them in facing the police.
Kim will be buried on Sunday, October 13. His family and friends will use his funeral procession as a platform to protest killings and demand justice, much like those of drug war slain Caloocan teens Kian delos Santos and Carl Arnaiz, who were killed by cops and then framed as drug suspects.
The Marikina City police have already relieved Soller from his post as an investigation has been opened, but Norman Ramos wants cops to take a step further.
“Gusto kong maipakulong ‘yan, masampahan ng kaso kung anuman ang ginawa niya (I want him to be jailed, to face a case for what he did),” Norman said.
The men and women of Mountain View Subdivision are mourning the death of one of their own. With the pushback, they are making it clear that any cop who commits abuse in their community must pay. – Rappler.com

297,https://rappler.com/nation/extrajudicial-killing-victim-marikina-burial-community-braces-for-war,"As Marikina ‘EJK’ victim is buried, his community braces for war",," 
MANILA, Philippines – The victim rests, now the community fights back.
Kim Lester Ramos, the “extrajudicial killing” victim in Marikina, was laid to rest on Sunday, October 13. The black hearse carrying him was trailed by scores of people demanding justice for the boy they knew was taken too early and too violently.
Ramos had been shot behind the head by a policeman, identified as Police Corporal Herjonner Soller. According to the cop, Ramos fought to get his gun. As they grappled for the weapon, Soller ended  shooting the young man in the head. Ramos’ friend Lauro Lagarde, however, saw the cop shooting Kim point-blank, with all the intention to kill. (READ: Victim plays dead: In Marikina, a new case of ‘extrajudicial killing’)
Witnesses also saw Kim in the crime scene holding only his handkerchief. But when the police filed a complaint against Lagarde, they attached a grainy black-and-white photo of a hand still lightly squeezing a pistol. They said it was Ramos.
Ramos’ killing came as a shock to a community that has not reckoned with a drug operation killing in their homes. The government has counted at least 5,500 drug suspects killed since the campaign was declared by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 1, 2016. Human rights groups have counted over 20,000 killings from and inspired by the campaign.
Marikina was different, the residents of Mountain View Subdivision believed, until Ramos was killed that Saturday evening. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Father Flavie Villanueva said mass before the weeping crowd at the open court where Ramos’ wake had been—the very court where Ramos grew up playing basketball.
“All of us are shouting justice now. The Lord is also shouting. 'Justice!' One of his commandments is 'Do not kill.' We are with God in shouting 'Do not kill. Stop the killings’,” said Villanueva said in his homily.
Many of them hesitated to go. Just a day before, a police car passed by the wake without any officer speaking with them. While it was their first loss in the so-called drug war, they knew a threat when they saw it.

A boy named Kim
 
Kim Lester Ramos, 23, was a loving son and brother. He worked as a construction worker before he was killed. He dropped a post-high school vocational course so he could work with his parents in paying for the school bills of his 5 siblings.
“Ngayon lang po yang ganyan. Kahit po sa amin wala pong nakikita, ngayon lang po. Ito lang anak ko. Kung sino pa ang mabait doon sa sarili naming bayan, siya pa ang unang biniktima,” said Norman Ramos, Kim’s father.
(This is the first time this happened. We don’t see these cases in our area. It just happened now, with my son as victim. My son who is himself kind to the people of his town, was the first victim.)
He added: “Napakabait po ng anak ko. Matulungin sa amin. Maraming pangarap sa mga kapatid. Paano na niya po yun gagawin? (He was very kind. He was helpful. He had so many dreams for his siblings. How can he fulfil them now?)”
Kim Lester Ramos played basketball with many of the men of the subdivision. The neighbors remembered him for his jokes and his contagious laugh at their church community, the Christian Walk Ministry, where he threw a hand in organizing the last liga (basketball tournament). Among the participants were policemen. (LIST: Minors, college students killed in Duterte's drug war)
On Sunday, the residents of Mountain View donned white shirts printed with Kim's high school graduation photo. He wore a pristine toga and stared straight at the camera. The photo on the shirt is bordered by bold red capital letters: JUSTICE FOR KIM.
‘I am not alone’
JUSTICE DEMANDED. A black cloth with the call of Kim Lester Ramos' friends and family hangs over his grave at the Cainta Public Cemetery.

The battle would not come easy for the residents of Mountain View. The first, and so far last time, police officers were convicted of murder in a drug operation was in the case of Caloocan teen Kian delos Santos.
Kim Lester Ramos’ family and friends know this. They said they will not stop shouting for justice until the policeman is behind bars. After Kim’s bleach-white coffin was shut by cement in an elevated grave, his family and friends suspended tarpaulins calling for justice.
“Kaya kami lumalaban at suot namin ang t-shirt na ito, dahil naniniwala kami na malinis ang kanyang pagkatao (We are fighting and wearing these shirts because we believe that he is innocent),” said 24-year-old Abegail Garciano, an “Ate"" (big sister) to Kim.
Ramos’ alleged killer, Police Corporal Herjonner Soller, was an intelligence officer before he was placed on floating status over Ramos’ slay. The police have launched an internal investigation, complemented by a probe by the Commission on Human Rights.
Despite the questionable operation, police pursued a complaint against Ramos’ friend, Lauro Lagarde, also accusing him of snatching Soller’s gun and being a notorious robber. Barangay and National Bureau of Investigation clearances obtained by Ramos and Lagarde’s families prove otherwise. Both have no criminal record and have been certified to have been keeping “good conduct” as citizens.
Among the crowd at the funeral is a young man who was teased to look like a smaller version of Kim, complete with the bony frame and big shy eyes. John Martin Ramos, 22, willingly spoke to cameras. He has nothing to hide, he said. John Martin knew his cousin from the basketball court up to their home, where they conquered worlds in Mobile Legends. It was now a real-world battle for a beloved comrade.

""Ang marker na iyan ay nagsisilbing salamin sa nangyayari sa ating lipunan, nagsisilbing paalala na mayroong extrajudicial killings (EJKs), at ang batang ito ay namatay dahil sa EJK.""
(That marker serves to remember the kid. That marker serves to mirror what's happening in our society, a reminder that extrajudicial killings exist, and that Kian is a victim.)Apart from Delos Santos' death, the memorial marker notes that he was only one of 81 victims killed within 4 days from August 15-18, 2017, in Metro Manila. It also mentions the thousands who have been killed in the ongoing war on drugs. ""Nawa ang panandang ito ay magsilbing alaala sa mga buhay na pinaslang, mga asawang nabalo, at mga anak na naulila,"" the marker reads.  (May this marker serve as a reminder of the lives of those killed, their widows, and the children they left behind.)
Remembering the victimsAt the Mass after the marker was unveiled, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David also spoke about the thousands of slain victims. ""Woe to you who call addicts 'non-humans' deserving of death. Who gave you the right to pass judgment on people who are sick?"" David said. ""You claim to care about the future of young people in this country. What future awaits them if they end up dead on a street alley after a 'legitimate police operation'?""""Woe to you who claim to be waging a war against illegal drugs but are killing its victims instead of saving them! You who order law enforcers to murder when their mandate is to protect the citizens and defend their right to a safe and secure environment.""
""Woe to you who blindly follow unjust and unlawful orders! You who blindly obey the command to 'kill drug suspects if they resist arrest!' Woe to you who plant evidence in order to justify murder!""

The SWS survey, conducted December 16 to 19, 2018, noted that this number was ""up by 5 points from the 73% (from the survey conducted) in June 2017.""
The June 2017 survey showed 73% of Filipinos worried about EJKs. (READ: 7 in 10 Filipinos worried about selves, neighbors becoming EJK victims – SWS)
In the December 2018 survey, anxiety over EJKs was highest in Visayas (83%), with Metro Manila (79%), Mindanao (78%), and Balance Luzon (75%) following closely.
Despite the worry, though, more people in the December 2018 survey said the government was serious about solving the EJK problem at 71% or 7 out of 10 Filipinos, compared to June 2017 at 63%.
The SWS' December 2018 survey also found that the nation is split on who the EJKs target, with 50% saying only the poor are victimized and 48% saying the problem does not choose a class. Three percent say that only the rich are victimized.
Meanwhile, only 12% of Filipinos say that they know someone who was a victim of EJK. This number went down by 3 percentage points since the June 2017 survey.
Of those who knew a victim, most said that the victim was their acquiantance (8%), while less people said it was their neighbor (3%), relative (2%), best friend (2%), or officemate (2%). More of those who knew a victim came from urban areas (18%) than rural areas (12%).
The SWS survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews with 1,440 adults, aged 18 years and above. They spoke to 360 people each in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
They noted that there is a sampling error margin of ±2.6% for national percentages, and ±5% each for Balance Luzon, Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao.
SWS also noted that their survey was non-commissioned and the results were released as a public service. – Rappler.com"

This is shown by Philippine National Police (PNP) documents obtained by Rappler. In about two years – from July 1, 2016, up to June 11, 2018 – police have recorded 23,518 Homicide Cases Under Investigation (HCUI), equivalent to an average of 33 people killed a day.
HCUIs are murder and homicide cases combined, excluding killings by cops in police operations. Riding-in-tandem killings, being homicides and murders too, are included in this tally.
From July 1, 2016 to May 15, 2018, the government’s counting initiative #RealNumbersPH has tallied 4,279 suspects killed in anti-illegal drug operations, or an average of 6 a day.
The 4,279 are not included in HCUIs as they are presumed to have been carried out by cops in the line of duty.
The killings come as the Duterte administration continues to pursue an unrelenting campaign against drug suspects and criminals, with the President going on record on multiple occasions, encouraging law enforcers and Filipinos to harm and even kill delinquents.
A quick look at PNP data on Duterte’s first year in office shows that the campaign has resulted in a drop in all index crimes (or crimes against persons and property) – but not the killings.
All drug-related?
Not all of the 23,518 homicide cases under investigation fall under the government’s unrelenting anti-illegal drug campaign, the PNP claims.
As the PNP has repeatedly pointed out, the killings were not executed by state forces, but civilians. There are reports, however, accusing cops of going rogue and carrying out the killings themselves, if not supervising them.
The 23,518, according to the PNP, can also be further broken down into drug-related, non-drug related, and cases with motives still undetermined.
Rappler inputs the latest update on the figures in the graph below:
Of all the homicide cases under investigation, 11.34% were found to be drug-related, 45.55% non-drug-related, and 43.17% calling for a better scrutiny of motives.
According to PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management-Case Monitoring Division (DIDM-CMD) chief Senior Superintendent Ferdinand Bartolome, killings are classified by the PNP as drug-related if the victim or the killer are drug suspects, or if the motive for the killing is drug-related.
If the case does not have anything to do with drugs, it is classified as non-drug-related. Should further investigation reveal that a non-drug-related case turns out to have a drug angle later, the case’s count is transferred to drug-related cases.
In a majority of drug-related cases, Bartolome told Rappler, the killings were done to “prevent the victim from divulging detrimental information to the drug trade.”
On the other hand, the majority of the non-drug-related HCUIs were carried out due to a personal grudge, coming from “heated arguments and misunderstanding, personal gain, hatred, revenge, land dispute, love triangle, family feud, atrocities, lust, work-related, road rage, and others.”
Remember: EJK, DUI, HCUI, DPO
It took long for the PNP to settle with the term ""HCUI"" or homicide cases under investigation.
It can be traced all the way to the early months of the Duterte administration in 2016, when the number of vigilante-style killings soared with almost nightly riding-in-tandem shootings and dumping of corpses in canals and streets. Many bodies bore signs of torture before their final breaths, and were left with cartons labeling them as drug suspects.
These were matched by the rising numbers of killings in police operations because of suspects allegedly fighting back (""nanlaban"").
Given these circumstances, human rights advocates and critics alleged the existence of extrajudicial killings or EJKs, referring to those killed in the streets and those killed by cops during anti-drug operations. The term easily became part of the public lingo, inviting scrutiny of the PNP.
In response, the government created the term deaths under investigation (DUI), intended to distinguish killings that were committed outside the government's campaign from those that were part of police operations. It has the same definition as today's HCUI: murder and homicide cases combined, excluding killings by cops in police operations.
EJKs? A dead body with a sign board lays on the road in Tondo, Manila on July 28, 2016.
File photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler
The PNP regularly released the number of DUIs, just to show that they were keeping a record of the deaths and that most were not drug-related.
The killings that happened under police operations, on the other hand, were said to involve suspects who ""died during police operations"" or simply ""DPO"". They died because they allegedly resisted searches or arrests. While all were presumed to be regular by the PNP, allegations persist that DPOs are the same as EJKs.
Reports have accused cops of mercilessly gunning down defenseless drug suspects then planting evidence to make it appear that the accused put up a fight. Things came to a head with the explosive case of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos.
Based on Rappler’s timeline, the PNP tried to discreetly introduce the term ""HCUI"" in March 2017. 
Why the change? According to the PNP’s Bartolome, they simply didn’t want to confuse the international community.
“Because abroad, DUI meant driving under the influence [of alcohol],” he told Rappler. Without a formal announcement about the shift, some media outlets continue to use the popular term DUI.
Whatever label the government uses to distinguish deaths, however, the killings continue to rise.
Troubled regions
Below is a chart showing the total number of killings per region and how efficient they are at solving them:
The country’s two most developed regions, Metro Manila and Calabarzon, are where almost a third of the killings happen. Metro Manila accounts for 18.06% while Calabarzon accounts for 13.25% of all HCUIs.
The northern Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and Mimaropa, meanwhile, have recorded the least HCUIs with 271 and 432, respectively.
Of the 23,518 killings, 12,470 have either been cleared or solved. This gives the PNP a crime solution efficiency rate of 53.02% for HCUIs.
HCUIs: An accomplishment?
Are killings something to be proud of?
When Malacañang recorded HCUIs as an accomplishment of the Duterte administration’s anti-drug campaign in its 2017 yearend report, it raised a lot of brows.
The report was prepared by the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), which also manages the government’s #RealNumbersPH initiative.
The HCUI numbers were placed in the summary, despite the PNP already clarifying back in August 2016 that not all of them can be linked to the government’s anti-illegal drugs campaign.
Shown a #RealNumbersPH card which included HCUIs as achievements, PNP DIDM chief Director Elmo Sarona said the PNP had never considered the numbers as accomplishments.
 
The two-star general surmised that the number was added to show that the government was being transparent, and is exhausting all efforts to lower the number.
But, the report did not break down the number into how many of the cases were already solved. It just announced thousands of deaths, complete with an icon of a dead man with blood streaming from his body. (READ: A look at the state of crime, drugs in the Philippines)
Is it a communications mishap? The PNP doesn’t think so, given that their officials meet with PCOO officers monthly to update the numbers. Rappler has reached out to PCOO Assistant Secretary Queenie Rodulfo for the Palace’s reason for including HCUIs in its accomplishment report.
In stopping the numbers from rising, the PNP continues to move with the mentality that bringing down illegal drugs will also bring down crime. As records have already shown, the strategy appears to be working for all crimes, except for the gravest one: killings.
The PNP now faces the challenge of bringing down the number of killings, an achievement that it has yet to be proud of. – Rappler.com

The December 2019 survey results released late Sunday, January 12, showed that 33% of Filipinos said that the abuses are “very many” while 42% said “somewhat many” – totaling 76% for “many.""
The respondents were asked: “In the course of the administration’s war on illegal drugs, would you say that the number of abuses of human rights, for example the Extrajudicial Killings or EJKs, has been… (Very many, Somewhat many, Only a few, or Very few)?”
At least 24% said there were few – 21% only a few and 3% very few.
According to SWS, the survey was conducted from December 13 to 16, 2019 via face-to-face interviews among 1,200 people equally distributed across 4 geographic areas. The margin of error was ±3% for national and ±6% each for Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
Duterte’s drug war has been heavily criticized for the high number of killings. Data shows that more than 6,000 people have been killed in anti-drug operations by police alone, while human rights groups estimate there may be as many as 27,000 deaths, including victims of vigilante-style killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
The situation in the Philippines tagged by groups as a “human rights crisis” has been at the center of attention of many international groups, including the United Nations.
The UN Human Rights Council in July 2019 adopted a resolution which, among others, asked UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to write a comprehensive report on the situation in the Philippines and present it to the council. 
The December 2019 SWS survey also found that more than half of Filipinos back this action.
Results show that at least 56% of respondents agreed with the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)’s resolution calling for an investigation into the extrajudicial killings related to the drug war. Results also indicated that 20% disagreed while 24% remain undecided.
The figures showed a very strong net agreement of +36.
How the Duterte administration responded: In a statement on Monday, January 13, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo brushed aside the fact a big majority of Filipinos saw many human rights abuses and instead played up the SWS' findings that 73% of Filipinos said the present number of users of illegal drugs has ""fallen"" since Duterte took office in 2016.Panelo maintained a false narrative that human rights abuses and drug-related killings in Duterte's landmark anti-illegal drug campaign were a result of victims ""fighting back"" against police. (A Rappler investigation has found strong indications that the police were outsourcing extrajudicial killings. Several victim testimonies also debunk claims they ""fought"" against police.)Panelo said the Duterte administration was ""determined to punish to the fullest state agents who abuse their authority,"" as he welcomed victims and witnesses of human rights abuses to file cases with the government.""As the President says, as against them, there will be hell to pay. We encourage those who are victims of - or who are witnesses to - these abuses to come forward and file complaints so that justice will be served,"" he said.Killings which are being criminally investigated have not shown promising results, with the thousands going unsolved as of 2019.  (READ: Duterte gov't allows 'drug war' deaths to go unsolved)
On January 7, SWS also released survey results which showed that 78% of Filipinos believe the Philippine National Police (PNP) has ""ninja cops"" or cops who sell drugs they seize in operations.
SWS said that the items on people’s opinion about the war on drugs are non-commissioned and are done on its “own initiative and released as a public service.” – with a report from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com

Up to 500 people, most of them students of Adamson University, came to hear Mass on Monday, July 25, when Duterte addressed both houses of Congress for the first time.
Presided over by Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo, the Mass marked the launch of the ""Huwag Kang Papatay"" (Thou Shall Not Kill) campaign initiated by the Archdiocese of Manila.
This is the first major movement of Catholics in the Archdiocese of Manila against recent extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.
The killings come as Duterte wages a bloody war against illegal drugs. This war has killed at least 300 people – a figure that includes those slain in legitimate police operations and those who died through extrajudicial means. 
In his homily on Monday, Pabillo condemned extrajudicial killings in the war against illegal drugs, saying crime cannot stop crime.
Fr Atilano Fajardo, minister of public affairs of the Manila Archdiocese, described targets of summary killing as ""sacrificial victims"" whose deaths will make the anti-drug war seem like a success.
'Suspects only'
The Mass for these victims on Monday was ""very solemn"" and ""very profound"", Focolare Movement member Grace Ceniza said. 
""Prayer is very powerful,"" Ceniza said. ""In the Mass, we unite our prayer to Jesus. It is Jesus who is praying, not only us.""
Adamson University student council official Keith Baluyut, for his part, said students are one with the victims of extrajudicial killings.
""Walang sinumang puwedeng kumuha ng buhay natin kung hindi ang Diyos lamang. 'Wag tayong matakot ipaglaban ng ating karapatan,"" Baluyut said. (There is no one who can get our lives besides God. Let us not be afraid to fight for our rights.)

The Palace assured the public on Monday that law-abidizing citizens have nothing to fear from government.
""We recognize our people’s concern as we assure them that the government’s anti-drug operations are not aimed at poor, innocent, hapless individuals,"" said Communications Secretary Martin Andanar in a press statement.
He emphasized that police follow the procedures during anti-drug operations.
""What our authorities are conducting are legitimate police operations that require observance of operational protocols.  Police authorities who violate procedures are made to answer before the law,"" said Andanar.
Since the start of Duterte's term, 6,065 people have been killed in drug-related incidents as of early December 2016. Of this number, 2,102 were killed in police operations as of December 14 while 3,933 were victims of extrajudicial killings.
Duterte has insisted the extrajudicial killings are not the work of government but by drug personalities and other criminals.
But human rights activists and his critics have said his colorful threats against drug suspects may be creating a culture of impunity that encourages the killings, whether or not state-sponsored.
The PNP, however, insists they conduct anti-drug operations properly and only shoot when suspects resist arrest. (READ: Dela Rosa to Senate: We are not butchers)

MANILA, Philippines – As he opened Mindanao's largest drug rehabilitation center, President Rodrigo Duterte said he has asked God to make sure victims of extrajudicial killings (EJKs) go to heaven.
""You enjoy your human rights there in heaven kasi (because) God promised you that victims of EJKs go to heaven. 'Yan ang sabi ko sa Diyos (that's what I told God),"" he said on Friday, August 3.
He was giving a speech after unveiling the marker for the P500-million Northern Mindanao Wellness and Reintegration Center donated by a group of Chinese businessmen. The center is touted as proof that his administration is serious about rehabilitating drug addicts.
Duterte then relayed his supposed conversation with God, where his request was granted. 
""Sabi naman ng Diyos, 'Puwede, puwede.' Gagawin ko ba naman 'yan kung walang guarantee? Kasi kaawa naman. Nagdrodroga ka, impiyerno ka. God, pagbigyan mo na lang 'yan,"" said the Philippine President.
(God said, 'Okay, okay.' Will I do that if there is no guarantee? Because they are pitiful. You take drugs, you go to hell. God, just give them a break.)
Duterte then claimed he made another personal special request to God. ""Reserve the hottest place in hell for me and may I burn till eternity,"" he said.
The President, leader of a predominantly Catholic nation, then again called the God of his critics ""stupid.""

MANILA, Philippines – The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has been haunted by issues related to his intense anti-illegal drug campaign.
An “unprecedented” rise in the number of deaths in both police operations and vigilante-style killings was observed since the bloody war on drugs was launched in July 2016.
As of April 23 this year, 2,717 suspected drug personalities have been killed in legitimate police operations since the start of the Duterte administration, according to data from the Philippine National Police (PNP). There are, however, 3,603 deaths that still remain under investigation. (READ: IN NUMBERS: Philippines' 'war on drugs’)
The alleged extrajudicial killings that happened in a span of less than a year bore similarities to each other. The narration of witnesses of killings were all too familiar.  
Were there observable common patterns in the reported extrajudicial killings? Here’s what Rappler found out:
Suspected drug personalities whose lifeless and wrapped bodies end up on the streets were abducted beforehand, according to witnesses. More often than not, the abductors were armed men wearing masks.  
Usually, the victims were at their most vulnerable during the time of abduction: either working or at home with their families.
This is what happened to Heart de Chavez in January 2017. Her family narrated that they were all asleep when big burly men wearing masks barged into their home and dragged Heart out. They found her lifeless body with a bullet in her cheek inside an empty house not far from their own.
It was what happened to 22-year-old Rowena Tiamson who never went home after going out to enroll for her last semester in college. 
 
Rowena’s body was found on July 19, 2016 hands tied and face wrapped in packing tape. Around her neck was a cardboard sign with the all-too-familiar phrase, “Huwag tularan, pusher (Don’t emulate me. I’m a pusher).” Her family insisted she never used drugs. 
 The state Rowena was discovered after being abducted was replicated so many times in the last 9 months. 
Suspected drug personalities were reported missing and their bodies were later found with their heads wrapped in packing tape and hands tied with a cord. 
How does the public know it’s drug-related? Through a cardboard bearing the words, “drug pusher ako, huwag tularan (I’m a drug pusher, don’t emulate me).” 
There were cases when packets of shabu were found inside the pockets of the victims. 
People who were suspected of doing or peddling illegal drugs were also killed on the spot.  
According to witnesses’ accounts, perpetrators were often armed men wearing civilian clothes. They barged into the victims’ houses and emptied their magazines on them. Sometimes, they dragged them out to narrow alleys. 
On October 31, 2016, 5 suspected drug personalities were massacred in Barangay Addition Hills in Mandaluyong City. The killers were 6 armed men who wore helmets to cover their faces. (READ: Impunity: A Halloween massacre)  
One witness in the Addition Hills massacre narrated that she heard the victims begging the killers to stop. She heard one of them, a woman, cry out that she would surrender. 
It’s the same narrative from several other witnesses. They insisted that the victims wailed and begged the perpetrators to stop, only to be ignored. They also insisted that their son, brother, husband, or friend did not do anything wrong and begged to just be arrested, and not killed on the spot. 
There were cases where the families themselves were assaulted.  
It was what happened to Nenita Sumilang, mother of 18-year-old Joshua who was dragged out of their house by armed men. She said that a Tondo policeman named Ronald Alvarez aimed a gun at her as she begged them to just jail her son.  
In a separate incident in Tondo, Rowena Appari passed out after being hit and kicked by one of the 5 armed men who barged into their home and eventually killed her son Rex while his girlfriend, Lori Ann, and their 10-month-old son knelt and cried in an alley near their house. 
But these pleas often fell on deaf ears. 
Suspected drug personalities were killed by gun shots, usually to the head, as their families wailed nearby.  
Their lifeless, bloodied bodies lay slumped as the killers left the scene. In several cases, families and investigators recovered packets of shabu and a rusty gun sans a serial number (often .38 caliber) near the body.  
The presence of these elements in the crime scene – a gun and illegal drugs – supported the claim that the victims fought back or that they were indeed drug addicts. 
There were also cases when victims were killed by armed men aboard a motorcycle. Sometimes, after gunning down their targets, the killers threw a piece of paper identifying the victim as a drug pusher.
This was what happened to 21-year-old Jerico Camitan and 17-year-old Erica Fernandez who were both killed by gunmen on a motorycle in Quezon City in October 2016, according to witnesses. Near Jerico’s body was a cardboard that said “Tulak ka, hayop ka (You’re a pusher, you are an animal)!”
It was the same thing that happened to Roman Clifford “Oman” Manaois in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. A witness recalled that after his companion was shot, 20-year-old Oman held up his hands, seemingly asking for mercy, when the gunmen wearing bonnets turned and killed him. (READ: Drug user? No, Oman was a good son)
Concern over drug war
Amid the rise in the number of killings and the similarities among them, Duterte allies are quick to dismiss criticisms aimed at the administration's war on drugs. Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, in fact, insisted before the United Nations on May 8, 2017 that there is no new wave of killings in the Philippines. (READ: Cayetano to UN: No new wave of killings in PH)
The denial, however, did not deter at least 45 UN member-countries from expressing concern over the human rights situation in the country. During the Universal Periodic Review, the Philippine government was asked to investigate and put an end to the extrajudicial killings in the war on drugs.  (READ: Countries call for end to killings in PH drug war)
The constant denial of the government has not halted the killings. Members of the local media, especially journalists assigned to the night beat, continue to document every bloody incident involving suspected drug personalities and the police. Bodies are still being left behind by alleged vigilantes in dark alleys. – Rappler.com

Nowadays we have that ubiquitous cardboard saying “Drug pusher, huwag tularan.” Like the activists during Arroyo’s time, suspected drug users and dealers are subject to public villification through “Oplan Tokhang.” They are forced into surrendering and admitting guilt on the basis of a nebulous list drawn up by the police and barangay officials. In fact, many of those who surrendered have succumbed to vigilante killings. Police say the killings are part of the drug syndicates’ effort to cleanse its ranks.
Alleged criminals killed in police operations are another disturbing matter. The rise in incidents of drug suspects reportedly killed while trying to resist arrest are too dramatic to be given a presumption of regularity. A number have telltale signs of a rubout as acknowledged by the police themselves.
What makes today’s EJKs particularly complicated is that the victims are considered undesirable members of society. Unlike activists or revolutionaries, drug addicts and pushers have no redeeming quality. These are not idealists being killed for exercising their constitutional rights or addressing legitimate social grievances. Druggies, for most people, are the scum of the earth that should be wiped out from existence.
Notice that when activists or rebels are summarily executed, their families and the communities that they have served immediately demand justice. Human rights groups, whose orientation has traditionally been, and for good reason, to protect the rights of political dissenters immediately investigate and act to prevent more killings. Networks of organizations are easily formed to hold the perpetrators to account.
On the other hand, when drug dealers are killed, their families hang their heads in shame and the community silently rejoices at the loss of another troublemaker. Everything is accepted as a consequence of the victims’ alleged illegal activities.
The challenges
If we are to stop the killings, the first challenge is for the public to denounce it. Like in so many issues, public opposition, or better yet outrage, is needed for the government to change its policy.
Unfortunately, whenever people are painted as rebels, terrorists or criminals, it becomes difficult to denounce their killing. The initial indifference when activists started getting killed during the Arroyo regime is similar to today’s ambivalence in the face of the killings of suspected drug addicts and pushers. Oftentimes it is only when the obviously innocent are killed – like children and nursing mothers – that the public is moved to denounce EJKs.
Denouncing the killings should not mean condoning the alleged illegal activities of its victims. What it should translate to is a demand for the police and military to follow the law and respect due process and human rights, so that criminals can be properly punished in accordance with what is in the law.
The second challenge is for the families and friends of the victims of EJKs to stand up and demand for justice. It is understandable that many of them would rather sweep the killings under the rug, considering the stigma of being linked to suspected drug criminals. However, it would be difficult for government agencies like the Commission on Human Rights, National Police Commission, Department of Justice, or human rights organizations and civil society organizations, to be taking up the cudgels for people who do not want to be helped in the first place.
The third challenge is for human rights groups to expand their advocacy to include those whose rights are violated on the basis of purely criminal, non-political offences. While the traditional political orientation of human rights advocacy is as important as ever, urgent attention is needed for atrocities committed in the course of Duterte’s war on drugs and other anti-crime campaigns. Such a challenge will not be easy, considering that most human rights groups are already so stretched in terms of resources and manpower in dealing with political and counter-insurgency related human rights violations.
Because the use of EJKs is an unwritten state policy in the Philippines, the only way to prevent it is for the people themselves to demand a stop to the practice. – Rappler.com

This, said Roque, is the ""hypocrisy"" underlying the statements of De Lima and Gascon, critics of President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war.
The spokesman's statement Monday, December 11, read: ""How is it now that when drug pushers or users die, Senator De Lima and Chairman Gascon insist that these are EJKs? Their sudden about-face is baffling given that these drug pushers and users are not members or affiliated with any political, environmental, agrarian, or labor organization. These drug pushers or users are likewise not journalists.""
De Lima, as justice secretary under the Aquino administration, had signed the operational guidelines for implementing Administrative Order No 35 which gave a definition of extrajudicial killings that excludes the killing of drug personalities.
For the CHR, it was its former chairperson Loretta Rosales who served as ""observer"" when the document was signed, not Gascon.
The guidelines defined extrajudicial killings (EJK) as killings in which the victim is a member or affiliate of an organization, including those with political, environmental, agrarian, labor, or similar causes; or is an advocate of such causes. The victim can also be a media practitioner.
An EJK victim, according to the document, may also be someone ""apparently mistaken or identified"" to be any of the above.
That De Lima and Gascon are not adhering to the AO's definition of EJK exposes the politicized nature of their criticisms against Duterte's drug war, said Roque.
""If the two believed then that the AO they adopted was correct and in accordance with the law, they should be the first to defend the Duterte administration’s campaign against illegal drugs because the AO No. 35 signed by former President Benigno Aquino III is correct,"" said Duterte's spokesman.
However, if the two vocal critics do not agree with the definition made by Aquino's AO, they should ""admit to the nation and to the world that what they did...was wrong and that Aquino only signed AO No. 35 so that his administration would not be blamed for the deaths of drug pushers and users during his presidency,"" he said.
""It is high time that the hypocrisies of Senator De Lima and Chairman Gascon are exposed in favor of the truth.  The Filipino people deserve no less,"" said the Palace spokesman.
The CHR had previously assailed the use of the AO's definition for extrajudicial killings, saying it is ""limiting"" and discounts other killings perpetrated by state agents and non-state actors.
This was after the Philippine National Police used the AO definition as basis for saying there have been zero cases of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration.
The commission sticks to the definition provided by former United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston – that the term extrajudicial killing refers to ""any killing by government forces as well as killings by any other groups or individuals which the government fails to investigate, prosecute, and punish when it is in a position to do so."" – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippine – President Rodrigo Duterte has broken his promise to help the country’s marginalized sector by targeting poor Filipinos in his war on drugs, a human rights group said.
In its latest report, the Philippine Human Rights Information Center (PhilRights), called Duterte’s anti-illegal drugs campaign a war on the poor as victims are often  from low-income communities. 
The effect goes beyond death, said PhilRights Executive Director Nymia Simbulan, as the campaign has pushed victims' families into severe poverty. For every death in the drug war, a family is left behind. 
“Isang kahig, isang tuka ang mga pamilya ng mga biktima,” she said on Wednesday, September 19. “Mas lalo pa itong lumala nang napatay ang primary breadwinner ng pamilya.”
(These families have a hand-to-mouth existence. It became much worse when their primary breadwinner was killed.) 
In its analysis and documentation of at least 58 extrajudicial killing cases referred to PhiRights by families themselves, the group found that the victims were “male adults within productive age range, primary breadwinners, low- or irregular-wage earners, of low educational attainment, and residents of urban poor communities.”
“Ang mga babae ang sumasalo sa mga responsibilidad na naiwan ng asawa nilang napatay (The women take over the responsibilities left by their husbands killed in the drug war). They carry the burden of working and being a single parent,"" Simbulan said.
Immediate support needed
Members of these families, especially children, face trauma and stigmatization that can haunt them their whole lives. 
Simbulan said these families need immediate livelihood aid, as well as medical assistance and emotional support.  
“Marami dito (A lot of them) do not have high educational background so you can expect that they will end up with jobs in the informal economy, low income and irregular jobs. For families with an average...of two to 3 children, that is not enough,"" she said.
The anti-drug campaign has claimed 4,500 lives in police operations alone. Human rights groups, meanwhile, estimate the number to reach more than 20,000, to include victims of vigilante killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Duterte and his allies, however, have continuously dismissed criticisms from both local and international human rights groups. The government has also refused to heed efforts for investigations into the systematic killings. (READ: Climate of fear: Justice remain elusive 2 years into Duterte's drug war)
“Hindi normal sa kahit sinong tao ang matuwa kapag may namatay (It's not normal for anyone to be happy if someone dies) especially if there's no concrete evidence that that person committed a crime,” said Virginia Suarez, PhilRights Board of Trustees director.
“We refuse to see them as simply numbers even if the government only sees them as such because to us, they are human beings with faces and families,” she added. – Rappler.com

As of January 2017, over 2,500 suspected drug personalities have been killed in police operations alone.
One issue that has generated a lot of debate in the death count related to the war on drugs is how to interpret the numbers that the Philippine National Police (PNP) has tagged as ""deaths under investigation"" (DUI).
The police had never used the term ""deaths under investigation"" until after the Duterte administration assumed office. Reporters who have been covering the beat for a long time will also confirm that this had never been used in police statements and releases. Even Google search results yield negative results on the use of this term by authorities before August 2016. 
Reporters covering the police beat started reporting more frequently in the first few months of the anti-illegal drug campaign about people found dead in the streets, some appearing to have been killed vigilante-style. Some of the early corpses were shown bound in packing tape with cardboard signs labelling them as drug pushers.
To illustrate how the use of the term DUI has muddled the issue of the death count, we timeline events that led to the use of the term, as well as how the PNP's description of it evolved. 
The highlights of this timeline reveal the following:
July 7, 2016
The Philippine Daily Inquirer published its ""Kill List,"" which tracks killings related to the anti-drug war monitored by its reporters. The list includes vigilante-style killings and individuals killed as a result of police operations.
July 13, 2016
ABS-CBN published its MAP, CHARTS: The Death Toll of the War on Drugs.
August 2, 2016
Senator Leila de Lima, who then chaired the Senate committee on justice, delivered a privilege speech about the killings which triggered a Senate investigation on the issue. 
August 6, 2016
Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno ordered PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa to probe alleged extrajudicial killings (EJK) both in police operations and in reported vigilante-style deaths. 
August 15, 2016
Senator Panfilo Lacson cited PNP statistics saying there had been 681 ""vigilante killings"" or those that happened outside legitimate police operations from July 1 to August 3. Lacson noted that this number is higher than the 612 drug suspects killed in police operations from July 1 to August 15. Lacson admonished the PNP to stop the vigilante killings.
August 18, 2016
Dela Rosa used the term ""deaths under investigation"" (DUI) for the first time in a hearing by the Senate committee on public order regarding possible revisions to laws that would help anti-illegal drug efforts.
The PNP chief said there were 899 deaths falling under this category from July 1 to August 15. Among these, 22 cases were filed in court. These DUIs, added Dela Rosa, took place outside legitimate police operations.
In a press briefing after the hearing, Dela Rosa further described the term DUI.
""Those are the dead who were just found floating along canals, the dead who were dumped along roads with their hands tied and their faces, eyes, and mouths taped. Also those killed by riding-in-tandem, or those who were just shot. Those are the deaths under investigation,"" Dela Rosa said.
August 23, 2016
In a Senate hearing on reported EJKs, Dela Rosa said not all DUIs are drug-related. He also said motives in at least 757 deaths at the time had yet to be determined.
September 2016
The PNP Public Information Office (PIO) started sending DUI statistics to PNP beat reporters, along with numbers for Project Double Barrel and Oplan TokHang.
The DUI statistics just listed one figure for the total number of victims. It also gave the total number of cases or incidents, distinguished between those currently being investigated (DUI) and those with investigation concluded (IC) or cases filed in court.
September 13, 2016
Rappler published its ""In Numbers"" story, tracking the number of deaths or victims linked to the ""war on drugs"", based on data sent by the PNP to reporters.
There was no breakdown for the motives of these DUIs, whether drug-related or not, because these were not reflected in the data given to reporters. This continued until the suspension of Project Double Barrel in January 2017.
September 15, 2016
In the PNP PIO's DUI data update, it added this note: ""DUIs are not automatically extrajudicial killings nor vigilante/summary killings. DUIs are murder and/or homicide [cases] that are still under investigation.""
September 19, 2016
The PNP sent a letter to Rappler, saying that cases of DUIs ""cannot all be attributed to the 'war on drugs', unless it is determined as such through proper investigation.""
October 10, 2016
Police Superintendent Henry Libay, head secretariat of PNP's Task Force Usig explained, ""Out of 1,866 deaths under investigation, only 685 are drug-related."" Libay mentioned other motives like personal grudge and robbery or theft, but did not provide a breakdown.
October 28, 2016
The PNP replied to a Rappler researcher, denying a request for specific details of those killed during legitimate and outside police operations ""because it may compromise our ongoing investigations, operations and other related activities in relation to Project Double Barrel.""
November 25, 2016
The administration launched its eFOI portal. A number of individuals filed requests for progress on ""deaths under investigation."" 
December 8, 2016
PNP chief Dela Rosa told reporters that only a third of over 3,000 DUI cases at that point were drug-related. The rest ""are normal cases of murder, homicide, [those killed by riding-in-tandem suspects], parricide.""
Dela Rosa also used different criteria in classifying a death as DUI. 
""Na-validate na talagang hindi ka involved sa drugs pero namatay ka, death under investigation dahil unknown ‘yung killer, assailant mo. Lumabas ngayon na hindi ka pala drug-related.""
(For example, it was validated that you were not really involved in drugs, but you died, so that's death under investigation because your killer or assailant was unknown. It appeared now that your death wasn't drug-related.)
He likewise claimed some of the deaths were caused by guns-for-hire taking advantage of the anti-illegal drug campaign.
January 2, 2017
In a document showing a recapitulation (summary) of the DUI figures, the PNP defined DUI as ""murder cases outside police operations, regardless of the motive which [has] yet to be cleared or solved.""
January 9, 2017
The PNP PIO gave the last update on DUI to police beat reporters.
It showed that there were 3,603 victims in 3,271 cases or incidents of DUIs. There were also 922 victims in 875 cases with investigation concluded and filed in court. There is no breakdown as to how many victims died in drug-related and non-drug-related incidents.
Statistics on DUIs and cases with investigation concluded as of January 9, 2017.
Below is a graph of DUI figures received from the PNP PIO from September 2016 to January 2017.
After the suspension of Project Double Barrel Alpha on January 30, the PNP did not release a document showing breakdowns for DUI and IC [investigation concluded] figures, at least in terms of motives, to PNP beat reporters. 
They only mentioned these breakdowns in press briefings and statements.
February 1, 2017
The PNP reacted via a statement to an Amnesty International report, which detailed stories of alleged police corruption and abuse in the war on drugs:
""... [O]f the 4,744 murders under investigation that both local and foreign observers wrongfully refer to as 'extrajudicial killing', 3,459 were determined to be non-drug related incidents, 662 of which were motivated by personal grudge, 15 were related to property dispute, 16 were crimes of passion, 10 were 'rido' or family feud, 11 were work-related, and 2 were atrocities committed by threat groups.""
Notice, however, that the breakdown of non-drug-related incidents only add up to 716, leaving 2,743 deaths unaccounted for. 
""On the other hand, only 1,285 incidents had something to do with the victim's association with drug activities,"" the PNP's statement said. 
March 15, 2017
PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos disputed Vice President Robredo's use of the 7,080 figure. He said, out of over 4,000 DUIs, only 682 cases were found to be drug-related. The rest ""are regular crimes happening on the street.""
Curiously, the number of drug-related cases appears to have ""decreased"", from 1,285 in its statement in response to the Amnesty International report.
March 23, 2017
A document obtained upon request by Rappler shows an updated summary of the figures.
In the summary, the PNP once again changed the way they described the deaths. The document now refers to DUIs as ""homicide cases under investigation"" (HCUI) and IC as ""filed in court"" (FC).
From July 1, 2016 to March 21, 2017, there were 1,370 incidents with drug-related motives and 894 non-drug-related ones. 
The PNP also said there are 3,560 incidents with ""motive to be determined.""
The data appears to have included statistics for Project Double Barrel Reloaded.
Statistics as of March 21, 2017, provided by the PNP upon request, on DUI cases, which are now referred to as homicide cases under investigation.
'
Note that the PNP released a breakdown only for incidents in terms of drug-related and non-drug-related ones.
Some incidents documented in the previous months resulted in multiple victims.
The breakdown given for victims was not according to motive, but according to whether the cases were ""cleared"" (suspect was identified and charged in court) or ""not cleared."" 
As for 1,433 cases/incidents filed in court, 105 were found to be drug-related (42 with suspects arrested, plus 63 at-large), and 1,328 were not (803 with suspects arrested plus 525 at-large).
On March 23, Rappler requested for a breakdown of the number of victims in DUI/HCUI and IC/FC cases by motive. 
In its response on March 27, however, the PNP only released statistics similar to the one shown above, with no breakdown of victims by motive.
The document also does not isolate the numbers recorded between July 1, 2016 and January 31, 2017 – or during the first round of PNP's anti-illegal drugs campaign – as requested by Rappler. This mixes up categories used in a previous data set with a newer data set released this March, creating even more confusion in the interpretation of the data. – with Michael Bueza, Bea Cupin, Gemma Mendoza and Wayne Manuel/Rappler.com"

De Lima said this on Tuesday, February 14, as some of her supporters from the Every Woman group went to her office ahead of her supposed impending arrest.
""Sakali lang po mangyari na, God forbid, sana ilagay naman ako sa isang lugar na safe and secure ako. Kasi marami na hong nangyayari 'di ba, pinapapatay sa loob ng selda, so what is another EJK?"" De Lima said.
(If ever it happens, God forbid, I hope they put me in a place that is safe and secure. Because there are many things happening, many people are killed inside prison. So what is another EJK?)
De Lima is the staunchest critic of President Rodrigo Duterte and his deadly war on drugs. She drew the ire of the President anew when she initiated a Senate probe into the spate of extrajudicial killings under his administration. Duterte, in turn, went all out against the senator, accusing her of being a drug coddler and vowing she would be jailed.
De Lima, however, has no ""safe"" location in mind yet. The senator said she is not requesting any special treatment, as she just wants to be secure wherever she will be detained, citing the case of former Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr who was killed inside prison.
""Pinagiisipan pa saan 'yung safe. I don't think I would be safe in a regular jail facility. I'm not asking [for] any special or VIP treatment. Basta ba siguraduhin lang nila na it's a safe and secure area,"" De Lima said.
(We are still thinking where I'll be safe. I don't think I would be safe in a regular jail facility. I'm not asking for any special or VIP treatment. They better make sure that it's a safe and secure area.)
Asked where possible threats could come from, she said: ""It can be from anywhere. Kasi parati naman akong may threats. 'Yung kay Mayor Espinosa, 'yung mga wala pa ring katapusan [na patayan] (Because I'm always receiving threats. The case of Mayor Espinosa, the endless extrajudicial killings), and I'm being tagged as Bilibid drug trade queen, tagged as public enemy number one of Solicitor General [Jose] Calida, so you can never tell if there are groups interested in eliminating me.""
Despite such fears, De Lima said she would not resist arrest.
""Wala naman akong magagawa (I cannot do anything), I am morally and psychologically resisting it, because I'm innocent. But physically, I cannot resist,"" the senator said.
""'Di po ako tatakas, 'di po ako magtatago, 'di po ako pupunta ng ospital, 'di po ako mag-wi-wheelchair o mag-ne-neck brace. Wala po akong gagawin na gano'ng istilo,"" De Lima said, referring to the common ""style"" of politicians who are facing charges.
(I will not escape, hide, or go to a hospital. I will not be in a wheelchair or wear a neck brace. I will not resort to such tactics.)
She then jokingly told her supporters: ""Puwede 'nyo po ako samahan sa loob ng presinto at magbantay sa labas. Pero 'wag na sa kulungan. Bisitahin 'nyo na lang po ako."" (You can join me inside the detention facility and just stand guard outside my cell. But not inside my cell. Just visit me.)
The supporters present included former Social Welfare secretary Corazon Soliman, former Peace Process adviser Teresita Deles, former Commission on Human Rights chairperson Etta Rosales, and former Civil Service Commission chairperson Karina David, among others. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – Death came two days after a family in Buenavista village in the central Philippine city of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, celebrated Christmas.
It was 7 am, December 27, 2018, when 3 armed men barged into the house and told them to get out. 
Cedine Isugan, 28, was in the kitchen, preparing the day’s first meal. Jesus, her husband, was carrying their 7-month-old son. She was ordered to take the baby from him while he was forced to lie face down at gunpoint. Confused about what was happening, she asked the men, ""why us?"" They didn't bother to reply.
“There were dozens of them surrounding the village – all armed and masked. We could only see the print on their shirts that says ‘Police,’” she said. 
The armed men dragged Jesus to the backyard while the others talked to the villagers, mostly women and children, who were gathered outside. 
“I heard 3 gunshots,” she said. Cedine knew that moment that her husband was in danger, but she was prevented from taking a closer look. 
There was a sudden uncontrollable fear in Cedine, and when she was finally allowed to get near her husband, she saw his blood flowing on the barren land. She hesitated to touch his lifeless body – until their two-year-old daughter walked toward her father and innocently tried to wake him up. 
“I can’t believe it. It was nothing to them. It was like killing a pig or a stray dog to them,” she said.
“He should’ve not come home,” Cedine said of Jesus. 
Second attack
The Isugan home was filled with excitement when Jesus came home for a vacation on December 24, 2018. The next day was a big celebration for the family because it was Jesus’ birthday, which coincided with the Christian observance of Jesus Christ’s birth.   
Jesus, a 27-year-old son of a farmer, had worked as a construction laborer in Cebu City for 4 months before he was killed.  
The attack against the Isugan family did not end with the death of Jesus. A few weeks ago, their house was burnt down by unidentified assailants.  
“They are really angry with us. I think it is because of our family’s involvement in the peasant organization,” said Cedine.  
Her parents-in-law are active members of the peasant organization in Negros Oriental that helps farmers with land disputes and unfair labor practices.  
Spate of killings 
A total of 6 people, including Jesus, were killed that day in December. Their bodies were put in a sack and paraded in front of a police headquarters in Negros.  
It was a joint operation of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police,  called “Oplan Sauron,” against suspected communist rebels, criminals, and those involved in illegal drugs. 
According to the police report, some 26 suspects, including 53-year-old Delia Isuga, Jesus’ mother, were arrested. At least 61 firearms, 12 explosives, and hundreds of ammunition were seized. Six people “resisted arrest” and were killed after they “engaged in a shootout” with the law enforcers.
Oplan Sauron was a response of the state forces to President Rodrigo Duterte’s Memorandum Order No. 32, which he signed on November 22, 2018. The order aimed to “suppress lawless violence” in the provinces in Negros, Samar, and Bicol “in order to prevent further loss of innocent lives.” 
On March 30, 2019, the second wave of Oplan Sauron claimed the lives of 14 people in 3 towns of Negros Oriental.  
Carmela Avelino, 42, recalled how her husband Edgardo, 59, died in the hands of the police in Canlaon City. 
It happened before sunrise. “They did not knock. They just entered and woke us up.”
Carmela was sleeping in her daughter’s room while Edgardo was on his favorite cot behind a huge dresser near the door.  
“Everyone was shouting. They told us to go out of the house. I ran and chased my daughter, who hurried outside because of fear of the armed men,” she said.  
She ran past the cot, but did not see her husband, who was already with the armed men in one of the rooms.  
“They told us to go inside the chapel,” she said. “We were so terrified. I was worried because my husband was still inside the house.”  
The chapel turned into a temporary holding area for people who were horrified of the sudden influx of armed men in their village.  
Carmela kept her eyes to the door of their house, waiting for Edgardo to come out, but he didn't – until “3 gunshots were fired.”  
She asked, “Why? Why my husband?” One of the policemen answered, “Because he is a leader of the communist rebels.”  
According to rights group Karapatan, at least 41 people were killed in the Negros provinces from November 2018 to July 28, 2019. 
Another group, the Unyon ng Manggagawa sa Agrikultura, has a list of at least 87 who were killed in Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental.  
Lawyer Maria Sol Taule of Karapatan claimed that the killings in Negros that involved civilians, rights defenders, activists, and farmers are “all state-sponsored.” 
“These killings are part of the intensified campaign against alleged supporters of the revolutionary movement,” she said. 
Taule said the method that the state forces are using “is not far from the method that they are using in the government’s anti-narcotics campaign.”  
She explained that Duterte’s memorandum order “gave the police and military justification to conduct an illegal search, arrest, and even killing.”  
“Then after a series of the so-called legitimate operations, they will use death squads to liquidate more unarmed civilians, mostly peasant leaders and allies of peasant organizations,” she added. 
Before Duterte's memo
The bloodshed that turned Negros Island into a killing field started even before President Duterte issued Memorandum Order No. 32. 
Defend Negros Movement recorded at least 84 political killings from 2017 up to this date. Nadja de Vera, convener of the group, said the order “was just issued to legalize the killings.”  
“The first victim of the extrajudicial killings in Negros since Duterte came to power was Alexander Ceballos on January 20, 2017,” she said. “After that incident, dozens of civilians, whom in one way or another had supported the plight of the farmers in Negros,” followed, she said. 
De Vera said the killings before Duterte’s memorandum order “did not make the headlines because the murders were done one by one on different occasions.” 
But on October 20, 2018, Negros Island became the subject of the lens of the media when 9 farmers were killed after they were fired upon by some 40 armed men at Hacienda Nene in Bulanon village in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. 
The victims, who were members of the National Federation of Sugar Workers, were workers at the plantation that had been placed under the agrarian reform program but remained in the hands of the owners.  
The recent spate of killings from July 23 to 28 in Negros, perpetrated by unidentified armed men, has taken the lives of 14 people, including a one-year-old boy. 
July 25 was the bloodiest when 7 civilians were killed.  
Philippine National Police chief General Oscar Albayalde on July 26 ordered a thorough and immediate investigation into the series of killings.  
National police spokesperson Brigadier General Bernard Banac said they already instructed the regional director “to resolve the series of killings” that they consider “to be crime incidents.” 
Church says no
On July 27, the 4 Catholic bishops of Negros Island issued a collegial pastoral statement urging the end to the “unfolding cycle of violence” that is gripping the province.  
Bishops Gerardo Alminaza of San Carlos, Julito Cortes of Dumaguete, Patricio Buzon of Bacolod, and Louie Galbines of Kabankalan denounced the “total disregard for the primacy and sanctity of human life.”  
“So much blood has already been spilled…. The blood of those killed cries to be heard. It calls out to our basic humanity to be one with those who have been afflicted by this violence,” their statement said.  
They also ordered all parishes to “toll the church bells” every evening at 8 o’clock until the killings stop. 
“In the stillness of the night, the tolling of the bells signifies our communion as Church. We are to remember those who have gone before us – including those whose lives have been snuffed by these killings – they, who are our brothers and sisters,” the statement added. 
The prelates urged the faithful to “pray the Oratio Imperata to end the killings” in the region.  
In a separate interview, Bishop Alminaza said that the “killing of another human being especially without due process… is inhumane, immoral, a violation of human right, and a grievous offense against God.”
The prelate said, “It is not for me to say who really are responsible for all the killings...but if it is committed by those entrusted with the sacred duty to defend life and rights, the killing becomes even more abominable.” 
He also urged the government to “avoid any militarist strategy” and instead “embrace the pathways to peace” through “socio-economic reforms.”  
“Peace cannot be achieved by guns or by killing fellow Filipinos. Once more, we, with the rest of the Filipino people, resonate the call to end the killings and to resume the peace talks,” the prelate added.  
On July 23, General Albayalde said, “Since the results [of Oplan Sauron] were good,” it will continue “not just in Negros but throughout the country.” 
For Cedine, the “violence” that orphaned her children “will not hinder us from seeking justice.” She admitted that she is afraid, but added that she has “the spirit to continue the fight for the right to life.” 
“I will not stop until justice is served. If I couldn’t be there to witness that day to come, I am sure my children will. – Rappler.com

In a survey held from March 25 to 28, 78% of respondents said they were satisfied with the war on drugs (43% very satisfied, 35% somewhat satisfied). On the other hand, 12% said they were unsatisfied (6% somewhat dissatisfied, 6% very dissatisfied).
""This gives a net satisfaction rating of +66, classified by SWS as very good,"" the polling firm said in a release to media.
Net satisfaction on the drug war went down from ""excellent"" to ""very good,"" SWS said.
The March 2017 net satisfaction rating was an 11-point decline from the 77+ rating during a similar survey in December 2016.
The polling firm defines ""net satisfaction"" as the difference between the percentage of those who were satisfied and those who were dissatisfied. The survey has an error margin of 3% for national percentages. 
EJKs, arresting suspects
Most Filipinos in the survey said they were worried that they or anyone they know would be a victim of ""extrajudicial killings.""
They were asked: ""Gaano po kayo nangangamba na kayo o sino mang kilala ninyo ay maging biktima ng 'extrajudicial killing o EJK'? (How worried are you that you or anyone you know will be a victim of 'extrajudicial killing or EJK'?)""
Of those polled, 73% said they were worried (37% very worried, 36% somewhat worried).
During the December 2016 poll, 78% said they were worried that they or someone they know would become EJK victims.
Since the war on drugs began in July 2016, police have noted a spike in murder and homicide cases nationwide, while reporting a decrease in all other crimes. Police have killed over 2,500 drug suspects in police operations and have tallied some 1,500 deaths with links to illegal drugs. Another 3,500 or so deaths are still being investigated. (READ: IN NUMBERS: The Philippines' 'war on drugs')
An overwhelming majority or 92% of respondents think it's important for police to capture drug suspects alive in the campaign on illegal drugs. During the December survey, 94% said keeping suspects alive was important.
Over two-thirds of those polled or 70% of respondents said the administration is serious about solving the problem of EJKs in the country.
Police have insisted that EJKs do not exist in the Philippines, since the killings, they say, are not state-sponsored.
'Nanlaban'?
But Filipinos are still ""split"" over whether they believe the police are telling the truth when they say slain suspects ""fought back"" (nanlaban, in Filipino) during operations.
24% of respondents said police were telling the truth (6% definitely telling the truth, 18% probably telling the truth) while a larger percentage or 44% said they were undecided.
Over 31% of respondents felt police were lying (17% probably not telling the truth, 14% definitely not telling the truth).
Malacañang welcomed the SWS survey results, saying it still showed that a ""great majority"" of Filipinos remain satisfied with the war on drugs ""notwithstanding the negative criticism we received here and abroad.""
""We note that the public (at 70%) believes the current administration is serious about solving the problem of so-called 'extrajudicial killings' (EJKs); and its efforts to cleanse the Philippine National Police,"" said Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella in a statement sent on Wednesday morning, April 19.
He made no mention of the drop in satisfaction with the anti-drug campaign.
The Palace also chose to focus on the bright side when it came to the figures showing that a majority of Filipinos worry about becoming victims of extrajudicial killings. Abella emphasized that the figures show a drop in those with this concern.
""Many Filipinos are less worried about their personal safety; as they feel safe and secure in the streets and at home,"" he said.
Given the support of many Filipinos for the war on drugs, Abella said, ""The drive will be relentless until the drug apparatus is rendered inutile."" – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – The human rights violations under President Rodrigo Duterte’s anti-illegal drugs campaign have “reached the threshold of crimes against humanity,” Amnesty International said. 
In its latest report, “They Just Kill,” published on Monday, July 8, the human rights group said the extrajudicial killings are “deliberate and systematic” in nature and appear to be part of a “government-orchestrated attack against poor people” allegedly involved in illegal drugs. 
Duterte’s violent war on drugs has led to at least 6,000 suspected drug personalities killed in police operations. Human rights groups meanwhile pegged the number at more than 20,000 including those killed vigilante-style. (READ: The Impunity Series) 
There is already sufficient evidence to conclude that these incidents constitute crimes against humanity, which are defined as “widespread or systematic attacks directed against any civilian population,” Amnesty International said.  
The report is the second the group released on Duterte's drug war with its 2017 report detailing stories of alleged police corruption and abuse.
Same patterns
The human rights group investigated 20 incidents (18 in police operations with two by unknown individuals) with a total of 27 people killed in Bulacan. The team interviewed a total of 58 people, including families of victims and witnesses of the executions. (READ: Central Luzon: New killing fields in Duterte's drug war)
The report identified patterns in “practically all cases” it examined, including police claims that the victims fought back despite families saying their killed relatives did not own a gun as they have no money to even get one. (READ: In the PH drug war, it's likely EJK when...)
“The victims of the drug-related killings examined by Amnesty International were overwhelmingly from poor and marginalized communities, in line with past research findings showing that the government’s anti-drug efforts chiefly target the poor,” it said. 
The findings of the latest report corroborate previous documentations by Amnesty International and other groups, which also include a “consistent pattern of police tampering with crime scenes, rigging evidence, and falsifying reports.” 
Families are also unable to file cases against those responsible. They told Amnesty International that their requests for documents, including police reports or blotters, are denied.  (READ: Duterte gov't allows 'drug war' deaths to go unsolved)
“Police reports that describe the circumstances of their loved one’s death are necessary for challenging the police’s version of events,” the report said. “As such, building a case almost always hinges upon the sharing of documents by police, which is now a dead end.”
They are also “turned away from police stations, either informed that the relevant investigator was not there, or given the runaround from station to station.”  
These findings are consistent with what other groups, including the Commission on Human Rights, have said pertaining to requests. State agents, mainly the Philippine National Police, have repeatedly denied the release of documents related to the war on drugs. (READ: Evading probes? The many times Duterte admin didn't give drug war documents)
In April 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the release of tens of thousands of documents related to the killings to the Center for International Law (CenterLaw) and the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG). The decision thumbed down Solicitor General Jose Calida’s argument that arguing the release will put national security at risk.
Investigations needed
Amnesty International called on Duterte to end his drug war and enforce a policy that “puts the protection of people’s health and rights at the center,” among others.  
The UN HRC, it said, should “adopt a resolution to create an independent, impartial and effective investigation into human rights violations in the context of the ‘war on drugs,’ including into the commission of crimes under international law, to establish the facts and circumstances, and take steps toward ensuring justice for the victims and their families.”
A resolution filed by Iceland seeking actions against the killings is up for voting at the UN HRC. If approved, it will request rights chief Michelle Bachelet prepare a comprehensive report and will urge the government to cooperate with UN offices and mechanisms by facilitating country visits and “refraining from all acts of intimidation or retaliation.” 
The ICC, meanwhile, is conducting its own preliminary examination which will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that the case against Duterte falls under its jurisdiction. (READ: Duterte throws out decade-long fight for the International Criminal Court) 
In December 2018, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor said it has “further closely followed relevant developments in the Philippines and will continue to do so.” – Rappler.com

True to the President's word, the ""war on drugs"" has been bloody more than 3 years into his administration.
Here are the numbers in the anti-illegal drug campaign according to the government, and from other sources that keep track of these statistics. 
This page will be updated regularly.
Noticeable is the huge disparity between official statistics and numbers cited by human rights groups that have contact with people on the ground.
Based on the government's official count through its #RealNumbersPH campaign, only 5,563 drug personalities have been killed in legitimate police operations as of December 31, 2019. Before that, however, on June 18, 2019, the Philippine National Police (PNP) itself reported a higher number: 6,600 drug suspects killed as of May 31, 2019.
Human rights organizations said that as of December 2018, the death toll could reach as high as 27,000, to include those killed outside police operations.
The PNP and the #RealNumbersPH campaign previously included statistics for ""deaths under investigation"" (DUI) or ""homicide cases under investigation"" (HCUI) which were broken down into 3 categories of cases: drug-related, non-drug-related, and those with motives still undetermined.
These HCUI figures are no longer included in the government's latest releases, with a presidential communications official explaining that they've decided on this to avoid these figures being ""mangled with other numbers.""
Based on data that Rappler obtained in June 2018, here’s a breakdown of HCUIs, as recorded by the PNP:
As of February 4, 2019, the PNP reported that there were at least 29,000 HCUIs, of which 3,062 were drug-related.
In March 2019, Rappler got updated data, showing that as of March 18, 2019, there have been a total of 30,145 homicide incidents or cases, but of the number, 11,098 were ""under investigation"" because the remaining 19,047 were tagged as ""cleared,"" with at least one suspect identified. The March 2019 data did not contain the 3 categories earlier listed for HCUIs.
[Editor's Note: Rappler previously reported at least 7,000 deaths in the #WarOnDrugs as of April 2017, based on figures from the PNP. Read our explanations on the changing figures here and here, as well as view a timeline of the PNP's use of the term ""deaths under investigation"".]
The government has also released the following statistics related to the drug war.
These were recorded from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 through its #RealNumbersPH campaign.
Anti-drug operations
High value targets arrested in anti-drug ops
Here’s a timeline of the changes in the government's manner of reporting its ""war on drugs"" statistics to the media since the start of the anti-drug campaign. 
As of 6 am of September 14, 2016, the number of suspects killed in police operations reached 1,506. But during a Senate probe on extrajudicial killings that day, then PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa said that after validation by its Directorate for Operations, the figure was corrected to only 1,105 deaths.
As of October 15, 2016, the number of policemen killed during operations stood at 13, while there were 40 wounded.
On October 19, 2016, deaths among police personnel rose to 15, while the number of wounded was revised to 36 after validation. The PNP broke down the casualties into drug-related and non-drug-related incidents, then reported only the drug-related casualties afterwards (7 dead, 24 wounded).
On October 26, 2016, the PNP launched Phase 2 of Oplan Double Barrel. After this, the statistics that the PNP started sending to media were ""reset"" to zero. However, on November 2, the PNP returned to its cumulative count from July 1.
On November 7, 2016, the PNP returned to reporting the total casualties, doing away with its categorization the month before. 
Police involvement in the ""war on drugs"" was temporarily suspended on January 30, 2017, when Duterte instructed the PNP to first rid its ranks of corrupt personnel. This was after some policemen reportedly got involved in the kidnap and murder of a South Korean businessman in October 2016. 
Weeks later, on February 27, 2017, the President allowed the PNP back into the ""war on drugs"" campaign, but with limited participation through smaller task forces.
On March 6, 2017, the PNP officially relaunched its participation in the ""war on drugs,"" in a campaign dubbed Oplan Double Barrel Alpha Reloaded.
The PNP initially started keeping track of Double Barrel Alpha Reloaded statistics from March 6, based on messages sent to the media. But in its data update on March 30, 2017, the PNP readjusted the start date earlier, to March 1.
Around March 2017, the PNP changed the term, ""deaths under investigation."" In a report that Rappler requested, the PNP used the term ""homicide cases under investigation"" or HCUI, which were further classified into 3 types of incidents: drug-related, non-drug-related, and those whose motives had yet to be determined.
On May 2, 2017, the government launched its #RealNumbersPH campaign, its new manner of disseminating statistics related to the ""war on drugs."" Compared to past media releases, it no longer included figures on the number of houses visited as part of Oplan TokHang.
Starting in its August 2017 update, the #RealNumbersPH social media graphics also no longer included the number of surrenderers.
In October 2017, the PNP's role in the ""war on drugs"" was suspended a second time, after President Duterte made the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) the sole agency in charge of the anti-illegal drug campaign. The PNP resumed providing active support to PDEA in December 2017.
The #RealNumbersPH figures that were released showed complete HCUI figures from March to June 2017 only. From January to March 2018, only drug-related homicide cases were announced. Since then, #RealNumbersPH figures totally excluded HCUI statistics.
In an August 17, 2018 press briefing on #RealNumbersPH, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Ana Marie Banaag explained that they stopped presenting HCUI figures because ""it gets mangled with other numbers; it gets confused with other numbers, so we chose not to.""
Banaag said, however, that HCUI figures can be requested from the PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM). – Rappler.com"

“Ay ko sunda, Tulisan ko (Don’t follow me, I’m a robber),"" said a cardboard sign hung over his neck.
The victim was identified as Dante Autero. According to Brigadier General Debold Sinas, director of the Police Regional Office 7, the victim was a “notorious” drug personality who had been in and out of prison.
Residents in the area told police they heard gunshots at around 3 am before his body was discovered hanging from the Mananga Bridge early morning.
The killing is reminiscent of the early days of the drug war from 2016 to 2017, when victims of extrajudicial killings were found with cardboard signs on their necks saying they were allegedly drug pushers or robbers, or otherwise guilty of committing other kinds of crimes.
Sinas said however that the doubts the Autero’s murder was the work of a vigilante group. “If it were vigilantes, they would have sent warnings ahead of time but there were none,” he told reporters.
This is the second killing in Metro Cebu in the span of 24 hours. Manuel Daposala, 46, was killed Sunday morning while buying water from an automatic dispenser on Cabantan Street in Cebu City, near the access road to the Cebu Business Park.
Two unidentified suspects shot him point blank in the neck and chest.
The United Nations recently passed a resolution, spearheaded by Iceland, to investigate the Philippines' war on drugs which has led to at least 6,000 suspected drug personalities killed in police operations. (READ: PH drug war killings reach 'threshold of crimes against humanity' – report)

Such allegations were hurled at Duterte even before his presidential candidacy. He, however, has constantly denied any involvement with the vigilante group, even challenging his critics to directly file a case against him. (READ: Duterte: ‘Am I the death squad? True’)
Duterte even pointed out, in one campaign sortie, that Senator and former justice secretary Leila de Lima failed to file a case against him.
As Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chairperson then, De Lima initiated a probe into the Davao City mayor’s involvement with the DDS, which has been accused of carrying out at least 1,000 summary killings.
In 2012, CHR released a resolution stating that it found “probable cause” and recommended that the Office of the Ombudsman investigate the “possible administrative and criminal liability” of Duterte in relation to the numerous killings under his watch as Davao City mayor.
Thursday, June 28, marks 6 years since the CHR resolution on the DDS was released. What has happened since?
In 2009, CHR conducted public hearings in Davao City on the killings between 2005 to 2009 attributed to the DDS.
It identified 206 deaths attributable to the DDS within this period – with 157 victims shot.
At least 107 victims between 2005 to 2009 had records or were suspected to have been involved in illegal activities. However, there were several instances of mistaken identity.
A report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in 2009 identified Jaypee Larosa as a victim of mistaken identity.
The 20-year-old was gunned down on July 17, 2008 by “three men in dark jackets who had arrived on a motorcycle"" while he was in a neighbor Internet cafe.
However, according to witnesses, one gunman was overheard saying in Filipino, “Son of a bitch, this is not the one.” Larosa, a young man with no criminal record and who lived in one of Davao City's quiet residential neighborhoods, was reportedly mistaken for a suspected robber.
The roster of victims also included minors, including 3 of Clarita Alia's 4 sons.
Alia narrated to HRW that her 4 sons – 18-year-old Richard, 17-year-old Christopher, 14-year-old Bobby, and 15-year-old Fernando – were killed one after another between July 2001 and April 2007.
CHR also found a “distinct pattern” of killings – victims “usually involved or suspected to have been involved” in illegal activities were gunned down by men riding motorcycles.
Despite this, Duterte denied that the killings were carried out by a particular group. He said that any government employee or military/police personnel involved were doing it on their own.
However, the use of .45 caliber handguns – which are “expensive” – was an indication of the “officially-sanctioned character of the killings,” according to the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions.
Despite constant denial and “dearth of evidence to support a finding of direct compliance,” the Commission pointed out the “systematic failure” of local government officials and police to conduct in-depth investigations into the local killings.
In fact, a senior police officer told CHR, only 24.59% percent of killings between January and August 2009 were “solved.”
The CHR resolution concluded that the local government is liable as it did not adopt reasonable measures despite knowledge of “a real and immediate threat.”
As the local chief executive and deputized National Police Commission (Napolcom) representative, Duterte “clearly disregarded” the information available on the killings committed in his jurisdiction.
“The continuing pattern of killings and the failure to conduct a meaningful investigation of such incidents can be construed as tolerance on the part of the authorities of the crimes, thereby contributing to the climate of impunity,” the CHR added.
As early as 2005, even the US embassy had taken notice of the rise of vigilante killings in several areas in the Philippines – specifically in Davao City and Cebu City. Based on what the embassy had heard, the report said the killings “seem very popular with the publics in Davao and Cebu.”
The report also said, “Mayors Duterte and [Tomas] Osmeña clearly condone the killings – which have not hurt their political standing in the slightest and apparently given them some bounce in popularity.”
The CHR came up with recommendations based on the results of its probe. However, 4 years on, little is known about what happened since.
The Office of the Ombudsman, according to the CHR in its resolution, should investigate the “possible administrative and criminal liability of Duterte for his inaction in the face of evidence of numerous killings committed in Davao City and his toleration of the commission of those offenses.”
Prior to the CHR resolution, the Office of the Ombudsman in March 2012 found 21 police officers guilty of simple neglect of duty in relation to the vigilante killings, recommending penalties ranging from one month suspension to a fine equivalent to a month's salary.
According to the Ombudsman, the ""unusually high number of unsolved killings"" was evidence that the local police force were ""remiss in their duty."" (READ: Ombudsman suspends cops for 'Davao Death Squad' killings)
However, in a statement released in 2015, HRW hit the Ombudsman for limiting its investigations to the police officers implicated ""and not Duterte himself.""
But according to a letter sent to CHR by the Office of the Ombudsman dated January 15, 2016 obtained by Rappler, the investigations on the DDS have been ""closed and terminated.""
The letter cited a fact-finding report dated May 5, 2014 submitted by the Field Investigation Office to Overall Deputy Ombudsman Arthur Carandang. The report quoted then CHR Region XI Director Alberto Sipaco Jr as saying that his office does not have any proof that the death squad does exist. The field investigation office also echoed Sipaco's statement that the allegations remain as ""chismis and other gossips.""
CHR Region XI covers Davao.
But in 2009, Sipaco, a member of Duterte's fraternity Lex Talionis, told then-United States ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenny that Duterte knew about the killings and permits them, according to a confidential cable published by WikiLeaks. (READ: Duterte 'admitted complicity' in Davao killings – WikiLeaks)
CHR recommended through the 2012 resolution the conduct of a “serious, impartial, and effective investigation” by several government agencies into the deaths attributed to the DDS to prosecute people responsible.
These investigations, the commission added, should include the “possible omissions, negligence, and obstructions of justice” done by the local government officials and police force.
In May 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that the probe had halted as the sole witness had left the government’s Witness Protection Program (WPP).
Outgoing justice secretary Emmanuel Caparas said “it’s very difficult to do anything” about the case unless the person resurfaced. (READ: DOJ halts probe into Davao Death Squad)
""It's very difficult to proceed on that basis,"" he said in a press conference in May. ""There are affidavits but if you want to confirm the affidavit, you have to talk to the witness. But the witness is not there.""
De Lima, meanwhile, said on May 22 that the witness had asked to leave the program when she stepped down from office in October 2015.
The decision of the witness, according to the senator, was “definitely in reaction to Duterte’s victory.”
Investigations into the existence of the Davao Death Squad took a new turn in 2016 with the confessions of two former alleged members.
The victims allegedly ordered killed by Duterte include broadcaster Jun Pala, bodyguards of ex-House speaker and then-mayoral candidate Prospero Nograles, a certain Sali Makdum, and Jun Barsabal, among others. (TIMELINE: Witness lists killings allegedly 'ordered by Duterte’)
Self-confessed hitman Edgar Matobato surfaced before a Senate hearing in September 2016 and accused Duterte and his son, Davao Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte of behind some of the killings carried out by the death squad. (READ: ‘Killed for no reason’: Matobato’s claims on the Davao Death Squad)
Retired Davao policeman Arturo ""Arthur"" Lascañas, meanwhile, did a 180-degree turn and retracted his previous denials. He corroborated earlier claims by Matobato on the involvement of Duterte in killings, adding that they received P20,000 to P100,000 per hit.
But the Senate hearings on these confessions resulted to nothing. According to senators, there are still no evidence pertaining to the existence of the DDS and Duterte's involvement, despite the other 4 witnesses who gave their testimonies in 2009. (READ: Lascañas, Matobato were not the first DDS whistle-blowers)
CHR, meanwhile, formed a new team to investigate the claims of Matobato and Lascañas. – Rappler.com

In one of the most scathing homilies against EJKs, David also questioned why the Philippine National Police (PNP) fails to catch these vigilantes, and also if the PNP has resolved even one of those they call ""deaths under investigation"" (DUIs). 
The bishop then prayed for the ""traitors and the new Judases of our country."" 
David recalled an earlier homily at the funeral of 19-year-old Raymart Siapo, a person with disability (PWD) who reportedly found himself on his community's drug watch list after a verbal tussle with his neighbor. 
Siapo eventually became one of the thousands of EJK victims in the Philippines. 
David addressed Siapo's killers in his funeral homily: ""Kung nakikinig kayo, ibig kong malaman ninyo na alam ng Diyos kung sino kayo. Hindi alam ng pulis, hindi alam ng barangay, hindi alam ng kapamilya ng biktima. Pero alam ng Diyos. Hindi ninyo maitatago sa Kanya ang mga pagmumukha ninyo, kahit mag-bonnet pa kayo. Kilala kayo ng Diyos.""
(If you are listening, I want you to know that God knows who you are. The police do not know, the village does not know, the relatives of the victim do not know. But God knows. You cannot hide from Him your faces, even if you wear bonnets. God knows you.)
""Nais kong malaman ninyo na ang pinatay ninyo ay hindi lang si Raymart kundi mga sarili ninyo, mga kaluluwa ninyo. Habambuhay kayong uusigin,"" David told Siapo's killers. ""Hindi kayo patatahimikin ng inyong mga konsensya, kung meron pang natitira. At hindi rin ako magugulat kung naririto rin sila ngayon, nakaupo at nagsisimba."" 
(I want you know that the person you killed is not only Raymart but yourselves, your souls. You will forever be haunted. Your conscience will not leave you in peace, if there's anything left of it. And I won't be surprised if they're also here right now, seated and hearing Mass.)
David also told vigilantes: ""Kung iniisip ninyo na ang ginagawa ninyo ay paglilingkod sa bayan, nagkakamali kayo. Hindi malulutas ng krimen ang mga kriminalidad."" (If you think that what you're doing is public service, you are wrong. Crime cannot solve criminality.)
'Walk for Life' in Navotas
David delivered his homily on Sunday as hundreds of Catholics joined a ""Walk for Life"" in Navotas City on the same day.
Mostly wearing white, the participants prayed the rosary while walking from one church to another – around one kilometer or 30 minutes, from San Ildefonso Parish to the Church of San Jose de Navotas – to pray for EJK victims in the Diocese of Kalookan. 
The Walk for Life was held around 5 am on Sunday, and was followed by a 6:15 am Mass presided over by David. The procession on Sunday was like the Walk for Life attended by around 10,000 people in Manila on February 18. 
David's jurisdiction, the Diocese of Kalookan, covers the cities of Caloocan (South), Malabon, and Navotas, known hotspots for drug-related killings.
David, 58, a leading Bible scholar educated in the Catholic University of Louvain, is one of the bishops most outspoken against EJKs in the Philippines. (READ: Impunity: The Church of the Resistance)
The brother of sociologist Randy David, he has been Kalookan bishop since January 2016. Before this, he served as auxiliary bishop of San Fernando, Pampanga, for nearly a decade.
'Termites' in society
In his homily on Sunday, David compared vigilantes to white termites who silently gnaw on wood from the inside, until all that remains is wooden skin.
He explained that termites would make it seem like the foundations of a house remain sturdy. ""Iyon pala parang sitsaron; wala nang laman sa loob, kinain na ng anay, at minsan bigla na lang mawawasak, guguho ang bahay."" (Then it turns out to be like pork cracklings; it is empty inside, eaten by termites, and sometimes will just collapse.)
""Ito ang mas nakakatakot at tunay na salot,"" the bishop said. ""Hindi lang mga bahay ang inaanay. Ang lipunan din."" (This is the real and more terrifying plague... Termites attack not only homes, but also society.)
David then cited vigilantes in the cities of Navotas, Caloocan, and Malabon, who kill people every day, ""like white termites who remain unseen.""
David questioned why police and village officials fail to catch these vigilantes, even if closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras can be found on every street. 
David said: ""'Yung mga simpleng pagnanakaw katulad nu'ng mga humahablot ng bag sa kalsada, madalas nakikita natin 'yan sa TV. Pero 'yung dumudukot ng tao sa harapan ng sariling mga anak at kapamilya, at pumapaslang sa kanila na walang kalaban-laban, sa ating mga purok, sa ating mga kalye, sa ating mga barangay, hindi sila nakikita. Bakit ba? Invisible ba sila?""
(Petty crimes, such as stealing a bag on the street, can often be seen on TV. But those who abduct people in front of their children and relatives, and kill them who are helpless, in our communities, our streets, our villages, cannot be seen. Why? Are they invisible?)
8 people killed in 5 minutes
On DUIs, David said, ""Gusto ko sanang malaman kung meron na bang nareresolba, kahit isa, sa mga death under investigation? Kahit isa lang."" (I just want to know if they have resolved even just one of these cases of deaths under investigation? Even just one.)
He pointed out that in cases of EJKs, police reports usually state that the victim is a ""drug suspect killed by unidentified hitmen.""
""Kapag tinatanong ko ang kapulisan tungkol sa mga pinapaslang ng mga bonnet gang, kadalasan sinasabi nila, 'Drug suspect talaga 'yon.' Matagal nang nasa drug watch list nila. Na parang ibig sabihin, case closed. Na para bang ibig sabihin, okay lang na pinatay sila dahil adik naman talaga o pusher talaga,"" he said.
(Whenever I ask policemen about those being killed by bonnet gangs, they often say, ""That's really a drug suspect."" They say he's really on their drug watch list. As if to say, case closed. As if to mean, it was okay to kill them because they're really addicts or pushers.)

Photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler
David – who, in his smartphone, keeps a list of EJK victims – recalled specific cases of vigilante killings. 
One of these is the murder of the relatives and friends of Jay-R Santor, an alleged drug suspect. 
David said 4 of Santor's friends refused to reveal his whereabouts to vigilantes. All 4 of them ended up killed in front of Santor's house – Jonel Segovia, 15; Sonny Espinosa, 16; Angelito Soriano, 16; and Kenneth Lim, 20.
Inside Santor's house, he said vigilantes also massacred Santor's mother, Cristina; his brother, Ednel; and his pregnant sister, Analyn.
""Sa loob ng 5 minuto, 8 ang napatay nila, kasama na ang sanggol sa tiyan ni Analyn. Pero ang talagang hinahanap nila ay hindi nila natagpuan doon,"" David said. (In 5 minutes, they killed 8 people, including the baby in the womb of Analyn. But they failed to find the one they were really looking for.)
""Pagkatapos ng 3 araw, lumabas sa balita, Jay-R Santor, napaslang. Nahanap na rin nila. Pero ubos ang buong pamilya ni Jay-R Santor,"" he added. (After 3 days, the news said Jay-R Santor was killed. They were able to find him. But Jay-R Santor's family was also wiped out.)
'New Judases'
David closed his homily with a prayer, asking God's forgiveness for all these sins.
""Salamat sa biyaya ng Eukaristiya, sa biyaya ng patawad at kaligtasan, pati na sa mga traydor at mga bagong Hudas sa aming bayan,"" he said. (Thank you for the gift of the Eucharist, for the gifts of forgiveness and salvation, even for the traitors and new Judases in our country.)
For many Catholics who joined the mass for EJK victims, however, the ""termites"" appeared to have made their presence felt during Sunday's Mass.
At around 4:30 am on Sunday – or 30 minutes before the Walk for Life began – members of the San Jose de Navotas Parish learned that there was no electricity in their church.
Aurora Santiago, president of the Council of the Laity of the Diocese of Kalookan, said there was electricity in the priest's residence and the nearby school, and the outage curiously affected only the church building itself.
David said Mass using only a generator connected to either the priest's residence or the nearby school.
""Hindi ho namin maintindihan kung bakit walang kuryente dito lang sa simbahan. May kuryente ho sa buong Navotas, pero dito lang sa simbahan, biglang nawala,"" David said at the start of his homily.
(We can't understand why there's no power only here in church. There's power in the whole of Navotas, but it is gone only here.)
""Ewan ko lang kung bakit nangyayari ang mga bagay-bagay na ito. Parang may ibig pumigil sa ating dapat gawin ngayong umaga (I don't know why things like this are happening. It seems like some people want to stop us from achieving our goals this morning),"" David said, as ""termites"" continue to roam the country. – Rappler.com

Yap, who was Escalante City mayor when the attacks took place, faces trial for 4 counts of murder and one count of frustrated murder, the Ombudsman said in a statement on Thursday, July 14.
Charged with Yap are Richard Patpat, Rolando Catayan, Joel Villarin, Jay Vargas, JR Buhat, Gregory Tuayon, Bernardino Patigas, Hernando Llorente, Rolando Llamata, Lorenzo Perolino, Joey Llorente, Eleazar Navas, and 3 others known only by their aliases – Renan, Bam-Bam, and Bob Soler.
The Ombudsman said its investigation showed that the 5 victims were known supporters of Yap’s former political opponent.
Sun.Star Bacolod reported in June that the victims in the murders cases are Ferjun Damalerio, Armando Lutrago, Eric Matugas and Jury Alsado Sr; and Fernando Damalerio, the victim in the frustrated murder case – all supporters of former Escalante mayor Santiago Barcelona Jr.
The New People’s Army had claimed responsibility for the attacks on Barcelona’s supporters but the Ombudsman, in its consolidated resolution, gave credence to the testimonies of witnesses who cited Yap’s close links with the group.
According to the Ombudsman's press statement, “the witnesses disclosed that Yap supplied the CPP-NPA Command of its logistical needs and alleged that Yap exercised considerable influence over the Command.”
“The sworn statement [by witnesses] is given the presumption of credibility absent any showing that they are motivated by ill-will,” the resolution said.
“This Office is inclined to believe that that motive for these crimes were political,” said Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales.
Yap served as Escalante mayor from 2007 to 2016, before he won as Negros Occidental First District representative. 
In 2011, the National Police Commission stripped Yap of his supervisory power over the local police over allegations that he was sympathetic to the NPA, and the continuing extrajudicial killings in Escalante. 
In April 2013, families of victims of extrajudicial killings in Escalante filed murder and frustrated murder complaints against the then mayor and several others before the city prosecutor’s office. – Rappler.com"

PNP spokesperson Chief Superintendent Dionardo Carlos issued the statement late Friday afternoon to correct an announcement he had made hours earlier – that there has been only one case of extrajudicial killing since Duterte became president.
""The PNP protects every individual's right to life. To allay or remove their fear of becoming victims of EJK, let it be known that under the present administration, there is only one case of extra-judicial killing or EJK for the period July 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017,"" Carlos said in his text message to reporters past 10 am on Friday.
The PNP spokesperson made the statement in response to the results of the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey which showed that 7 in 10 Filipinos fear that they may become victims of extrajudicial killings.
Carlos initially said the only extrajudicial killing the PNP recognizes is the case of slain journalist Larry Que in Catanduanes.
Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua, and Police Officer 1 Vincent Tacorda, the whistleblower cop who claimed he can no longer stomach illegal activities in their police force, had been implicated in Que's case. (READ: The tangled web in publisher Larry Que's slay case)
While Tacorda had recanted his statement, Carlos said at first that Que's case was still considered as extrajudicial killing.  ""Tacorda retracted his statement but Que is still dead, so the case still stands,"" Carlos initially said.
Hours later, Carlos sent another statement to the media correcting his earlier figure, after the task force  in charge of cases of killings of media people and political activists pointed out his ""mistake.""
""I was corrected by TF Usig that the Larry Que case is not a confirmed EJK case. so officially, no case..... I stand corrected,"" the PNP spokesperson said in his text message sent past 4 pm.
Definition
While the PNP does not recognize any cases of extrajudicial killing under the Duterte administration, the PNP counts at least 3,850 drug suspects killed in their anti-drug operations, and at least 2,290 killed for drug-related motives, mostly slain by unidentified assailants.
Some cops, particularly from Caloocan City, had also come under fire for the killings of teenagers Kian delos Santos and Carl Arnaiz. 
Carlos clarified that the PNP uses the definition of extrajudicial killing as provided  under Administrative Order 35 issued by the Aquino administration.
Under the order, extrajudicial killings are defined as committed by ""state and non-state forces"" to silence, ""through violence and intimidation, legitimate dissent and opposition raised by members of the civil society, cause-oriented groups, political movements, people’s and non-governmental organizations, and by ordinary citizens."" 
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Saturday, October 7, that while they are confined to the definition as stated under AO 35, the government recognizes that ""one death is one too many.""
""We wish to emphasize that one death is one too many. Regardless of  this definition, these deaths are being addressed to ensure the accountability of perpetrators, even as it calls upon witnesses and individuals who can provide valuable evidence that will lead to speedy resolution of cases,"" Abella said.
Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano used the same definition when he made a presentation to the United Nations Human Rights Council in May, and maintained that there was no new wave of killings in the Philippines under Duterte. (READ: CHR refutes Cayetano: We did not change definition of EJKs)
According to the international definition, an extrajudicial killing is an execution done by government actors without going through the legal process. – Rappler.com

SWS did survey wrong, says PNP",,"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) believes that the survey on the perception of extrajudicial killings (EJK) in the country was incorrectly done by polling firm Social Weather Stations (SWS).
""I don't want to dispute the statistics derived from SWS except there is something amiss with how the questions are framed in relation to the perception [of] the alleged police involvement in illegal drugs and alleged EJK,"" PNP chief Director General Oscar Albayalde read from a prepared statement in a Camp Crame briefing on Monday, March 4.
In a survey conducted from December 16 to 19, 2018, the SWS found that 78%, or almost 4 out of 5 Filipinos, are worried that they, or someone they know, will be a victim of EJK amid the administration's relentless campaign against illegal drugs.
According to the police chief, the question of the SWS was leading, and bound to evoke fear from respondents because of its phrasing, ""How worried are you that you or anyone you know will be a victim of 'extrajudicial killing’ or EJK?""
""Mali naman kaagad na 'Gaano kayo nangangamba.' Everyone will be scared of course, sino ba ang 'di takot mamatay, sino ba ang 'di takot mabiktima ng krimen?"" Albayalde said. (It is wrong that you start with ""How worried are you."" Everyone will be scared, of course. Who is not afraid of dying? Who is not afraid of being victimized by crime?)
Albayalde added that the SWS should have ""provided a briefing to define EJK.""
How is EJK defined? The PNP definition of EJK follows Administrative Order 35 of the Aquino administration.
The order defines EJKs as committed by ""state and non-state forces"" to silence, ""through violence and intimidation, legitimate dissent and opposition raised by members of the civil society, cause-oriented groups, political movements, people’s and non-governmental organizations, and by ordinary citizens.""
However, there is a new definition of EJK that bolsters the high number of claims of human rights advocates. Newly-signed Republic Act No 11188 or the Act for Special Protection of Children in Situations of Armed Conflict defines EJK as follows:
""Extrajudicial killings refer to all acts and omissions of State actors that constitute violation of the general recognition of the right to life embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UNCRC and similar other human rights treaties to which the Philippines is a state party."" – Rappler.com

BACOLOD CITY, Philippines - Families of the victims of extrajudicial killings in Escalante City, Negros Occidental called on President Benigno Aquino anew to act on the killings.
About 8,000 residents joined a rally on Saturday, April 20, to demand justice for the victims of extrajudicial killings in the city since 2007.
According to Luke Espiritu, counsel of the victims, such killings have claimed 25 lives in the city.
Tessie Villadar Damalerio, whose son and brother were among victims, said President Aquino and Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas should immediately act on the findings of Task Force Escalante, the body that investigated the deaths.The report of Task Force Escalante was submitted to the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) last year.
""Do we have to wait for another killing to take place before you act?"" Damalerio asked.
Police records showed that majority of killings in Escalante, the most recent being the assassination of Police Officer 1 Beijen Tanguan and police asset Joseph Lutrago, were perpetrated by the New People’s Army (NPA).Lutrago's brother, Jonathan, who also participated in the rally, claimed that NPA rebels behind the killings are in the payroll of a politician.Peace advocates in the province also expressed dismay, saying authorities have forgotten the cases. 
Impunity
Espiritu said the culture of impunity in Escalante is too much already. “The government has to intervene now, replace the policemen and place Escalante under Comelec control,” he added.The call to place the city under Comelec control is being supported by re-electionist governor Alfredo Marañon Jr. and Escalante mayoral candidate Santiago Barcelona, who were both present in the rally.Barcelona, who is running against reelectionist mayor Melecio Yap, said 18 of the 25 victims of extrajudicial killings in the city were his supporters.
A former mayor himself, Barcelona lost to Yap in the 2010 mayoral race. His wife, Alice, also lost to Yap in the 2007 elections.
Yap and 8 others, including a retired Army major and a former policeman, were charged last week for 3 counts of murder and two counts of frustrated murder in connection with the spate of killings in the city.
Another rally
On the other hand, supporters of Yap also held on Saturday a prayer rally, just 250 meters away from the rally attended by Marañon and Barcelona.

Yap said he welcomes the charges filed against him. He said he wants to clear his name in the proper forum. At the same time, Yap also warned he would file counter-charges against those who he said fabricated lies about him.His lawyer, Dan Pondevilla, questioned the motive for the filing of charges against Yap. ""Why only now, when the election is about to happen?""
Pondevilla added the claims have no basis, and that many killings have already been solved and suspects were charged in court.
Yap also dismissed Marañon's previous comment describing the killings in Escalante as worse than the Maguindanao massacre. The reelectionist mayor said the statement is “unfair to Escalantehanons.”""Why is he (Governor Marañon) frequently visiting Escalante, if the place is not peaceful? It is because he is afraid to lose,"" he added.In 2011, Yap was stripped of his supervisory power over the local police following allegations that he was sympathetic to the NPA, and because of the killings in the city.
Escalante falls under Category 1 of the Comelec watchlist due to the employment of private armed groups by candidates and intense political rivalries. - Rappler.com"

The PDEA’s latest count, from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2019, showed that lives of 5,526 people were claimed in the course of 134,583 anti-drug operations by the government, while 193,086 drug personalities were arrested in that period. Majority of the operations were carried out by the Philippine National Police (PNP).
The PDEA's findings are part of #RealNumbersPH, the government's effort to counter what it called a ""false narrative"" on the war on drugs.
Outside the PDEA's count, rights groups estimate the drug war to have claimed as much as 27,000 lives, including the victims of vigilante-style killings. (READ: PH drug war killings reach 'threshold of crimes against humanity' – report)
PDEA's latest data showed a continuous climb in the number of deaths, with an additional 476 kills since the end of 2018. Prior to this, the government recorded 5,050 suspects killed in anti-drug operations as of November 30, 2018. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Along with the high death toll, the government also reported 7,054 ""high value targets"" and 681 government workers were arrested in anti-drug operations. Among the government workers were 323 government employees, 282 elected officials, and 76 uniformed personnel.
Aside from this, the Philippine National Police said 2,367 cops have been dismissed from service as part of its internal cleansing program.
Halfway mark: In the previous SONA, Duterte vowed his drug war would not be sidelined as he dismissed international criticism over his campaign. The President vowed his anti-drug campaign would be ""as chilling as on the day it began.""
Duterte amped up his actions by releasing a list tagging politicians of supposedly being involved in illegal drug operations just weeks before the 2019 midterm elections held last May.
Meanwhile, glaring gaps in the government's anti-drug campaign have prompted certain sectors to question the operation before the Supreme Court. The petitioners were asking the High Court to declare as unconstitutional the anti-drugs campaign.
In April 2019, the High Court ordered the release of thousands of drug war documents, despite efforts to block it by the Solicitor General.
Recently, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in July 2019 adopted a resolution to look into drug war killings in the Philippines. It tasked the UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to write a comprehensive report on the situation in the Philippines and present this to the council. (READ: U.N. rights chief: Deaths in PH anti-drug operations a ‘most serious concern’)
Malacañang, though, has so far shown no signs it would cooperate with the completion of the comprehesive report, instead calling it an ""insult"" to Filipinos. (READ: On U.N. resolution vs drug war killings: What if Duterte blocks review?) 
Not yet over: Despite this, the government has claimed the drug war is far from over with officials tagging it as a ""protective measure"" for ""law-abiding citizens"" against supposed errant drug users.
It claimed 13,753 of the 42,045 total barangays have been cleared since June 2019. This leaves 19,215 that have yet to be ""cleared.""
This is an additional 3,754 barangays cleared since the start of the year. Prior to this, PDEA reported 9,999 barangays were cleared as of December 31, 2018. – Rappler.com

Nanette Castillo has felt it. It has numbed her. On October 2, 2017, she lost her son Aldrin, who was shot to death by unidentified men on motorcycles just across their house on Herbosa Street, Tondo, Manila. 
Nanette slumped beside him on the street, feeling every last bit of warmth escaping his body before it was taken by funeral workers. She was hysterical – cursing the cops who did not bother to call an ambulance, even hastily blaming her daughter for asking Aldrin to come to their home in Tondo in the first place. 
“I knew he was dead, but I still wanted to bring him to the hospital. I was hysterical. I screamed at the police – you sons of bitches, are you God?"" she recalled in Filipino.
On Wednesday, March 7, Nanette counted it as the 157th day since that gruesome night. She counts every single day without Aldrin, describing each day without him ""only heavier than the day before.""
She spoke before lawyers and law students at ""Rise, Resist, Unite against Tokhang and Tyranny,” a forum on the human rights implications of President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, organized by a new network of lawyers, Mga Manananggol Laban sa EJK or MANLABAN sa EJK.
Many have told Nanette that it was futile to pursue a case against Aldrin’s killers, who have remained unidentified to this day. But she is hopeful, even confident, that there is more to this catharsis than just grieving and letting go. 
She is not afraid to admit that Aldrin used drugs. Not once had he been involved in trouble anyway, she said. Aldrin is neither listed in the barangay watch list nor does he have any criminal records in the Manila Police District. 
In fact, the 32-year old bachelor was supposed to go to Saudi Arabia to work as a professional welder had he not been killed. Both unemployed, Nanette and her husband relied mostly on Aldrin's support. “He was never a burden to us,” Nanette said. “Maybe in the eyes of Duterte he is a plague, but to us, Duterte is the plague."" 
Speak for other women

While Nanette is far from finding justice for Aldrin, she remains vocal about her story of victimization, especially after working with faith-based group Rise Up for Life and for Rights. 
She tells Rappler speaking out is the least she could do for her son. But, more importantly, she says she speaks on behalf of those who cannot, or who would not, speak.  
“Other victims are scared,” Nanette said. “I want them to be empowered, I want mothers to be enlightened. You have to stand up because you are victims, you have nothing to be afraid of. And even if you aren’t victims, you should speak up.”
Indeed, Nanette is but one of the thousands of women who are left to “claw their way out of bereavement, anger, marginalization, and poverty.” 
In the same forum, National Union of Peoples Lawyers (NUPL) chairman Neri Colmenares spoke about this particular issue, suffering women who are mostly alone. 
“For every tokhang victim, there is a woman wailing beside,” Colmenares said. “Out there are ten thousand mothers who have borne the personal brunt of the loss of a husband or a child."" 
“It’s the women who will be picking up the breadwinner's mantle and teaching the children how to cope with grief and anger, with dignity and honor. It will take feisty and consistent female courage to take this administration, and perpetrators and enablers, to account,” he added.
Nanette seems to be an exception to this statement, as she does not need much courage to do what she does. She tells herself she’s gone through the worst. “What do I have to be afraid of, when I’ve already lost my son?"" 
“This is why you can’t bully me, Duterte. I cannot be bullied” Nanette said.  
Fight like a woman
But with thousands of mothers and daughters left behind, there are only few like Nanette who could face the camera to speak out against the killings. 
Angela (not her real name), a mother like Nanette, opts to go a different way – the legal way.
Unlike Nanette, Angela is certain that cops are responsible for her son’s death because he was arrested at a checkpoint a few days before he was found dead in a morgue in Manila. 
Confident that her son was innocent, Angela found herself investigating the case, finding links to clarify the puzzling death of her son. 
She fought hard to get copies of police reports and CCTV footage, even if it meant sending out 60 letters of request. 
She was determined to pursue her fight, but she questioned herself: “How do I defend my son who did not even do anything wrong?”
Angela is now represented by the NUPL, specifically Attorney Krissy Conti, who has been involved in cases of extrajudicial killings related to the drug war.
As a woman herself, Conti says it has been easier for mothers to connect and share their stories to her, knowing full well that there is a common understanding between women. 
“The female factor is the trust given to you by mothers because they know you can relate – which I dont see with their relations with male lawyers. They are stiff and formal with male lawyers, but with women lawyers they are relaxed,” Conti said. 
Conti said she understands the plight of these women, knowing that it is most painful for any parent to predecease a child. This is why women will be the ""moving force"" of this fight against extrajudicial killings, she said. 
Conti said it would be a challenge for women, however, to communicate their issues to the sexist President Duterte. She wonders how Duterte would deal with the issue of so many wailing women who will come to him. 
“He doesn't listen because he's a populist, and we only have one, two, three [women speaking out]. If 5,000, 10,000 women would pester him, things might change,” Conti said in Filipino.
With more and more women victimized by Duterte’s war on drugs, Conti said there is a need to double the effort women to come together. “Mothers and daughters share empathy differently,” she said. 
To organize, Conti and her fellow advocates against EJKs coined the term “WoManlaban” to engrave what it means for every woman to fight in this war on drugs. It also a play on the word ""nanlaban"" (fought back), the reason almost always cited by cops for killing drug suspects. 
Women hold families together, Conti said, so it will be inevitable for other members of the family to join their mothers or sisters in this fight.
""To WoManlaban, you bring in your entire family into your struggle as well,” Conti said. “When a woman fights, she fights not only for herself but for others, and she brings in others into the fight as well."" – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippine – An activist priest found himself the target of a death squad he closely followed and documented most of his life. 
In a blog post on Sunday, August 26, Father Amado Picardal narrated how the threats he had gotten for years materialized in the last few months as he lived “a quiet life as a hermit” in Southern Philippines. 
“Two weeks ago, I almost became a victim of extrajudicial killing and the 4th priest to be killed under the Duterte regime had I stuck to my routine,” he wrote. 
Picardal said he got information that on the afternoon of August 11, about 6 men on board 3 motorcycles “with full-faced helmets” stationed themselves near the entrance of the monastery he frequented in Cebu. It was usually the time he would go out, following his usual routine. 
“Had I gone out, there would have been no escape for me,” he wrote. “I recognized their modus operandi – that’s what I learned from a former member of the Davao Death Squad when we were documenting the extrajudicial killings years before.”  
“It was a close call, I thank God for protecting me,” the priest added.  
Three Catholic priests have been killed under President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. (READ: More Catholics outraged by killings of priests) 
Father Richmond Nilo, a 43-year-old priest in Nueva Ecija, was killed last June 2018. Murdered before him were Father Marcelito Paez, a 72-year-old priest also from Nueva Ecija, and 37-year-old Father Mark Ventura of Cagayan. 
Just last July, a gunman was killed in a shootout outside the Archbishop's Residence in Cebu City. He was allegedly looking for Archbishop Jose Palma. 
Years fighting the DDS
Picardal’s work involving the call for justice for victims of extrajudicial killings may have been the reason for his being targeted. 
As part of the Coalition Against Summary Executions (Case), Picardal was able to document the killings allegedly carried out by the Davao Death Squad (DDS) when Rodrigo Duterte was mayor. He was based in Davao City from 1977 to 1981 and from 1995 to 2011. 
The DDS is claimed to be responsible for the deaths of at least 1,000 people. The group was allegedly overseen by then mayor Duterte, according to several whistleblowers. He, however, has denied this.

Picardal was among the main sources of several groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW), as they reported on these extrajudicial killings. (READ: What ever happened to the Davao Death Squad investigations?)
The priest, however, is not sure who ordered his hit – whether it was the President himself or “some zealous henchman trying to please him” – as all he knows is that a death squad is determined to kill him. 
“Whatever happens  to me – whether the order came from him or not – the blame will be placed on him for under this regime the culture of death has claimed the lives of over 25,000 people,” Picardal wrote. 
“This regime has nothing to gain in creating a martyr so those behind the project should think twice before carrying out their evil plan,” he added.
Hermit life on hold
As several priests and staff of the monastery have noticed that the unidentified men still lingered for several days after August 11, Picardal was advised to “move to a more secure location and avoid public exposure.” 
He, however, wrote he “always knew"" his ""life would be at risk” but that he would not make himself an easy target. 
“I have decided to temporarily vacate my hermitage up in the mountain and continue to spend my life of silence, solitude, prayer and writing in a more secure location,” Picardal wrote, adding that he hopes to go back to the mountains soon. 
In March 2018, Picardal embarked on what he called the last phase of his life which includes “a life of solitude, silence, and prayer” as a hermit in the mountains. 
His hermitage plans have been temporarily put on hold as the threats against his life mount, he wrote. (READ: One last bike trip for the fearless Father Picx) – Rappler.com

""Maraming namatay dito, totoo 'yan, but prove na ako ang pumatay at kung sino,"" said Duterte on Tuesday, September 20, during an event in Davao City.
Though he did not name De Lima explicitly, he spoke of a ""Delilah,"" a nickname he has used before to refer to her.
""Si Delilah, 1,000. Sabihin ko sa kanya (I'll tell her), name the 10th victim. Isang question ko lang (I just have one question): so there have been about 500, who was the guy, the 500th who was killed and on what day and how it was done?"" said Duterte.
The President even invited witnesses to go to Davao City so he can cross-examine them.
""Pumunta sila dito, ako ang mag cross-examine sa kanila (They go here so I can cross-examine them). Who was the first victim? Who was the second? What was the name? Where did it happen?"" he said.
Fault of 'enemies'
Duterte claimed his ""enemies"" in Davao City are responsible for portraying him as behind the extrajudicial killings.
""Meron dito, mga kalaban ko for whatever reason – kung sino pumatay, it does not really matter – kukunan ng picture and then it was made into a folder with so many folders there, victims of crimes against persons, nasali lahat doon,"" he said.
(Here I have enemies who, for whatever reason – it does not really matter who killed them – they will take a picture of the body and then it was made into a folder, victims of crimes against persons, all were included there.)
Duterte said he chose to respond to these past accusations with sarcasm.
""'Napaka gago naman ninyo. Eh kung talagang killer ako, I've been mayor here 23 years, 'yan lang ipakita ninyo sa akin? Karami kong tinapon diyan sa Samal Island na Davao Gulf 'yan lang nakita mo?' I raised it to the level of sarcasm,"" he said.
('You are insane. If I were really a killer, I've been mayor here for 23 years, that's all you can show? I've dumped so many bodies in Samal Island, Davao Gulf.' I raised it to the level of sarcasm.)
But Duterte admitted he has ordered the deaths of certain criminals. Previously, he had already admitted to ordering that criminals be shot if they posed a threat to law enforcers.
""Sinabi ko, umalis kayo dito if you're into drugs, murder for hire. Umalis kayo kasi 'pag hindi, papatayin ko kayo and in the process marami akong pinatay upon my direction, walang problema 'yan,"" he said.
(I said, get out if you're into drugs, murder for hire. Get out because if you don't, I'll kill you and in the process I had many killed, no problem there.)
Just threats?
Duterte also cautioned people from equating his colorful threats against criminals to actual acts of extrajudicial executions.
Specifically, he criticized members of the European Parliament for using his threats as proof that he is behind the recent spate of extrajudicial killings.
""Putang ina ka, istorya mo lang 'yan. Kung ginawa ko, ibang storya 'yan,"" he said. (Son of a whore, that's just your story. If I really did it, that's another story.)
Simply threatening criminals is not a crime, Duterte added.
""Look at these idiots, they’re using a phrase, a narrative of my speeches before threatening criminals. Now let me ask you stupid lawyers of the other countries, is there a law in the Philippines that would make it illegal for a mayor, president, or governor to threaten criminals?"" he said.
Duterte chose to issue his challenge to De Lima the day after she was ousted as chair of the Senate committee on justice. As such, she will not be presiding over future hearings on extrajudicial killings.
Senators who voted to oust her said she was too ""anti-administration"", thus supposedly compromising the impartiality of the investigation.
Senator Richard Gordon, the new justice committee chairperson, has promised an objective investigation.
Duterte's challenge also comes on the first day of a House probe into De Lima's alleged involvement in the Bilibid prison drug trade. De Lima claimed the probe, launched by Duterte's allies in the House, is meant to discredit her. – Rappler.com

Police Officer 2 Jhaymar Espedido, Senior Police Officer 4 Wilson Villegas, Senior Police Officer 3 Noel Malabayabas, and Senior Police Officer 2 Bryan Nobo of the Agdangan Police in Quezon face a complaint of frustrated murder filed at the Office of the Ombudsman Thursday, November 29.
The 4 cops also face complaints of grave misconduct and grave irregularity in the performance of duty, while their station chief, Inspector Wilson Mansion, was filed with a complaint for gross neglect of duty.
Roger Herrero, who was shot in the head and sustained a broken jaw, is recuperating at the hospital. An online fundraising initiative by journalist Ezra Acayan gathered donations to help Herrero with hospital bills. 
The complaint
According to the National Bureau of Investigation, “claims and facts” by the policemen “do not jibe” with current evidence.
The policemen claimed that they were responding to a distress call evening of November 1 by a certain Rommel Supilinas, who claimed Herrero robbed him at gunpoint.
The policemen said they hunted down the suspect – Herrero – but that the victim fired his gun first. Herrero, who the cops said fled towards the bushes, allegedly engaged the cops in a firefight. Herrero would be found later in a hospital in nearby Atimonan town.
Supilinas, however, did not show up for NBI questioning.
Residents of Barangay Binagbag, where the alleged gunfight happened, told the NBI that “no firefight occurred in their area, much less heard gunshots on the night of November 1.""
A barangay official was named as a witness for a certificate of inventory which states a .38 caliber revolver was found by the police, but the NBI said the certificate was not signed by the issuing person.
Victim’s version
The complaint to the NBI was filed by Herrero’s common-law wife and his sister.
According to them, Herrero said he was asked by a friend named Franklin Pareja to meet and go to the barrio of Laboy. When they got there, Herrero said Pareja ran off, leaving him to be picked up by men on board a car.
Herrero said he was immediately handcuffed, and that he recognized his abductors as policemen from their town. He heard one cop called by the name “Sir Espidido” later identified as Police Office 2 Jhaymar Espedido.
Herrero said he was interrogated by cops on alleged robberies.
“After hearing the abductors say that Pareja had admitted to them his involvement in crimes, he thought it best to admit his involvement with Pareja. He then realized that Pareja had betrayed him,” the NBI said in its complaint to the Ombudsman.
Herrero said when they reached a bridge in Atimonan, they all got off the car where the cops led him to a grassy portion of the road. Herrero said the cops told him to start praying.
“Sensing that something bad will be done unto him, he pleaded that his life be spared for the sake of his young children, but as it is, he was shot in the head close range. He dropped to the ground and was left for dead,” the NBI said.
Herrero regained consciousness and managed to walk until a group of young men took him to a nearby hospital. Thinking he would soon die, he wrote “Sir Spidido” on a piece of paper and the word “salvaging” (a term that had been used in the Philippines as execution) and penned goodbye to his wife and sister.
Giving merit to the testimonies of witnesses and Herrero, the NBI said “absent any evidence showing any reason or motive for complainant and witnesses to perjure, the logical conclusion is that no such improver motive exists.”

Practically every day for the most part of the year, TV footage, online posts, and newspaper photos showed blood and grief as policemen raided poor villages and shanties to implement the Duterte administration's war on drugs. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Despite official data and eyewitness accounts, the government has repeatedly denied that the dead are victims of extrajudicial killings.
This state of denial has come in many forms, such as official declarations – like the one made before the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in September – that the deaths from police operations ""are not extrajudicial killings""; the rejection of calls by United Nations member-states to conduct a thorough and impartial probe; and the intimidation of local and foreign human rights advocates.
At the slightest hint of intending to investigate the drug war, international organizations and personalities were demonized by President Rodrigo Duterte. He cursed and threatened to slap United Nations Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard and warned to put on the immigration blacklist US lawmakers who have been pushing for an independent probe into alleged police abuses.
The government also declared it would reject aid from nations that have expressed concern over the killings. 
Parallel to these frontal attacks were diplomatic efforts made by Duterte's advisers, such as Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano and Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
Before state-parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC), where a Filipino lawyer filed a ""communication"" against Duterte, Roque said that the administration would ""reassess"" its commitment to it should the court violate the principle of complementarity enshrined in its founding treaty. (The principle requires the ICC to step in only if it's been proven that a concerned country has not been willing to act on the issues hurled against it.)
Government officials have also issued broad commitments to bring to court anyone found to violate criminal laws.
Denial's consequences
Latest government numbers show that 3,993 suspected drug personalities were killed in police anti-drug operations since Duterte became president in June 2016. Families of victims said policemen shot defenseless suspects. (READ: The Fifth Man)
Ellecer Carlos of the In Defense of Human Rights and Dignity Movement (iDEFEND) said the administration's dismissal of any human rights probe is proof that it won't ""accept any interference.” But this has consequences, he said.
Carlos noted that aid-giving states have ""considerations that will always depend on how the government treats its most vulnerable, how it respects, protects and fulfills human rights."" He added, ""There will be states which may now think twice about providing support to the Philippine National Police because they know that the funding will just go to waste.”  
As signatory to various international human rights treaties, the government is “duty-bound” to follow the guidelines and implement appropriate measures to investigate and prosecute those responsible, he said.
Non-acceptance of the criticisms and recommendations by other countries regarding the human rights situation “does not relieve the government at all of its obligations and accountability before the community of nations,” according to lawyer Perfecto Caparas. 
 “At all times, government remains to be the duty-bearer primarily responsible to respect, protect and fulfill all the economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights of all people, who are the rights-holders,” he added. 
No to executive branch's investigation
Human rights groups and advocates said the situation calls for investigation by parties outside the executive branch of government. (READ: Supreme Court asked to order probe into all EJK cases)
Yet, the local constitutional body tasked to protect human rights and prevent its abuse, has also been emasculated. The Commission on Human Rights is barred from accessing important legal documents such as case folders of drug war deaths. 
Outside the Philippines, the UN has various mechanisms and tools to hold countries and leaders accountable. 
The UN Human Rights Council can unilaterally begin its own investigation of the reported extrajudicial killings here, according to John Fisher, director of Human Rights Watch Geneva, citing the example of Myanmar and the prosecution of the Rohingya Muslims there. 
“One way or another, there needs to be an investigation, there needs to be accountability and if the government is sincere in saying that it is open to that kind of scrutiny, then we expect them to be open to that kind of probe,” Fisher said.  
He expressed the hope that the government would eventually cooperate with an international team – should the time come. (READ: No extrajudicial killings in PH? World 'not fooled,' says HRW)
“If the government claims that they are not doing anything, why would they not want to cooperate?” Fisher said. “The fact that they have been so resistant to independent scrutiny suggests that they are well aware that the killings of the so-called war on drugs are in violation of international standards and that in fact don't want what's happening to come to life,” he added.
What local groups can do 
Carlos said that any move by UN agencies and experts is “very dependent” on the activities of human rights groups in the Philippines. (READ: 'Demonizing' human rights in the first year of Duterte)
These local groups have been the center of Duterte’s tirades. He has threatened to shoot advocates if they “obstruct justice” even as rabid supporters called for their death. “The government fostered systemic impunity and engendered routine disregard for the rule of law makes the work for human rights defenders very challenging and risky,” Carlos said. 
While it is a tiring and taxing battle, the human rights campaign compels groups involved to exhaust all legall means to exact accountability from public institutions and officials.
If these means are exhausted and impunity persists, then this would be a ""key requirement for various international mechanisms to kick in,” Carlos said.
One example of an international mechanism is the ICC, which can try Duterte over crimes against humanity or “serious violations committed as part of a large-scale attack against any civilian population.”
In April 2017, lawyer Jude Sabio filed with the ICC a 78-page “communication” entitled, ""The Situation of Mass Murder in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte: The Mass Murderer.” Additional documents were filed by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano.
The filing is just the first step as  the Office of the Prosecutor still has to decide whether the complaint has basis. (READ: What challenges will complaint vs Duterte face before ICC?) 
But the ""decisive arena” of the human rights struggle is in the domestic front, Caparas stressed. “Surely, our people will continue defending the democratic space we still have at the moment,"" he said. – Rappler.com

Justice for EJK victims,,"MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – For Christmas 2017, lawmakers want justice for the families of victims of extrajudicial killings in the country.
Detained opposition senator Leila de Lima said she wants an end to the extrajudicial killings under President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody drug war, which has killed thousands.
""Christmas is indeed one of the most anticipated holidays in the Philippines where Filipino families traditionally spend time together over good food and good stories. But may we also remember that Christmas this year, as with last year, brings sadness and grief to many of our countrymen who will not be with their loved ones killed in Duterte's drug war,"" De Lima said in a statement.
Aside from this, De Lima added that she wishes to be vindicated from the drug charges against her, which she maintains were fabricated.
Minority Senator Francis Pangilinan also called on the public to reflect on the hardships many families had to face this year.
""Maraming nawalan ng pamilya at kaibigan sa madugong kampanya na nagdulot ng sakit at lungkot para sa mga biktima nito. Marami ang magdiriwang nang malayo sa mga tahanang ipinagkaila sa kanilang mabalikan. Marami ang magdiriwang nang mag-isa,"" Pangilinan said.
(Many lost their families and friends in the bloody drug war that has caused pain and sadness. Many are celebrating Christmas away from home and alone.)
""Ngunit kahit na nakakalungkot, ay kinakatawan nila ang puso ng lumalabang Pilipino: Tayo ay isang matatag na mamamayan, isang bansang laging nakakakita ng pag-asa at pag-ibig sa kabila ng mga suliranin. Walang duda na makakakita sila ng paraan para salubungin ang pagsilang ni Kristo nang may ngiti sa kanilang mga mukha,"" he added.
(Even if it's sad, they embody the heart of the Filipino that keeps on fighting. We are a resilient people, a country that keeps on seeing hope and love amid struggles. There is no doubt that they would also find happiness welcoming the birth of Christ.)
Peace, unity
Senator Grace Poe, for her part, wished for an ""outpouring of love and compassion"" for the poor and downtrodden, including the families of slain victims. (READ: For families of EJK victims, Christmas will no longer be the same)
""Let the Christmas season be an outpouring of love and compassion for the families in shelters due to fighting and calamities; for the relatives crying out for justice for their killed kin; for our men in uniform in the field; for our OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) in faraway places; and for the zestful youth, especially those who make use of social media to make their voices heard,"" she said.
Poe and Senator Joel Villanueva also called for peace and unity among Filipinos.
""This season is an invitation for us to reinforce the ties as Filipinos, woven from our shared hopes and aspirations of a progressive future for all. Let's spread love, not hatred. Let our faith grow stronger towards justice, reconciliation, peace, and compassion. These are the greatest gifts we can give to our fellow Filipinos,"" Poe said.
""Amidst the challenges our nation faced over the past year, we are grateful for all the tremendous opportunities that God Almighty has bestowed on the Filipino people. This holiday season, I pray for unity and peace in our nation and may the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ bring new hope for the Philippines,"" Villanueva said.
Meanwhile, Senator Loren Legarda called on the public to reflect and be grateful for the year.
""The Yuletide season is more than just a joyful celebration. It is also a time to reflect and be grateful. As we end this year and welcome a new one, let us appreciate the experiences we had and the people who have helped us turn our adversities into triumphs, misgivings into wisdom, and doubts into hope,"" she said. 
Senator Francis Pangilinan also urged Filipinos to remember families who went through a lot this 2017.
""Maraming nawalan ng pamilya at kaibigan sa madugong kampanya na nagdulot ng sakit at lungkot para sa mga biktima nito. Marami ang magdiriwang nang malayo sa mga tahanang ipinagkaila sa kanilang mabalikan. Marami ang magdiriwang nang mag-isa,"" he said in a statement sent on Christmas eve.
(Many lost family and friends to the bloody campaign that caused pain and sadness to its victims. Many will spend Christmas away from homes they cant return to. Many will celebrate it alone.)
Pangilinan still expressed hope this Christmas, noting that Filipinos are strong – a nation that always sees hope and love despite problems.
""Walang duda na makakakita sila ng paraan para salubungin ang pagsilang ni Kristo nang may ngiti sa kanilang mga mukha. Ito ang tunay na diwa ng Pasko, at kung ano ang 'sinisimbolo ng pagsilang ni Kristo: ligaya, pag-asa, at kaligtasan.""

MANILA, Philippines – As couples celebrated Valentine's Day on Wednesday, February 14, families of the victims of the government's war on drugs gathered in a mass at Sto. Niño Parish Church in Caloocan City to offer prayers to their slain loved ones.
Many of the bereaved parents, widows, and orphans who attended come from Bagong Silang in Caloocan, one of the most gravely affected communities in Metro Manila in terms of the fatalities.
""As the beginning of Lent also coincides with Valentine’s Day, the season’s call for recollection brought the families together for a meaningful remembrance of their lost loved ones,"" said the CSO-CHR Consultative Caucus on Human Rights in a press statement.

""Deaths caused by EJK causes greater pain for these families: even as they search for justice, many of these families continue to struggle with poverty and the trauma of violence.""
One of the most controversial cases in the community was a case of a vigilante killing, dubbed ""the Caloocan massacre,"" on December 28, 2016, that left 7 people dead, including a pregnant woman and 3 minors.

The 3 men were reported missing one after the other since October 8.
Still fresh in the memory of Iba residents was the case of similarly 3 missing persons whose dead bodies were later dumped in one shallow grave near a river in San Felipe, Zambales three months ago.
Media here tried to coordinate with the head of the Iba Municipal Police Office, Chief Inspector Julius Caesar Noveno, but he refused to answer questions because he said he was busy attending a conference. 
Relatives have been posting on social media about the latest missing men, who all disappeared in the span of one week this month. 
First reported missing on October 8 was Jonash Alba, 30, of Acayan St., Barangay Palanginan. Alba’s wife, Danna Belles, said her husband went out to buy cigarettes but has not returned since.
She said Alba was wearing a gray T-shirt with black sleeves and had red ball cap when he left the house.
On October 13, James Camba, 39, a water refiller, of Purok 4, was reported missing in Barangay Palanginan. Reports said Camba had no known enemies in the neighborhood.

""Sigurado ako may sinalvage, sigurado ako diyan, and we will investigate,"" he said on Thursday, August 4, during an environment summit in Davao City.
(I am sure there are salvage victims, I am sure of that, and we will investigate.)
Duterte spent a bulk of his speech talking about his administration's campaign against illegal drugs. He had been explaining how some 470,000 drug addicts have already surrendered and how the fight must be sustained to save the Philippines from being a ""fractured country.""
While ""salvage"" in English means ""to save"", in Filipino it is also slang for summary killings or deaths that occur under mysterious circumstances.
While around 300 drug suspects have been killed in police operations, there have also been many drug-related deaths in the past months that happened mysteriously. 
In some cases, bodies were found in alleyways or side streets with signs identifying them, supposedly, as a drug addict, pusher, or drug lord.
In others, persons who did not fit the profile of a drug suspect were shot at. Relatives of these victims insisted they were just at the wrong place, at the wrong time. (READ: Drug user? No, Oman was a good son and Lauren Rosales: Don't remember her as the girl killed in a jeep)
'Suspects fought back'
After saying he would have such cases investigated, Duterte defended the police in cases when drug suspects were killed during their operations.
Duterte, echoing the police, insisted that the drug suspects fought back thereby forcing the police to use deadly force.
""'Yang ganoon, may baril talaga 'yan, at maniwala ka diyan sa mga pulis na 'yan,"" he said. (They really have guns, believe what the police say.)
Duterte said police are placed in a very dangerous situation when facing a suspect whose brains are addled with drugs.
""Lumalaban talaga 'yan, kaya lang siyempre ang pulis, ang kalaban niya bangag, cannot even shoot straight,"" he said. 
(They really fight, and of course the police, the enemy is not in his right mind and cannot even shoot straight.)
The President even said he learned the previous night that a chief of police had been shot during an anti-illegal drugs operation.
He said he plans to pass by the hospital to visit the policeman before going to his office in the Malacañang of the South in the Panacan district.
Duterte's war on drugs has earned criticism from human rights groups who allege it has encouraged the killing of drug suspects without due process.
The police said all drug suspects killed during their operations fought back. The rise in number of extrajudicial killings that accompanied the war on drugs is due to drug syndicates killing each other, said the police. – Rappler.com

“In order to realize our full potential as Filipinos we must be equally relentless in pursuing social justice and the rule of law,” the group said.

Fernando, a political detainee in the 80s serving a second term in the municipal council of Lezo, Aklan, succumbed to gunshot wounds -- one to the neck, the other to the head. A bullet pierced through his helmet. And the perpetrators fled. 
The killing bore the imprint of impunity which characterized the human rights situation during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. But it happened during the term of President Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III, a few days before his first State of the Nation Address in 2010. 
Fernando was the first reported victim of extrajudicial killing under the current administration. Ironically, during the 2010 elections, he ran under the President's party.

UN human rights review
The Philippine Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said it investigated the incident and that police filed case number INV 101101573 in a local court in 2010. Warrants of arrests were issued but were never served. 
Lamenting that his family has not gotten justice in the country, Fernando's son, Ernan, took his father's case to the United Nations (UN), which is reviewing the human rights records of its member-countries from May 29 to June 1.
""We came here to Geneva to tell the international community that impunity and injustice are continuing in the Philippines,"" Ernan told human rights organizations and representatives of foreign missions now gathering in Switzerland for the second Universal Periodic Review (UPR).
According to the Philippine UPR Watch, Fernando's case is one of the 76 cases of extrajudicial killings that took place under the Aquino government. The group also reported 9 cases of enforced disappearances.   
However, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, who led a 29-member delegation in Geneva, reported to the UN that the Aquino government has undertaken actions that ""resulted in a dramatic decrease"" in reported incidents of extrajudicial killings.
During the first cycle of the rights review in 2008, the Philippines, voluntarily committed ""to maintain the momentum on addressing killings of activists and media professionals.""
""The wheels of the Philippine justice system are indeed moving, with all verified cases either under investigation or already in the courts,"" De Lima assured the UN body conducting the second cycle of the review.
The CHR, which monitors the government's compliance with its human rights obligations, reported only 24 cases of murder, frustrated murder, killing and salvaging from July 2010 to March 2012.
Enforce measures to end impunity
According to De Lima, Task Force Usig, a special unit under the Philippine National Police, has independently verified that incidents of extrajudicial killings and torture have clearly declined under the Aquino administration. 
De Lima also stressed that the Aquino government condemns these crimes and that it is committed to resolving verified cases and bringing perpetrators to justice, whether they are state or non-state actors.
However, Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said, ""It is not enough for the Philippines to merely acknowledge concerns about continuing abuses and impunity raised by UN member states.” 
“The Aquino administration needs to implement enforceable and time-bound measures to end abuses and ensure that those who commit them are prosecuted,” Pearson added. 
More than 300 complaints on human rights violations allegedly committed by the police and military between July 2010 to March 2012 were documented by the CHR.
States grill PH on rights record
On the eve of the review, Ernan said he had spoken to different country missions in the UN and hoped they would ask tough questions of the Philippine government. He was not dissapointed. A total of 67 States participated in the discussion, raising issues and posing a series of recommendations to the Philippine delegation. 
What dissapointed Ernan and human rights advocates observing the review was the government's selective presentation of information and emphasis on the treaties it signed.
""The GPH report drowns the essentials on the failure of the Aquino administration to improve or change the human rights situation in PH. These facts remain -- EJKs, torture, enforced disappearances continue to be committed with impunity, with efforts to seek accountability being solely shouldered by the victims themselves and their kin -- Karapatan spokesperson Cristina Palabay said.
""These facts were glossed over by the gloating emphasis of the GPH on their long-overdue obligations to international rights,"" added Palabay, who is a member of the Philippine UPR Watch delegation in Switzerland. 
De Lima reported that the Philippines ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Protocol 1 Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which was a particular recommendation during the 2008 review. 
The Philippines is now a signatory to 8 international human rights treaties.
This is the 2nd time that the UN's Human Rights Council is conducting the lone international rights review since it was formed in 2008. The human rights body is expected to adopt the report of the UPR Working Group on the Philippines this Friday evening, June 1 (Manila time). -- Rappler.com

The family and friends of Kim Lester Ramos trooped to the Marikina City Hall of Justice on Monday morning, wearing the same white shirts and carrying the same tarpaulins that called for justice when Kim was buried in October. Ramos was the 23-year-old construction worker killed by Soller after Ramos allegedly tried to snatch the cop’s gun – a narrative fiercely contested by members of Ramos’ quiet Marikina community.
Ramos’ father, Norman, led the crowd and filed the complaint, backing up his claims with “5 to 7 witnesses” according to their lawyers from the Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment through Alternative Legal Services or IDEALS.
Lauro Lagarde, Kim Lester Ramos’ childhood friend who was present during the shooting, accused Soller of frustrated murder for shooting Lagarde at the hip in the same encounter. Lagarde then played dead, and when he opened his eyes briefly, he said he saw Soller shoot his friend at the back of the head point-blank.
After the case received extensive media coverage, Soller was relieved from his post in the Marikina City Police office as an intelligence agent and placed in a holding unit, effectively putting him on ""floating status.""

Why this matters: Many families have stepped forward to tell the public that cops in the Philippine National Police (PNP) have killed their relatives and friends in anti-drug operations, but only a few have decided to formalize their accusations into a legal complaint.
With the complaint submitted, Norman Ramos hopes that his son is afforded the same verdict as the case of Kian delos Santos, the 17-year-old Caloocan boy who was killed by cops then painted in police reports as a drug runner.
“Sana manalo kami kasi sinungaling naman ang pulis na yan…Bakit niya binaril ang anak ko sa ulo eh tumatakbo na nga eh (I hope we win in this case. Why did he shoot my son in the head even if he was already running?),” Norman Ramos told reporters in an interview after the filing of the complaint.
Ramos and Lagarde’s lawyers have declined to share the complaints as they wanted to keep their witnesses confidential to keep them safe from harassment.
Kim Lester Ramos is among at least 5,500 killed suspects whom cops have accused of “fighting back” in anti-drug operations. Human rights groups, however, estimate the kill tally to have reached over 30,000, including killings inspired by President Rodrigo Duterte’s so-called war on drugs. – Rappler.com

This claim is a lie. 
Evoking images of Michelangelo's Pietà, the photo was taken by award-winning photojournalist Raffy Lerma, and was published on PDI's front page on July 24, 2016. 
The photo came under fire after Malacañang said on Saturday, October 21, that Siaron was killed by a member of a drug syndicate, not the police. Based on this claim by the government, propagandists and trolls attacked PDI and Lerma for supposedly publishing a piece of ""fake news."" 
PDI, however, never said in its original photo caption that the Philippine National Police (PNP) killed Siaron. 
What PDI said was that Siaron was killed by ""motorcycle-riding gunmen.""
Here is PDI's caption for that photo on July 24, 2016: ""A weeping Jennelyn Olaires hugs partner Michael Siaron, 30, a pedicab driver and alleged drug pusher, who was shot and killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen near Pasay Rotonda on Edsa. He was one of six killed in drug-related incidents in Pasay and Manila yesterday.""

BANNER PHOTO. The caption of this Inquirer photo on July 24, 2016, is as follows: 'A weeping Jennelyn Olaires hugs partner Michael Siaron, 30, a pedicab driver an alleged drug pusher, who was shot and killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen near Pasay Rotonda on Edsa. He was one of six killed in drug-related incidents in Pasay and Manila yesterday.' Screenshot from www.inquirer.
net
The copy of PDI's page one on July 24, 2016, where the photo appears, is also accessible on the PDI website. 
A similar photo, shot by award-winning photojournalist Noel Celis, was published by Agence France-Presse. 
The Agence France-Presse photo came with this caption: ""This photo taken on July 23, 2016 shows Jennilyn Olayres (centre) hugging the dead body of her partner Michael Siaron who was shot by unidentified gunman (sic) and left with a cardboard sign with a message 'I'm a pusher' along a street in Manila.""
'Fake news' from Tiglao
Still, former journalist Rigoberto Tiglao wrote a Manila Times column on October 23 this year, titled, ""Fakest 'fake news' was viral Inquirer photo.""
""Siaron, the newspaper claimed,* was executed by the police in the course of President Duterte's war against illegal drugs,"" according to Tiglao, former spokesman of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, an ally of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Tiglao's column came with the following footnote: ""To be accurate, the PDI in the article that accompanied the photo did not blame the police, reporting only that the pedicab driver was killed by 'two men riding on a motorcycle.' It was the photographer Lerma who would write four days later, referring to the victim: 'It was the third extrajudicial killing of suspected drug pushers that I covered on the graveyard shift last week.' Extrajudicial killing is defined as executions by the police or other state agents of suspected criminals without the sanction of a court.""
Lerma wrote about this ""third extrajudicial killing of suspected drug pushers"" in an opinion piece for the Inquirer. While opinion writers, like Tiglao himself, do not represent the official stance of their newspapers, Tiglao nevertheless said it was the Inquirer that ""claimed"" Siaron was killed by the police.
In his opinion piece, Lerma never said the PNP killed Siaron, as Tiglao falsely claimed. (READ: Tiglao and his fever swamp of conspiracy theories)
Abella, Cayetano, Andanar
Like Tiglao, officials of the Duterte administration released statements on the Pietà photo based on the wrong premise.
Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said on Saturday, ""The relentless attribution of such killings to police operations was both premature and unfair to law abiding enforcement officers who risk life and limb to stop the proliferation of illegal drugs in our society."" 
Days later, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a post by state-run PTV, ""The identification of the suspected killer of Michael Siaron, also referred to as the Pietà drug suspect, vindicates the members of the PNP and other law enforcement agencies who were portrayed as merciless killers."" 
In an interview on Wednesday, October 25, Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano also cited the Pietà image in discussing a recent meeting with European Union officials.
""We're also telling them, look at the alleged Pietà picture. It already went around the world, it already went to international organizations, and they condemned the PNP, and even if you look at the survey, mayroong hindi naniniwala sa PNP dahil sa mga iyon (there are some who don't believe in the PNP because of those things),"" Cayetano said.
It was in the same interview that Cayetano backtracked on his earlier statement that the Philippines was rejecting all forms of grants from the EU.
Duterte's defeated running mate said that if critics ""only waited for the investigation,"" they would have found out that a ""drug lord,"" not the PNP, had Siaron killed.
Duterte himself said, however, that 9,000 policemen, or 4 in every 100 cops, use or sell illegal drugs.  
Policemen have also been suspected as behind vigilante-style drug war killings across the Philippines.
In October 2016, two young police officers – Senior Inspector Magdalino Pimentel Jr and Inspector Markson Almeranez  – were accused of gunning down Citizens Crime Watch regional director Zenaida Luz in front of her house in Oriental Mindoro. 
Pimentel supposedly wore a ""bonnet and hoodie jacket"" while Almeranez used a ""facemask and a wig to disguise himself,"" according to the Manila Bulletin. The Bulletin story was titled, ""2 PNP officials unmasked as riding-in-tandem killers.""
Months later, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David denounced vigilantes as ""termites"" and ""new Judases,"" as he questioned why the PNP has failed to catch these unidentified killers. – Rappler.com

Families seek justice for the deaths of their loved ones.

MANILA, Philippines – Families left behind by people killed in the Philippine government's bloody anti-drug campaign took their quest for justice to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
On Tuesday, August 28, the families who convened under the Rise Up for Life and for Rights network called on the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor to indict and eventually convict President Rodrigo Duterte for thousands of extrajudicial killings.
In a 50-page complaint addressed to Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, the families ""call for an end to madness and for President Duterte, who has likened himself to one of the most evil men in history, to be brought before the ICC and be held to account for crimes against humanity.""
""The extrajudicial killings, mass arrests, roving searches, and other inhumane acts in the Philippines under the auspices, order, command, and policy of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte threaten the core principles of humanity itself, subsuming individual victim experiences, and even state borders,"" the families told the ICC.
Aside from Rise Up, relatives of 6 victims are also named in the document – Irma Locasia, Dennise David, Maria Lozano, Mariel Sabangan, Normita Lopez, and Purisima Dacumos. They are represented by the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL).
Hoping for progress at ICC
This is the latest complaint sent to the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor, which began a preliminary examination of the anti-drug campaign back in February. The office, at this stage, is determining if there is sufficient evidence to establish that the case falls under its jurisdiction.
Duterte, however, ordered the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC last March. This move is now the subject of oral arguments on Tuesday, August 28, at the Supreme Court (SC), after minority senators challenged its validity in May.
But the outcome of the petition at the SC would have no bearing on the preliminary examination at the ICC. Article 127 of the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding document, states that any investigation or criminal proceeding that started before the withdrawal takes effect would still continue.
The timeline of the ICC's preliminary examination is unknown, but NUPL chairperson Neri Colmenares hopes it would be completed soon. (READ: ICC's track record and what it means for Duterte and the PH)
""We don't know when the ICC will move forward, but we're hoping this will happen before dumami pa ang mga mamatay (more people are killed),"" Colmenares said.
""Malakas ang influence ni Pangulong Duterte na hindi mabigyan ng katarungan sa local courts ang mga biktima (President Duterte's influence is so far-reaching that local courts would not be able to give justice to the victims).""
'More than our loved ones'
The families' quest for justice has now gone beyond their sons and husbands.
According to Dennise David, whose son John Jezreel David was killed in January 2017, he doesn't want other families to suffer their ordeal.
""Ayaw kong maramdaman ng ibang magulang iyong naramdaman ko. Gusto ko matigil na itong pamamaslang na ito kasi hindi makatarungan,"" he said.
(I don't want other parents to feel what I feel. I want these killings to stop because it isn't right.)
John Jezreel's case is now pending before the Office of the Ombudsman. Since filing the case in September 2017, Dennise has left his home and fled to outside Metro Manila, sacrificing his livelihood and time with his family.
Dennise said: ""Kailangan natin gawin iyon para makamit natin iyong katarungan. Hindi ako nagtatago kasi takot ako, proteksiyon rin ito para sa sarili ko kasi kung nawala ako, sino'ng lalaban para sa anak ko?""
(I have to do what I need to do to achieve justice. I'm not hiding because I'm afraid, I'm hiding to protect myself because if something happens to me, who will fight for my son?) – Rappler.com

""Manuel is Randall Echanis,"" Perez told Rappler in a text message. 
The ""Manuel"" that Perez referred to was Manuel Santiago, the name on one of the identification cards found by the police in the crime scene. Cruz did not explain why Echanis was using a different name.
Echanis was known  as an agrarian reform advocate. He was credited for his work in helping craft the the Genuine Agrarian Reform Bill (GARB).
Echanis also served as political consultant for the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). He is the 4th NDF political consultant to be killed, after Sotero Llamas, Randy Malayao, and Julius Giron.
The Quezon City Police District (QCPD) earlier reported that the only sensational case in their area that took place the same time as Echanis' murder was the stabbing incident that killed 2 men in Novaliches.
However, the QCPD insisted that none of the victims was Echanis, saying that they were a certain Manuel Santiago and a certain Louie Tagapia.  Manuel Santiago was Echanis after all.
Perez said there has been no correction made with regards to the identity of Louie Tagapia.
Initial investigation showed that at 1:35 am on Monday, a witness heard a ""loud noise"" from the 2nd floor of  No. 14 Petronia Street in Barangay Novaliches, Quezon City. The witness went to check the source of the noise and found the bodies of Echanis and Tagapia.
Without citing a source, police said in their report that around 5 people could have killed Echanis and Tagapia.
The SOCO team recovered  identification cards, a Dell Laptop, a small notebook, 2 USBs and P400 cash.
The investigation of Echanis' killing has been delegated to the QCPD's Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit (CIDU), which usually handles high-profile killings. – Rappler.com

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday, December 11, again rejected allegations that killings being linked to his war on drugs are state-sponsored.
In a speech at the Belenismo sa Tarlac 2016 Awards in Tarlac City, the President denied ever ordering the police or the military to carry out summary executions.
""Ayaw kong pumatay. Nasasaktan akong pumatay ng Pilipino. Ayaw ko, pareho tayo. (I don't want Filipinos to get killed. It's painful for me to see Filipinos dead. I don't want that, like you.) ...Do you think I enjoy [that]?"" Duterte said.
""I do not allow extrajudicial [killings]... We do not do that. It's a dirty job,"" he added. ""At saka para kang hindi lalaki. Talian mo, balutin mo, it's a form of torture, binabalot ng plastik. Hindi trabaho ng pulis 'yan pati sundalo.""
(And it's also as if you're not man enough. Tie up a victim, wrap him in plastic, it's a form of torture, wrapping in plastic. That's not the work of policemen or soldiers.)
The President reiterated that his marching orders are for cops to shoot only if suspects resist arrest or fight back. (READ: Shoot to kill? Duterte's statements on killing drug users)
""Hanapin mo sila, arestuhin mo kung kaya pa, pagka-lumaban at may armas ... that would place the life of the police or military man, pati siya madadamay sa kamatayan, unahan na ninyo. That's my order,"" he said.
(Find the suspects, arrest them, if they fight back and they have weapons that would place the life of the policeman or military man in danger, then fire at them. That's my order.)
More than 5,800 deaths have been linked to the Duterte administration's anti-drug campaign since July 1. Of this figure, around 2,000 have been killed in police operations, while the rest are victims of extrajudicial or vigilante-style killings. (READ: Dela Rosa to Senate: We are not butchers)
""We will, I will address the problems of extrajudicial killing. It is not our job. Maniwala kayo (Believe me). Even before the elections. Please look back in the hands of time and you would notice that marami nang nagpatay-patayan (killings were rampant even then),"" Duterte said. (READ: Duterte: We will investigate mysterious killings)
The President also said he cannot lose momentum in the fight against drugs, despite the criticism being thrown at him. (READ: Duterte hopeful war on drugs 'nearly over')
Senator Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics, earlier dubbed him ""the father of all extrajudicial killings"" and said he was a ""murderer."" De Lima's remarks came after Duterte vowed to protect police officers tagged in the murder of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr, who was linked to drugs by the President himself.
On Saturday, December 10 – International Human Rights Day – human rights activists across the country also condemned what they described as Duterte's ""worsening human rights record.""
""Duterte's remorseless extrajudicial killings in his crusade against drugs is unacceptable... Duterte has been using this campaign to sow fear among the people,"" the League of Filipino Students had said. – Rappler.com

Father Gilbert Billena, spokesperson of the group Rise Up for Life and for Rights, made this call on the eve of All Saints' Day, November 1.
All Saints' Day, also called Undas in the Philippines, is the day for remembering the dead in this predominantly Catholic country. 
Undas this year comes as President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs, which has run for more than a year, has killed more than 14,000 people in both police operations and vigilante-style killings. (READ: Church to hold EDSA march vs killings on November 5)
Billena talked about this in a Mass for victims of drug war killings at San Isidro Labrador Parish in Bagong Silangan, Quezon City, on Tuesday morning, October 31.
Billena explained that even in the Book of Revelations in the Bible, martrys, even though in heaven, still prayed for justice for themselves.
'May katapusan din ang lahat'
The priest said justice for drug war victims – even if not today or tomorrow – is sure to come.
""Alam natin na may katapusan din ang lahat. Katulad noong Martial Law, maraming pinatay at pinaslang, ngunit may katapusan din ang diktadurya. At naniniwala tayo na may katapusan din ang ganitong klaseng pamamaraan at pang-aapi ng estado sa mga mahihirap at mga biktima,"" Billena said.
(We know that there's an end to everything. In the case of Martial Law, when many people were killed, the dictatorship also came to an end. And we believe there will also be an end to this kind of persecution by the state against poor victims.)

MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) is striving to keep up with investigations as the death toll continues to rise two years into President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign.
Latest data obtained by Rappler show that since 2016, the CHR has handled 1,106 drug-related cases with 1,345 victims. Out of this number of cases, 594 stemmed from police operations, while 512 were vigilante-style killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
CHR Spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia admitted their current case load does not represent even half of the reality on the ground, adding that the extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration are ""a new phenomenon"" for the commission. 
""If you are to compare the number of cases [the CHR is handling] to the entire situation, it really pales in comparison and we're very much aware of that,"" De Guia told Rappler. ""In terms of rate and scale, we never did encounter this [many] killings.""
""Masyado na talagang marami (There are really a lot) and we cannot really cope with the sheer number of cases,"" she added.
Anti-drug operations of the Philippine National Police (PNP) claimed the lives of 4,729 suspects between July 1, 2016 and May 15, 2018. But human rights groups estimate that drug war killings have reached almost 20,000. (READ: In the PH drug war, it's likely EJK when...)
All in all, police documents show 33 people have been killed each day since Duterte became president in 2016.  
The problem with the CHR setup 
Created through the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the CHR is mandated to investigate alleged human rights abuses by state actors such as the military or police. (READ: Things to know: Human rights in the Philippines)
But the setup of the CHR as an institution and its lack of manpower hinder it from doing its job as efficiently as possible, especially given the magnitude of the anti-drug campaign, according to De Guia.
""The way we are set up as an institution is not really meant to be as responsive as law enforcement agencies are,"" she explained.
Unlike in the case of the PNP which has a unit in each city or municipality, the CHR has to make do with regional offices, and only 7 to 10 investigators per region.
In response to the Philippine situation during the early months of the Duterte administration, the commission established a task force on extrajudicial killings. It also identified a focal person per region to ensure that investigations into extrajudicial killings move in their jurisdiction.
For major incidents, such as ""one-time, big-time"" operations by police which result in many casualties, the CHR activates a special composite team of investigators pulled in from various regional offices.
It doesn't help that the PNP has so far failed to make good on its promise to efficiently cooperate with the CHR. In fact, police have not given case documents to aid CHR investigations despite several requests from the commission since 2016. (READ: Evading probes? The many times Duterte admin didn't give drug war documents)
""Dati ang daling makakuha ng police reports tapos minsan hindi mo kailangan mag-subpoena o magbigay ng letter minsan. Ngayon, wala ka na makuhanan talaga,"" De Guia said.
(It was so easy to get police reports before that we didn't even have to issue subpoenas or send letters. Now, it's so hard to obtain documents.)
Climate of fear, war on the poor
There are few families filing complaints over the deaths of their loved ones in the anti-drug campaign – another reason behind the low number of cases in the past two years.
According to latest data, 90% of the cases being handled by the CHR since 2016 are motu proprio, or investigations initiated by the commission itself. These incidents are monitored through media reports.
Unfortunately, however, leads sometimes go nowhere as relatives opt not to file a complaint, while some witnesses become uncooperative. The climate of fear hinders families from moving forward.
Filing complaints, according to Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch (HRW), is already ""an act of extreme self-sacrifice"" as victims' families expose themselves to danger.
In fact, the CHR's help desk recorded a significant increase in the number of families seeking assistance when the anti-drug campaign was suspended. 
""Meron talagang impact iyong climate of fear dahil takot sila kasi ang binabangga mo ay pulis. Nagtatanong raw kasi iyong mga pulis na kung saan gagamitin iyong mga documents na hinihingi ng family ng victims. Pahihirapan sila,"" De Guia said.
(The climate of fear has an impact since victims' families are afraid because they're going against the police. The police often ask the families what they intend to do with the documents they're asking for. They're given a hard time.)
But Conde pointed out that victims, who come from lower-income groups, may already have been conditioned that the law will never favor them.
""The fact that many of them have run-ins with the law in the past discourages them from pursuing cases for fear of incriminating themselves, adding to their troubles,"" he said. ""I think the fear for physical safety is just a small part of the problem – the fear for the institutions of justice plays a larger role in all this.""
Intimidating legal process, lack of support system
Aside from the fear of retribution, the entire process of filing and pursuing a case is seen as intimidating. The legal fees, together with other expenses tied to going to and from courts, are too much for the poor.
Human rights lawyer Edre Olalia of the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) pointed out that juggling a legal battle with daily life is not an easy task.
""The poor are preoccupied with sheer daily survival that they cannot afford the added hardship of dealing with a largely slow, tedious, complicated, and even skewed process,"" he told Rappler.
This was echoed by De Guia, but she noted that the CHR has partnered with civil society groups to establish a support system for victims' families.
The commission has also tapped several law organizations such as the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for legal support, as well as the Balay Rehabilitation Center for psychosocial counseling.
The CHR, however, acknowledged that financial aid and other types of assistance during the course of investigation aren't enough, adding that they've lacked post-investigation support. 
""It's a reality na hindi sapat iyong ibibigay na financial assistance namin kasi nawalan ang mga pamilya na ito ng income earner eh (It's a reality that the financial assistance we give won't be enough because these families lost an income earner),"" De Guia explained.
It also does not help, she added, that other government agencies do not have any program to assist victims' families aside from helping with burial expenses. (READ: The cost of dying in Duterte's drug war)
""Ang dali sa amin na i-refer ang victims ng ibang violations sa other government agencies kasi may programa para sa kanila. Kaya lang wala talagang programa ang government para doon sa survivors ng extrajudicial killings, kaya nagkaroon ng gap,"" De Guia said.
(It's easy to refer victims of other violations to other government agencies because there are programs for them. But the government does not have a program for survivors of extrajudicial killings, that's why there's a gap.)
Olalia, meanwhile, said that the families should be made aware that they are not alone in the fight for justice.
""Educate them and assure them that credible individuals and groups are willing to help them see this through without anything in return but to seek justice,"" he said.  ""[We need to] explain to them that what happened to them could happen to many others and that seeking justice for their kin is imperative to stop the madness and grief.""
Need for a law
Duterte is entering his 3rd year in office and the fight for accountability will still continue despite incidents seen as setbacks – including the Philippines' planned withdrawal from the International Criminal Court. (READ: The year of deaths and denials in the drug war)
Seeking accountability, according to Conde, is very important as it will empower the victims' families.
""If they see that the judicial system works, or that a police officer or suspect has been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted, they are more likely to come out and file complaints,"" he said.
""Duterte himself has said that he is going to pardon anybody who is convicted, so the victims ask: What is the point of pursuing cases if the perpetrators are already assured of being pardoned even if assuming that their case would even go past the inquest phase?"" Conde added.
Congress should also come up with a law that will further spell out and strengthen the punishment for those who commit extrajudicial killings, similar to the Anti-Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance Act and the Anti-Torture Act.
Until then, the CHR will have to make do with its current resources in a bid to ensure that the thousands of victims of what critics call ""the worst human rights crisis since Martial Law"" get justice – even if it may take a while. – Rappler.com

He added that there’s no proof that the slain suspects actually engage in drug trafficking. “Wala namang nagsabi sa atin niyan, maliban sa nakalagay na karatula sa kanila,” he said. (No one told us that, aside from the cardboards placed on top of them.)
At the same time, Pabillo showed concern for the family members of victims of extrajudicial killings.
""Kahit na totoo na sila ay drug pusher at nakagawa ng masama sa ibang tao, paano naman ang kanilang mga pamilya? Sila rin ngayon ay ginawan ng masama,"" he said.
(Even if it’s true that they’re drug pushers and they did something wrong to other people, what about their families? They themselves have been done wrong.)
The bishop asked, ""Maitutuwid ba natin ang masama sa pamamagitan ng masama?"" (Can we correct evil by doing evil?)
Duterte: Priests can't stop death
During his SONA on Monday, Duterte defended the killings of suspected drug pushers. 
Duterte earlier said he will protect policemen who kill suspected drug pushers in legitimate police operations. The long-time Davao City mayor, on the other hand, previously said there is ""no honor"" in extrajudicial kilings.
Duterte said in his SONA: ""Kayo namang hindi pa bungog diyan, hindi pa pumasok 'yang mga droga, e kung ayaw ninyong mamatay, ayaw ninyong masaktan, huwag kayong umasa diyan sa mga pari, pati human rights. Hindi nakakapigil 'yan ng kamatayan.""
(As for you who aren’t yet groggy, who haven’t gotten involved in drugs, if you don’t want to die, if you don’t want to get hurt, do not count on those priests, even those in human rights. They cannot stop death.)
The Mass on Monday – with the theme ""Huwag Kang Papatay"" (Thou Shall Not Kill) – is the first major movement of Catholics in response to Duterte's bloody war against illegal drugs. (READ: Mass held for 'sacrificial victims' in war vs drugs)
Estimates show at least 300 people have died in the war against drugs. This figure includes those killed in legitimate police operations and those in extrajudicial killings as well.
Leaders of Catholic nuns, the president of De La Salle Philippines, and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, among others, have voiced their concern over the killings since Duterte won the presidency.  
Former Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Viña on Monday said killing suspected drug traffickers will not win Duterte’s war against drugs. 
La Viña said in a pre-SONA analysis on Rappler: ""We all agree that the war on drugs won't be won by extrajudicial killings, or even death penalty, or even legitimate encounters. The war against drugs is also a war on poverty, war on powerlessness."" – with reports from Rambo Talabong and Janelle Paris/Rappler.com

Most of the victims were in their homes when armed men attacked them in the wee hours of the day.
The killings continued in the month of August, claiming at least 4 more lives. We have listed the killing incidents, who the victims were, where the killings took place, and the manner with which they were carried out.
The first casualties are the 4 police intelligence officers – Corporal Relebert Beronio, Patrolman Raffy Callao, Patrolman Ruel Cabellon, and Patrolman Marquino de Leon of the 704 Mobile Force Company of the Regional Mobile Force Battalion in Central Visayas – ambushed by the New People's Army (NPA) in Barangay Mabato in Ayungon town. The 4 victims, who were set up for the ambush, were supposed to meet their contact in the village, who turned out to have links with the rebels.
The chieftain of the village, Sunny Caldera, who was also tagged in the killings of the policemen, dies 5 days after the ambush. He allegedly drank pesticide. More than 20 suspects are tagged in the ambush-slay of the policemen, 8 of them already arrested and charged. 
 
Lawyer Anthony Trinidad from San Carlos City in Negros Occidental is killed in Guihulngan City. Aboard a sports utility vehicle with his wife and a client, they are waylaid by unknown assailants who shoot them at close range. The lawyer dies at the hospital, his wife sustains injuries, while the client is unscathed.
Rebel returnee Weny Alegre and Felimino Janayan, leader of a farmer's association, are gunned down by 4 unidentified men on two motorcycles in Zamboanguita town. The victims, also on board a motorcycle, were on their way home when they were attacked by the suspects and shot at close range.
In Dumaguete City, resident Yngwie Malmstien Fabugais who was watching television inside his home, is also shot several times by two unidentified men who enter his home. The police have yet to establish the motive for the killing. 
The bloodiest day, thus far, with 7 people killed in a span of 24 hours.
In Guihulngan City, Arthur Bayawa, a school principal and his sister, Ardale Bayawa, an official of the local Department of Education office, are shot dead inside their residence. Unidentified armed men barge into their home and kill them while they were asleep.
About 45 minutes later, Barangay Buenavista chief Romeo Alipan, is killed in Guihulngan, too, after his home is invaded by armed suspects. In Siaton town, Raklin Astorias of Barangay Maloh is shot to death by motorcycle-riding assailants. On board a motorcycle, the victim is attacked by the unidentified perpetrators.
In another shooting incident, Reden Eleuterio of Ayungon town is gunned down by unidentified men on a motorcycle. The victim dies on the spot. In Sta. Catalina town, a family is attacked by unidentified suspects, killing the father, Marlon Ocampo, and his one-year-old son Marjon. His wife and another child are wounded in the shooting.
Fedirico Sabejon of Siaton town is also killed in his home. The victim is shot dead by unidentified motorcycle-riding suspects. He is declared dead upon arrival at the hospital.
Armed men in the wee hours of the morning storm the home of Councilor Ramon Jalandoni in Barangay Panubigan in Canlaon City. They forcibly enter the house of the victim then shoot him with an unknown firearm. After a few minutes, Barangay Panubigan chief Ernesto Posadas in Canlaon is also killed after armed suspects attack his residence.
The suspects in the two Canlaon killings flee on a getaway vehicle. They also spray-paint the messages “Traidor sa NPA (Traitor to NPA)” and “Mabuhay ang NPA (Long live the NPA)” on the walls, fences, and vehicles of the victims. 
Over at Ayungon town, still on the same day, armed suspects barge into the home of former mayor Edsel Enardecido in Barangay Tampocon 1 and kill him and his cousin, Leo Enardecido. The former mayor is a cousin of the lawyer killed on July 23. 
Barangay Bucalan tanod Anaciancino Rosalita is shot dead at the Oval Public Market in Canlaon City, also in the same Panubigan village. While walking in the area, he is followed by an unidentified man who peppers him with bullets. He is the last victim for the month of July.
Joshua Partosa, a Grade 11 senior high school student, is gunned down by 4 assailants aboard two motorcycles in broad daylight in Sibulan town. Walking with his two siblings to school, the victim is shot by one of the suspects. He tries to escape but suspects catch up with him and shoot him again. He is also stabbed in the neck.
On the same day, a barangay kagawad and a former kagawad are gunned down in separate shooting incidents in neighboring Negros Occidental.
Former kagawad Fernando Toreno is shot dead by unidentified suspects on board a Ford Everest, in Barangay Kamaliskis in Salvador Benedicto. An hour later, 3 suspected assailants aboard a motorcycle are intercepted in neighboring San Carlos City. One of the suspects yields a caliber .45 pistol with magazine and ammunition.
After 4 hours, over at Moises Padilla town, Kagawad Raul Fat is shot to death by two unidentified men near the village hall in Barangay Macagahay. Two suspects approach the victim at the clinic then shoot him at close range. The two assailants, along with their 4 companions, who serve as lookout, flee the scene on foot.
 
Cristal Faith Jastiva of Bago City is shot to death by two assailants aboard a motorcycle while she is waiting for a pedicab at Magsaysay Avenue in Bacolod City, just a few meters from the Bacolod City Police Office headquarters. The victim had just come from the Metro Bacolod District Jail-Male Dormitory, which is adjacent to the city police office, to visit her partner. She is approached by the assailants who then shoot her at close range.
Meanwhile, Colonel Romeo Baleros, director of the Negros Occidental Police Provincial Office, has ordered his men to implement heightened security measures, particularly at the boundary of Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental.
At least 300 Special Action Force commandos were deployed to Negros Island to augment the local police units in their anti-criminality campaign. – Rappler.com"

MANILA, Philippines – Festive music blared from the speakers as 179 families attended a Christmas party at the Sacred Heart Village in Quezon City on Saturday, December 9.
Despite the celebratory music, however, there was sadness in the air as well.
It was, after all, not a typical Christmas party. The families present had lost a loved one to the Duterte administration's war on drugs.
The gathering had been organized by the Diocese of Novaliches to help the families heal and move forward as they fight for justice. (IN PHOTOS: Families of EJK victims celebrate early Christmas)
'No more celebration'
It served, at least for some, as a little escape from the pain and grief they have experienced from losing their loved ones.
Fe, for instance, lost her nephew Adrian in a police operation in Novaliches in August 2016. Adrian and his wife Vivian were reportedly killed while they were sleeping.
For Christmas this year, Fe promised to bring together the 7 children that the couple left behind. Fe shared that she and Vivian's parents had agreed to share the responsibility of raising the orphans – 3 are with Fe, while the 4 others are with their grandparents.
""Ang gusto lang talaga nila, magkasama-sama sila, kasi 'yun ang nakasanayan nila dati, sama-sama,"" Fe said, sobbing. ""Gagawa talaga ako ng paraan para makapag-celebrate sila ng sama-sama ngayong Pasko.""
(What they really want is to be together, just like what they're used to. I will really find a way to make sure they will celebrate Christmas together.)

For Cecilia, mother of 19-year-old Asoy, Christmas is no longer worth celebrating. Asoy, a graduate of a vocational automotive course, died last July in front of their house.
""Sabi ko sa mga anak ko, huwag na tayo mag-ano, mag-Pasko, nalulungkot lang ako dahil wala na ang anak kong isa,"" Cecilia said.
(I told my other children that we should no longer celebrate Christmas. I'm sad because one of my kids is gone.)
According to Cecilia, Asoy was a sweet, cheerful son. He even promised to buy a car so that he could help their family.
""Hindi na nga masaya sa bahay namin eh. Tapos kapag matutulog ka makikita mong kulang ang mga anak mo. Ang hirap lang talaga. Maski walang makain basta kumpleto 'yung mga anak ko,"" Cecilia shared while crying.
(Our home is no longer happy. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I see that my children are no longer complete. It's really difficult. I don't mind not having anything to eat as long as my children are complete.) 
Confronting challenges
While losing a loved one is tough, Bishop Antonio Tobias urged everyone to draw strength from their struggles.
""Ang nakaraan, mga nangyari, ay nakaraan na. Ibig sabihin, gusto ng Panginoon daanan mo 'yan. Daanan natin lahat ng ating mga pangkasalukuyan na mga pagsubok sapagkat diyan lamang lalakas ang inyong kalooban,"" he said.
(What is past is past. The Lord wants you to go through that. Let us persevere amid all the challenges because it is through them that we will find strength.)
During Tobias' homily, he also assured the victims' families that the Catholic Church is listening to the cries of the poor.
""Sa totoo hindi naman kayo nag-iisa. Nandito ang mga kapatid ninyo. Alam 'nyo itong ginagawa natin (church workers) ngayon, nakakapagbigay dapat ng lakas ng loob. 'Yan po ang diwa ng isang Kristiyano – 'di ka nagiisa,"" he added.
(You are not alone. All your brothers and sisters in faith are with you. This gathering should help strengthen your resolve. That is the essence of being a Christian – you are not alone.)
MOVE FORWARD. 'There is no easy way in moving on, only with the help of God,' Bishop Antonio Tobias tells the bereaved families.

Recently, the National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, known as the Baclaran Church, generated buzz on social media after temporarily replacing the INRI inscription on a crucifix with ""Stop the killings"" written on a piece of cardboard. (LOOK: Baclaran Church reminds faithful Jesus was an EJK victim too)
Last July, the Diocese of Caloocan joined the Walk for Life. They marched from San Ildefonso Parish to the Church of San Jose de Navotas to pray for victims, similar to the Walk for Life attended by around 10,000 people in Manila back in February.
Duterte has repeatedly slammed the Catholic Church, saying it should help address the country's drug problem instead of criticizing the anti-drug campaign. The Church, in fact, has been handling drug rehabilitation programs, such as one in Bulacan that has been running for more than two decades.
""Laban sa droga – kaya may namamatay diyan kasi laban 'yan eh, labanan. Pero para sa ating mga Kristiyano, ang buhay ay labanan pero dapat walang namamatay. Iyan ang ating ipakikita sa ngayon,"" Tobias said.

In the United States and its former colony, the Philippines, extrajudicial killings – long practiced but often swept aside – have recently become the norm.  
Is it possible to think comparatively, which is to say critically, about the connection between these two regimes of extra-judicial killings thousands of miles away: the police execution of black citizens and other peoples of color in the US on the one hand and the Presidentially-mandated, police and vigilante incited and performed executions of purported drug dealers and drug addicts in the Philippines on the other?
In the US, the targeting of black bodies has a very long history. It is rooted in centuries of racialized slavery, segregation and settler colonialism productive of and sustained by an ideology of white supremacy. The history of these practices and ideology continue to be deeply entrenched and institutionalized in militarized modes of policing which have emerged since the 1970s in response to urban insurgencies in US cities. Indeed, the history of policing in America has its roots in slave patrols – bands of armed white men employed by slave holders to keep blacks in check and search for runaways – as well as a long history of local codes designed to criminalize the mere presence of Native American and immigrants of color in urban areas. The system of discriminatory policing is also sustained by a vast prison-industrial complex. The criminal justice system in the US disproportionately incarcerates and disenfranchises people of color, placing them under constant surveillance even when they are released from prison. 
The climate for extrajudicial killings has been further stoked by the ready availability of assault rifles and other high-powered guns. Thanks to the lobbying efforts of Second-Amendment fundamentalists such as the NRA and the gun industry, the US now has a heavily armed citizenry. This volatile combination of racism and guns has literally triggered the recurring murder of black people by police forces and, more recently as in Dallas, the occasional armed response by a lone black gunman. 
Mostly poor
In the Philippine case, things are, of course, different. 
The targets of extrajudicial killings are mostly poor. Those who are influential and wealthy are publicly accused but held off from execution and subject to investigation, such as the police generals named by President Duterte. For the poor, however, there is no due process. Suspicion or accusation is warrant enough to kill them. Their bodies are displayed, at times with signs, for everyone to see as both warning to other dealers and as marks of the will of a sovereign power, as in any public execution. Terrorizing ordinary citizens, the display of their corpses are ways for the regime to claim for itself the power of their enemies and project this power to the people. 
What about the comparative responses to extrajudicial killings? 
In the US, anti-racist movements such as Black Lives Matter arise to protest the killings. They draw on a long history of civil rights activism that appeal to liberal democracy even as they are critical of its discriminatory application. Media debates are intense, and the conservative press aside, there is a real debate to recast issues and put forth solutions both on the local and national level. And the US being an imperial power, it is not uncommon that racist violence at home are often linked to racist warfare abroad, and more generally the racializing inequities of global capitalism. Hence, many have pointed out the irony of President Obama denouncing both the police murders of blacks even as he presides over a kill-list of suspected terrorists in the Middle East targeted for drone assassination. The use of a robot to kill the alleged assassin of Dallas cops during a Black Lives Matter demonstration shows how the counter-terrorist weaponry used abroad has come home to roost in the US cities. 
HUMAN RIGHTS. The Philippines is one of the worst places for human rights defenders, 32 of whom were killed in 2015.

In the Philippines, social movements have yet to emerge questioning extrajudicial killings.
While some Senators and human rights advocates raise objections, no one wants to be seen as coddling or protecting those who are killed. The communist Left and its allies have so far remained circumspect over these killings in an attempt to solidify their coalition with Duterte. Some of the armed groups have even acted as vigilantes to carry out killings in the provinces. Everyone, or at least most everyone, thus assumes that those who are killed are guilty and their innocence need not be proved. They are dead because they deserve to be dead according to this solipsistic populism. They have forfeited their rights, and due process would simply be a waste of time and resources, according to this logic, since courts are corrupt and drug dealers, armed with lots of cash, will simply bribe their way out of prosecution. 
Unlike the US, victims of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines start out as being racially or ethnically identical with their perpetrators. But being associated with illegal drugs renders them into a different race altogether: one deserving neither human recognition nor humane treatment. They become in the eyes of the President, the police and vigilantes, pieces of garbage polluting society and so needing to be cleared away. Their corpses then become surfaces which serve as living signs of an ominous power capable of overcoming the power of death itself.
In both the US and Philippines cases, there is thus a process of racialization that takes place. In the US, it entails the ""blackening"" or “browning” of bodies tantamount to their criminalization and the necessary prelude for the police to render summary judgment as to who shall live and who shall die. But the response to police violence and white supremacy is loud and swift: wide-spread opposition develops, calls are made for reform and the prosecution of guilty police, academic analysis and policy debates ensue. Even if it seems like little changes, the political and ethical stakes of opposing racialized extra-judicial killings are clear. The ready availability of cell phones to record killings have further given citizens an important tool for raising awareness and providing proof of these police murders.  
In the Philippines, again, nothing of this sort has or is likely to happen.
Poor people, to begin with, have few rights that the middle class or the wealthy are compelled to recognize. From the perspective of the latter, the poverty of the former is not related to the wealth of those above; the causes of their destitution are rarely traced to the privilege of the rich; and their tendency to turn to crime, including the dealing and consumption of illegal drugs, are disconnected from any understanding of their immiseration and the precariousness of their daily lives. Historically excluded from the liberal elite democracy inherited from nationalist ilustrados, the poor exist to be exploited, their votes bought, their labor used up, their sufferings patronized and made into the material for soap operas and political sloganeering. Small wonder then that they can be easily racialized: set aside as less than human and casually killed, their deaths weighing less than a centavo on the heads of those above. By subsuming the poor as a separate race, the class-based violence of the state is also tinged with racist intent. 
But what about the poor themselves? What is their understanding of extrajudicial killings?
I'm not sure and I’m not aware of much research on this topic—an absence which is itself telling of the seriousness, or lack of it, with which their views are taken by the political and cultural intelligentsia. But we can guess at some of the reasons why they stand by while the killings occur. Perhaps some support the President and the police, seeing drug dealers as non-humans with little or no rights. Perhaps they have been victimized by dealers themselves, suffering their extortions and violence. Indeed, some of those targeted have been corrupt cops known for taking bribes and selling drugs. One can imagine how their execution might seem like just deserts to those who knew them. 
No doubt, the poor are also fearful of intervening directly. Bereft of resources, they feel their disenfranchisement and vulnerability on the most practical level. Rather than confront state authorities, many opt for a variety of traditional tactics to negotiate with them—from bribes to compliance, from collaboration to flight, though very rarely do the poor resort to assassination and other violent—and riskier--forms of retaliation against the police. In short, they will do anything to deflect the full force of those above while inflecting that force towards maximizing their chances for survival. 
In any case, the seeming passivity, maybe even consent, of the poor to extrajudicial killings remains a real puzzle. The relative absence of collective class-based response occurs amid the sharp and finely developed sense of class-consciousness whereby the poor have a deep understanding of what it means to be poor.
This gap between action and consciousness is undoubtedly common in many places and among other classes. But in the context of extrajudicial killings aimed specifically at the poor, it stands in stark contrast to the strength of anti-racist discourse and resistance in the US. Such a contrast deserves further study. –Rappler.com

The Mr and Ms PUP Engineering pageant had sparked outrage online after candidates posed for a photo shoot that had extrajudicial killings as the theme. The pictures were uploaded via Facebook album, and have since been deleted.
The organizers have said sorry to those who were offended, and explained that they only wanted to raise awareness of the spate of killings in the country.
In a statement sent to media on Thursday, PUP College of Engineering dean Guillermo Bernabe also apologized on behalf of the college.
""We offer our apologies to the families of the victims of extrajudicial killings. The Mr and Ms College Engineering pageant has been already canceled until further notice,"" Bernabe said.
He added that while the students ""had the best intentions in their #EmbraceYourFlaws photo shoot,"" they were unable to deliver their message well.
The candidates who posed as victims of extrajudicial killings had cardboard signs next to them, showing their ""flaws"" or ""insecurities."" Real victims often have cardboard signs as well, claiming they are drug pushers or drug users.
""As a university that hones its students to be socially aware and critical, we believe that matters like extrajudicial killings shall not be downplayed to just a theme in a pageant's shoot,"" Bernabe said.
""This experience has helped the College of Engineering be more responsible and keen-sighted on the topics that we will highlight in our future events.""
Since President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs began on July 1, 2016, there have been 7,080 deaths recorded. Of this figure, 2,555 were killed in police operations, while the rest were victims of vigilante-style or unexplained killings.
The spate of killings in the country has been condemned both here and abroad, including by the United Nations, the European Parliament, the United States, and the International Commission of Jurists. (READ: Cops are paid to kill in PH war on drugs – Amnesty Int'l) – Rappler.com"

Some families marked the annual Filipino event a couple of days earlier, and in a different way.  On Monday afternoon, October 30, families of victims of drug-related deaths gathered at the Most Holy Trinity Parish in Sampaloc, Manila, to share their stories and dedicate prayers for their slain loved ones. 
The ""Padasal Para sa mga Pinaslang: Undas ng Kababaihan (Prayer vigil for the slain: All Saints' Day of Women),"" organized by women's group Baigani, aims to support families who experienced similar traumatic events.
Artists read poems and sang songs influenced by the culture of impunity that those in the room experienced. 
Lea (not her real name), a resident of Camarin, Caloocan, said the group has become her new family after she lost her husband, who was summarily executed last year.
The first few months after his death were the hardest, Lea said, as neighbors judged and ignored her. ""I almost went insane, that I even thought of ending my life, as well as my children's, to end our misery,"" she said.
She now draws strength from her fellow widows. “For the first time, I am able to speak without others judging me. I am with people who understand me.” 
Women warriors
CANDLES FOR THE DEAD. Candles are lit around an outline of a body of a man.

This kind of isolation from their own communities is one reason Baigani was created as a group for ""women warriors,"" according to activist nun Sister Mary John Mananzan.
The traumatic experience of the families of EJK victims is “comparable to none,” Mananzan said. “The only people who could comprehend your pain are the same people who experienced it.” 
With Baigani’s partnership with parishes and other support groups, the widows and mothers are provided with free therapy sessions and legal assistance. 
Katherine Bacani, whose husband was killed in a police operation in August 5, 2017, said a lot of her fellow widows were in tears when she shared her husband's story, as if they were reliving their own experiences.
The women in the group eventually became her friends. “Now we can joke around and talk about things other than our trauma,” Katherine said. 
Justice for all

As night fell, all of the women were given candles to be placed in front of the altar as the names of the victims were recited. Volunteers and supporters also lit candles and prayed for victims. 
Behind the lit candles was a glass box filled with yellow chicks feeding on grains, traditionally placed on top of the coffin of a crime victim. It is said that the pecking of the chick would nudge the perpetrators' conscience. 
Activist and actress Mae Paner, popularly known as “Juana Change,” joined the lighting of candles after performing a monologue about a widow and Zumba instructor – inspired by a woman’s real life experience. 
Katherine lit hers for her husband, Adolfo, and the husbands and sons of her newfound friends. 
Although justice is still elusive, Katherine feels that they have attained a bit of it from the outpouring of love they have received from strangers. 
“While there is no justice for our loved ones yet, there is justice in the constant support we receive, because we draw from it our strength to fight,” she said. – Rappler.com"

""The deaths of these victims and the agonies of the families they left behind – their widows and orphans – remind us of a fundamental belief that like you, I too am my brother's keeper; I too am my sister's keeper,"" she said. (READ: 'Nanlaban sila': Duterte's war on drugs)
End killings
In the same message, De Lima reiterated her call to end the killings amid the Duterte administration's intensifed war on illegal drugs.
""So on this day and all the days henceforth, let us do our part to end these killings and allow the mighty stream of the rule of law and justice flow. The fight will not be easy because we are up against the idea that it is fine to kill in the name of war against drugs,"" De Lima said.
The senator said the upcoming visit of UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard is the nation's chance to stand its ground for justice and truth ""until extrajudicial killings are finally put to rest."" (READ: UN expert gets Duterte invite to probe killings)
The senator made the statement as the Philippine National Police aims to nab over 300,000 drug targets by the end of the year.  The PNP has listed as its ""target and end result"" over 334,137 individuals from drug watchlists until December 2016. (READ: Caught in the middle of the drug war)
De Lima and Duterte have long been at odds over the issue of human rights. As former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, De Lima investigated Duterte's alleged links to the Davao Death Squad (DDS). The probe went on when she became justice secretary.
She drew the ire of Duterte anew after she launched a Senate investigation into the spate of extrajudicial killings under his administration.
De Lima was ousted as chairperson of the Senate justice committee after she presented witness Edgar Matobato, a self-confessed hitman of the DDS, who accused Duterte of ordering killings when he was city mayor.
The panel, in its initial findings, said neither Duterte nor the state sponsored the killings and that there is no evidence that the death squad exists. – Rappler.com

The shooting of Piñar, a 63-year-old farmer, was reported by several local and international media, the incident being the first case where police killed a civilian a day after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered state security forces to shoot dead any quarantine violators who would endanger their lives. (READ: 'Shoot them dead': Duterte orders troops to kill quarantine violators)
News reports said that a village health worker cautioned Piñar for not wearing a mask at a police checkpoint. A supposedly drunk Piñar got angry and attacked the health workers and the police with a scythe.
A police officer who tried but failed to pacify Piñar ended up shooting him dead, the South China Morning Post reported.
Netizens slammed Duterte for giving the shoot-to-kill order and his government’s overall approach to curb the spread of the coronavirus that has left several poor families hungry and unable to cope with the economic impact of the community quarantine measures.
Duterte has a proclivity for giving such orders. In his administration’s war against illegal drugs, he has repeatedly encouraged police to shoot dead drug suspects who would resist arrest.
Human rights lawyer Chel Diokno has taken up the cudgels for families of the victims of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration.
Diokno said in an episode of Rappler Talk aired on Saturday, April 4, that the “use of deadly force is really meant to be as a last resort.” (WATCH: Rappler Talk: Chel Diokno on the Rule of Law in a pandemic)
“Someone who would be arrested could be subdued without having to use a firearm,” Diokno said.
Duterte has placed only the entire Luzon in lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, but several local governments in the Visayas and Mindanao have enforced their own ""enhanced communityb quarantine"" that limits movement of people. (READ ALSO: [OPINION] Can we beat the coronavirus with ‘discipline’?) 
Even then, as the lockdown enters its final week, the number of coronavirus cases in the country hovered over the 4,000 mark. On Monday, April 6, the Department of Health (DOH) said that 163 have died while 73 patients have recovered. (READ: PH coronavirus cases jump to 3,660, death toll hits 163)

June 30, 2020 signals not just President Rodrigo Duterte’s 4th year in power, but also another year without justice for the thousands killed in his anti-illegal drugs campaign.
It will be exactly 1,003 days since Nanette Castillo’s son, Aldrin, was mercilessly killed in Tondo, Manila. Since October 2, 2017, Nanette has desperately tried to fill in the void left when unidentified gunmen asked Aldrin to kneel before shooting him twice in the head and twice in the torso.
More than two years may have passed but the details remain vivid as ever for Nanette. She remembers her daughter’s frantic voice on the other line, the one-hour commute to the scene of the crime, and seeing her son’s lifeless and bloodied body slumped on the road.  
The pain and grief will never go away, Nanette said, but they are fueling her quest for justice. She has since joined protest movements, engaged with other grieving mothers and widows, and has openly talked in public against the violent drug war.
“Nagpahayag na agad ako ng matinding galit at paghingi ng hustisya,” she said. “Ang motivation ko, hindi katanggap-tanggap na ginawa nila sa anak ko.” 
(I voiced out my anger and call for justice almost immediately. I am motivated by the unacceptable deed they did to my son.) 
JUSTICE. Nanette Castillo remembers her son Aldrin.

Nanette told Rappler that fear will always be there. Her family fears for her life. Distant relatives, all supporters of the administration, already told her to stop because it will not lead to anything. Even other families of victims, whom she’d talked to, are afraid.  
“Mahal na mahal ko ang anak ko at hindi ako papayag na ganyan na nga nangyari sa kanya tapos makakalimutan pa ng mga tao, na walang hustisya para sa kamatayan niya,” she said. “Palagi siyang nasa puso at isip ko kaya alam ko na gusto niyang ilaban ko siya.” 
(I love my son so much and given what has happened, I will not allow him to be forgotten by people and to have no justice for his death. He’s always in my heart and mind, I know that he wants me to fight for him.) 
On the legal side, there has been not much progress for Aldrin’s case. His death remains to be one of the thousands that are yet to be solved, if the investigation was even started in the first place. 
According to Nanette, the only document she has is the spot report.
“Nilakad ko iyong police report, hindi sila willing ibigay kahit ano,” she said. “Marami silang dahilan, sinasabihan ako pumunta na lang sa madaling-araw kasi ganyang oras naka-duty ang investigator ko, sinong magiging panatag ang loob na pumunta doon nang ganoong oras?”  
(I tried to get the police report, they weren’t willing to give anything. They gave many reasons and they told me to just go past midnight because that’s when the investigator is on duty. Who will be comfortable going to a police station at that time?) 
Nanette’s experience with police officers is similar to thousands of others. Uncooperative police officers are usually the first hurdle that families face in trying to get justice for their loved ones.  
Even the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), mandated by the 1987 Philippine Constitution to investigate state abuses, faces a blank wall when it comes to dealing with the PNP. 
The promised opening of police reports, or even at least spot reports, never materialized despite numerous letters of request.
“Lackluster ang cooperation nila sa amin (Their cooperation with us is lackluster),” CHR Investigation Office Director Jasmin Regino told Rappler. “They have a number of ways to decline our requests.” 
The lack of information-sharing and access to important documents proved to be a challenge. It’s like “looking for a needle in a haystack,” Regino said, since they start with nothing. They get a tip, but they will not be able to probe further.  
CHR’s special investigators sometimes have to employ their own techniques in probing. In some cases, they resort to just taking photos of documents they need after negotiating with the police. 
STOP ABUSES. The Commission on Human Rights faces challenges in doing its mandate against state abuses.

The Commission also partners with several civil society organizations, faith-based groups, and even barangay human rights action officers for documentation purposes. 
“Kung ayaw man kami bigyan ng copies ng reports ng kapulisan, at least may makukuha kaming information from our partners on the ground,” Regino said. ""More or less, meron na kaming panghahawakan so we can deploy our special investigators.”
(If the police don’t give us reports, at least we can get information from partners on the ground. More or less, we have some information so we can deploy our special investigators.) 
Non-cooperation of law enforcers, together with the Commission’s lack of manpower resources, proved to be a challenge in pursuing justice for the victims of Duterte’s war on drugs.  
The violent campaign has claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in police operations, while human rights groups estimate the number to reach at least 27,000, to include vigilante killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
But CHR has investigated only 3,101 cases – 1,803 were killed in police operations while 1,298 were killed vigilante-style.
The Commission has so far referred 96 cases to other government bodies while 7 are set to be filed soon: 
CHR also has archived at least 500 cases already due to lack of evidence or other vital information that could move it forward. 
But Regino said that archiving a case is not the end, it just means that it will be parked until more evidence come in, or a witness comes forward.  
“Even victims' families, they refuse to cooperate with us because of the climate of fear kasi raw baka raw babalikan sila (since they fear reprisal),” she said. “Kahit kami tumutulong na, marami talaga ang takot at ayaw talaga magsalita (Even if we're helping them already, a lot are still scared and don’t want to speak).”
Regino recalled families who reported being harassed by local authorities, or felt that they were being monitored when they reached out to CHR. This usually leads to them refusing to further cooperate with investigators, or withdraw the case altogether.  
Still, despite the small number of families going forward, Regino said CHR continues to monitor and document everything that’s happening. The prescription period for murder or homicide, after all, is 20 years, according to the Revised Penal Code. 
“May mga pamilya kasi na because of the political landscape, ayaw nila mag-file for now,” she said. “Kapag nag-iba na lang daw ang presidente because of the climate of fear, it really boils down to the climate of fear and reprisal.”  
(There are families who say they don't want to really file anything for now because of the political landscape. Maybe when there’s a different president already because of the climate of fear. It really boils down to the climate of fear.) 
The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a report released on June 4, said that there is a “failure of domestic mechanisms to ensure accountability thus far.” (DOCUMENT: U.N. Human Rights report on killings, abuses in PH)
An analysis by Rappler also found that the Duterte administration has allowed thousands of killings to go unsolved, mainly due to systematic gaps at the police and prosecutorial levels. 
Lawyer Krissy Conti knows all too well how the climate of fear and impunity blocked justice for many victims. It has manifested in the judicial process, too.
“Natatakot ka kasi puwede ka balikan, natatakot ka kasi hindi mapaparusahan iyong gumawa ng masama sa kapamilya mo, natatakot ka kasi iyong ‘justice’ na makukuha mo would be incomplete at hindi naman talaga makukulong,” she told Rappler. 
(You’re afraid that they will get back at you, you’re afraid that the ones who wronged your next of kin will not be punished, you’re afraid that the justice they will give is incomplete and won’t even jail the perpetrators.)
“If you're going against government policy, then it’s so sure that every stage of the prosecutor or the legal aspect, meron kang kalaban (you will have to face an enemy),” Conti added.
She said there is “a little bit of a glimmer of hope” in local courts. But it takes a long time. 
For example, Conti pointed out a case she’s handling that’s taken close to 3 years already, in the same Caloocan court that convicted the killers of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos – the first conviction of abusive cops in Duterte’s drug war.
“Ang napansin namin (we’ve noticed), if you put public pressure and the public eye on cases, judges will be more critical,” she said.

As member of the NUPL, Conti has been at the forefront helping families of drug war victims explore the avenues where they can seek justice. (READ: Lawyers do dirty groundwork to fight Duterte’s drug war)  
She understands the fear of families, of lawyers, of those involved in the legal process. But she highlights also the courage of mothers, of widows, who come together to seek justice for their slain loved ones.  
Since December 2016, Conti has been assisting the Rise Up for Life and Rights, a group composed of families left behind. She recalled that mothers and widows help each other determine what cases are ripe for filing or what still needs some further documentation. 
“Every time a mother files a case, she is backed up by other mothers and other families,” she said. “It’s never going to be about one victim, one family, it’s going to be about the community.” 
Rise Up for Life and Rights brought its quest for justice to the International Criminal Court (ICC), after Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced that her office is opening a preliminary investigation into the drug war killings. 
In August 2018, the group submitted to Bensouda a 50-page complaint in which they ""call for an end to madness and for President Duterte, who has likened himself to one of the most evil men in history, to be brought before the ICC and be held to account for crimes against humanity.""
The families' quest for justice has now gone beyond their sons and husbands. They did not want what happened to their loved ones happen to others.  
The international court’s move has struck a chord. Duterte withdrew the Philippines’ membership from the ICC, aside from publicly lambasting Bensouda.  (READ: Duterte throws out decade-long fight for the International Criminal Court) 
But the withdrawal will have no effect on ongoing proceedings at the ICC. According to Bensouda, her office aims to finalize the preliminary examination in 2020 so they “reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the situation in the Philippines.”
There is still no hint of what will happen. But for Conti, what sets the possible case with the ICC from international condemnation is that there’s a “real threat of arrest for Duterte.” 
“Even if we say that the ICC has actually carried out only a few arrests, there is still a possibility that it could happen to Duterte,” she said. “Liliit ang mundo niya, even that slight chance na makulong siya, I think that jars him.” 
(His world will become smaller. Even that slight chance of going to jail, I think that jars him.) 
REMEMBERING. Nanette Castillo maintains a corner dedicated to her slain son Aldrin.

On Wednesday, June 24, Nanette Castillo commemorated the 997th day since Aldrin was killed. She rearranged the existing small corner dedicated to her son. Strips of LED lights surround the frames, illuminating photos of Aldrin whose smile is now a distant memory. 
Posting this development on Facebook, Nanette wrote: ""Nais kong palaging may ilaw ang mga larawan nya mapa araw man o gabi! Lalaging may puwang si Aldrin sa bahay at sa puso namin at iyon ang hindi nila kayang kunin sa akin."" (I want his photos to be illuminated day and night. Aldrin will always have a place in our home and hearts, and that's something they can never take away from me.)
In about 4 months, Nanette will mark Aldrin’s 3rd year death anniversary. Her son’s killers remain unidentified but she hasn't lost hope.
There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the case of her son. One thing Nanette is sure of: in one way or another, justice will catch up with Duterte and other government officials complicit in the drug war.
“Hindi ko siya kaya ipasa-Diyos, although nagdadasal ako palagi na sana mabigyan siya ng hustisya, hindi ko kaya ipabahala na lang kay Lord,” she said. “Kailangan ko talaga kumilos.”

Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales announced this on Tuesday, August 29, after a Senate budget hearing on her office's proposed 2018 budget. (READ: Can Ombudsman take over Kian case?)
""We already started our fact-finding investigation. The Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (MOLEO) of Ramos is here. He has already started the fact-finding investigation,"" Morales told reporters in an interview, referring to Deputy Ombudsman Cyril Ramos who heads the MOLEO.
Morales also said they have already started sending out subpoenas for documents and witnesses.
Police shot Delos Santos for allegedly fighting back during an anti-drug operation. CCTV footage and witnesses' testimonies, however, indicate that the boy was a victim of an extrajudicial killing.
Ballistic tests show the bullet found inside Delos Santos' body came from the gun of PO3 Arnel Oares, who led the raid. Delos Santos, meanwhile, tested negative for gunpowder.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said he talked to Morales, who supposedly confirmed that her office has indeed ""concurrent jurisdiction"" over Delos Santos' case, as it involves government officers with a salary grade below SG27.
""The Ombudsman has confirmed that she has concurrent jurisdiction with the DOJ (Department of Justice) insofar as Kian's killing is concerned. But, because of the MOA (memorandum of agreement), it's the DOJ that's assuming jurisdiction. She is, in fact, conducting a fact-finding investigation on the same case, on a number of issues,"" Drilon said.
In the Senate probe into the teenager's death, Drilon slammed Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II for his ""bias"" and asked Aguirre if he would be willing to have the case transferred to the Ombudsman.
Aguirre, however, rejected the proposal because it might make the DOJ look ""incompetent"" and incapable of conducting an impartial probe. (READ: Aguirre: What's the difference between kids killed by addicts, cops?)
""If [the] Ombudsman can conduct [a] preliminary investigation on impeachable officials, how much more ordinary policemen? So that only indicates the erroneous interpretation of the secretary (Aguirre) in the desire to just assume jurisdiction over the investigation,"" Drilon said. 
On Tuesday, a formal petition was filed before the DOJ seeking its inhibition from conducting a preliminary investigation into the murder and torture complaints against Caloocan City cops.
""The Office of the Ombudsman is the best forum to conduct the preliminary investigation for this case given the impartiality of this constitutionally-mandated body,"" said the petition. – Rappler.com

Duterte's statements on killing drug users,,"MANILA, Philippines – It has been a common refrain between the government and its critics: the latter decries President Rodrigo Duterte's ""shoot-to-kill"" orders against alleged drug users, while the former denies there ever was such a thing. 
As human rights groups, international media, and diplomats begin to take increasing notice of the number of drug-related deaths in the Philippines, it comes with criticism against what they perceive as the government's tacit endorsement of extrajudicial killings.
The harrowing images have been splashed across international news outlets: photos of slain people with their faces wrapped in tape, usually beside a cardboard sign saying: ""I'm a drug pusher, do not emulate me.""
But the relatives of some of the victims insist that their loved ones did not fit the profile of a drug user, or were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
One US senator said Duterte was endorsing ""what amounts to mass murder."" Human rights groups point out that vigilantes have grown emboldened because of Duterte's many statements defending and even promoting the killing of alleged drug users who fight back.
Even before the start of the campaign period for the May 2016 polls, Duterte had already promised to order the killing of criminals. But he emphasized that this should only be done if they fight back.
This caveat has been the government's consistent defense against criticism that it endorses extrajudicial killings.
Shoot to kill, DIY arrests
Duterte has long been vocal about his hardliner stance against illegal drugs. His campaign threats to kill drug users, he said, were not rhetorical.
Several months since the May polls, the Philippines is seeing the concrete evidence of that statement: thousands have been killed in Duterte's bloody war on drugs, some of them under questionable circumstances. (READ: 'Nanlaban sila': Duterte's war on drugs)
In May, shortly after winning the elections, Duterte said he would give security forces ""shoot to kill"" orders against those who resist arrest. 
He also said he would offer million-peso bounties for the capture or death of drug lords.  
But he was quick to add: ""I'm not saying you kill them but the order is 'dead or alive.'""
The President has made several pronouncements in the same vein, issuing shoot-to-kill orders but immediately clarifying that it should only be done if the suspects resist arrest.
He has made this call not only to law enforcers, but to ordinary citizens. In June, during a thanksgiving party in Davao City, Duterte endorsed the idea of ordinary civilians engaging in do-it-yourself arrests.
""Kayong nandiyan sa neighborhood ninyo (Those among you in your respective neighborhoods), feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourself if you have the gun, you have my support,"" he said.
If a suspect resists arrest, ""you can kill him,"" Duterte said.
The President added, ""Only if your life is in danger, at lumaban, at may baril din at kutsilyo, barilin mo (and there is resistance and the suspect is armed with a gun or knife, shoot). I'll give you a medal."" 
'Layered' messages?
Aside from issuing shoot-to-kill orders, Duterte has vowed to protect the policemen who do their duty, even if they kill a thousand people in the course of their work.
""Do not bullshit with me but do your duty, I will die for you. Do your duty and if in the process you kill 1,000 persons because you were doing your duty, I will protect you,"" he said in July. 
That message was said even during the campaign period, when Duterte said he would pardon policemen convicted of killing criminals and civilians while performing their duties. 
In August, the President acknowledged that some of those killed in the war on drugs were victims of extrajudicial killings. 
He then echoed the police's defense, insisting that those killed in police operations all fought back. 
In September, however, Duterte's message took on a different tone. In contrast to his earlier pronouncement that only those who resist arrest should be killed, this time, Duterte told soldiers that criminals should be killed whether or not they fight back. 
""Pagka bumunot, patayin mo. 'Pag hindi bumunot, patayin mo rin, putang ina, para matapos na. Eh kaysa mawala pa 'yung baril. Ako na ang bahala sa inyo,"" he said. 
(If they pull out a gun, kill them. If they don't, kill them still, son of a whore, so it's over, lest you lose the gun. I'll take care of you.)
But it's unclear whether the President meant it, because he would later flip-flop on his own statement by saying he would never order the military to commit illegal acts.
""Hindi ako mag-order ng illegal. 'Wag kayong maniwala diyan. (I won't order anything illegal. Don't believe that.) I did not order you and the police to perform punitive police action. I have declared war against the drug syndicates in this country. You know what is war. War is war,"" he said.
Asked about the President's conflicting messages, Abella said Duterte's remarks are ""layered.""
But this shoot-to-kill order has been slammed by critics, including Senator Leila de Lima. De Lima, a former justice secretary and former chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, said that such an order should only be a last resort of law enforcers.
Senator Panfilo Lacson also agreed with De Lima, saying that shoot-on-sight or shoot-to-kill orders not used for self-defense would be murder. 
Killings 'not a gov't policy'
In the face of mounting criticism over the death toll in the war on drugs, Malacañang has defended itself by saying that extrajudicial killings are not a policy of the Duterte government. 
""Notwithstanding the accusations hurled against him, no formal charge of human rights violations has been filed. Alleged EJKs (extrajudicial killings) are not the policy of his administration,"" Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said last month.
Abella also told the United Nations that Duterte, as a lawyer and former prosecutor, ""knows the limits of the power and authority of the presidency."" 
Various groups, such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), pointed out however that Duterte's statements constitute an ""implicit"" support of killings in violation of the rule of law.
""Duterte implicitly voiced support for such unlawful brutality by stating that police can rightly put illegal drug suspects 'below the ground' if necessary,"" HRW's Phelim Kine said.
He added, ""President Duterte must publicly recognize that respect for rule of law and fulfilling the human rights of Filipinos extends to all Filipinos, including criminal suspects and those implicated in the drug trade.""
Should the President's statements be interpreted as a tacit approval of drug-related killings? In his public statements, Duterte is careful to add that killing should be done only if necessary. But with 2,294 victims of extrajudicial killings as of latest figures – and with investigations into these deaths still pending – these drug-related killings remain a cause for concern for the Philippine government. – Rappler.com"

""Tama na po 'yang declaration sa media. Kung talagang may banta, gamitin ang mga remedyo at mayroon tayong writ of amparo,"" Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said in Palace news briefing.
(Stop making declarations to media. If there is really a threat, use the available remedies like the writ of amparo.)
Picardal, who has lived in seclusion since April and has not approached the media, wrote in a blog post how 6 men on board 3 motorcycles and wearing ""full-faced helmets"" stationed themselves outside a Cebu monastery he visits as part of his routine.
Picardal said that if he had visited the monastery that day, August 11, he could have become ""a victim of extrajudicial killing and the 4th priest to be killed under the Duterte regime had I stuck to my routine.""
Roque, a lawyer, assured Picardal that if he files a writ of amparo, the courts will quickly act on it.
""His remedy is to file a writ of amparo with the Supreme Court. It can be filed in the lower courts and it will be acted upon expeditiously,"" said the presidential spokesman.
The writ of amparo is a legal remedy in which a person or group of persons may obtain a temporary restraining order if their right to life, security, and liberty is threatened or violated by a public official or private entity.
It can be filed, for free, before the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan, or Regional Trial Courts.
The writ is meant to protect persons from abuses by the military and police, and from extrajudicial killings. 
Picardal is no stranger to the issue of extrajudicial killings. As a member of the Coalition Against Summary Executions (Case), Picardal documented killings allegedly carried out by the Davao Death Squad (DDS) when President Rodrigo Duterte was Davao City mayor. Picardal was based in Davao City from 1977 to 1981 and from 1995 to 2011.
The DDS is allegedly responsible for the deaths of at least 1,000 people. Whistleblowers have accused Duterte himself of masterminding or leading the death squad. 
Picardal began his life as a hermit in the mountains in April, after going on a two-week ""Bike for Life and Peace"" around Northern Mindanao where he advocated 3 appeals: end extrajudicial killings, resume peace talks with communist rebels, and lift martial law in Mindanao.  (READ: One last bike trip for the fearless Father Picx) – Rappler.com

They follow the lead of Efren Morillo, friend of their slain relatives who survived the “execution-style killing” and who earlier filed his complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman.
The families filed supplemental affidavits on Thursday, March 16, to bolster Morillo's complaint.
According to lawyer Rommel Bagares, they have monitored around 100 similar cases being handled by other lawyers.
Could this lead to cases that will directly link President Rodrigo Duterte and the Philippine National Police to the murders?
“It requires a deeper investigation,"" Bagares said.""Of course there is the memorandum circular of the police, so we are looking into the elements of the PNP’s memorandum circular ordering TokHang.""
Bagares stressed the importance of paper trail but lamented the police’s lack of cooperation when it comes to providing documents.
Women take the fight
The supplemental complaint filed on Thursday back up Morillo’s accusations of multiple murder, frustrated murder, robbery, planting of firearms, planting of evidence and grave misconduct against police official Senior Inspector Emil Garcia, and policemen PO3 Allan Formilleza, PO1 James Aggarao and PO1 Melchor Navisaga.
They conducted the Oplan TokHang operations and allegedly gunned down the victims while they sat on a bench handcuffed and begging for their lives.
The complainants are Marilyn Malimban, live-in partner of Jessie Cule; Lydia Gabo, mother of Rhaffy Gabo; and Maria Belen Daa, mother of Marcelo Daa Jr. 
Too scared
Apart from Cule, Daa and Gabo, Anthony Comendo also died in the operation but his family is too scared to file a case.
“Apat and biktima dito, may isa pang pamilya ayaw sumama kasi natatakot sila... may pananakot pa rin na nangyayari,” Bagares said.
(There were 4 victims, there’s another relative who should have filed but they didn’t because they were scared. In fact, we think they’re still being subjected to threats and intimidation.)
Bagares added: “Napagalaman ko sa mga kasamahan kong abugado na may dalawang bangkay na tinapon malapit sa bahay ng nanay ni Marcelo Daa, parang threat siya sa mga kliyente namin.”
(We found out that two dead bodies were thrown near the house of Marcelo Daa’s mother as a way of threatening our clients.)
This, even if they had secured a permanent protection order from the Court of Appeals (CA) last February.
Bagares and his colleagues from the Center for International Law (CenterLaw) first sought a writ of amparo from Supreme Court (SC) and later the (CA) precisely because the complainants claimed they were being harrassed by the said policemen.
In granting the writ, the SC and the CA prohibited the cops from going within a 1-kilometer radius from the complainants.
The courts also directed the reassignment of the policemen and ordered the PNP to update the complainants of their investigation into the incident.
'Execution-style killing'
The policemen conducted TokHang operations on August 21, 2016 – a police practice of knocking on doors of suspected drug dealers and pushers to convince them to surrender. Critics said the campaign is a mere cover for executions.
The cops barged into a shanty in Payatas where the five men were playing pool. A 14-year-old witness said the cops took the men to the back of the house and shot them one by one.
“Jessie Cule was the last of the 3 to be killed. He begged to be spared, hugging the legs of one of the armed men and sobbing. As he would not let go of his hold, the man shot him on the nape,"" their petition to the SC reads.
Morillo survived by playing dead and then later sliding down into a ravine and walked until he reached the highway. Morillo is now under the custody of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)
On Tuesday, another murder complaint was filed against Police Superintendent Ali Jose Duterte for the deaths of a drug suspect and his son in a buy-bust operation in Caloocan in September 2016. – Rappler.com

Bongbong, the only son and namesake of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, sat on a plush chair facing Enrile, former Marcos defense minister and known architect and implementor of Martial Law. (READ: Martial Law, the dark chapter in Philippine history) 
But the two men made false or misleading claims in their video entitled, ""JPE: A Witness to History,"" a clear attempt to justify Marcos’ Proclamation No. 1081 which placed the whole country under martial rule on September 21, 1972.
Bongbong opened the interview by asking Enrile, “What is the biggest fallacy that young people now are being fed about the reasons behind and the actual events of Martial Law?” (READ: #NeverAgain: Martial Law stories young people need to hear)
CLAIM: “They claimed that we killed a lot of people. That’s why when I was interviewed by someone some time ago, I challenged her: Name me one that we executed other than Lim Seng,” said Enrile. 
Enrile went on to say that it is “not true” that 70,000 people were arrested during the Marcos years, unless that number included ""the people who [violated] curfew and jaywalkers.”
Enrile also said that no one was arrested during Martial Law because of their political or religious beliefs or because they had opposed Marcos. 
“Name me one person that was arrested because of political or religious belief during that period. None…. Name me one person that was arrested simply because he criticized President Marcos. None,” said Enrile.
FACT: During the interview, Enrile was selective about his recollections. He excluded reference to the extrajudicial killings under Martial Law. (READ: FALSE: 'Only one executed,' 'none arrested' under Marcos' Martial Law – Enrile)
""Executed"" as used by Enrile in the interview appears to refer to the imposition of the death penalty by the government as punishment for a crime committed. Extrajudicial killings, which often target those who oppose the government, happen without the sanction of any legal process.

Lim Seng, whom Enrile mentioned in the interview, was executed through firing squad in 1973 because he was a Chinese drug lord. Enrile, however, erred in saying Seng was the only criminal executed by the government, because Canada-based The Ottawa Citizen reported another execution during Martial Law. The report said that on October 31, 1976, Marcelo San Jose was sentenced to death by electrocution.

As for extrajudicial killings, Amnesty International reported at least 3,240 people were killed from 1972 to 1981, while around 70,000 people were imprisoned, and 34,000 were tortured.

The late senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr, one of Marcos’ fiercest critics, was one of the first individuals arrested after Martial Law was proclaimed. (READ: LOOK BACK: The Aquino assassination) 
Aquino was placed under military trial after he was accused of murder, illegal possession of firearms, and subversion. He went on a hunger strike for 40 days from April 4 to May 13, 1975, to protest the “trumped-up charges” against him. 
In 1977, the military tribunal sentenced Aquino to die. The execution, however, was never carried out as Aquino was allowed to live in exile in the US.
Brave young Filipinos at the forefront of the anti-dictatorship movement were also imprisoned and killed during Martial Law. (READ: Gone too soon: 7 youth leaders killed under Martial Law)
Among them is 21-year-old Archimedes Trajano, who stood up during an August 1977 open forum where Bongbong's sister Imee Marcos, now Ilocos Norte governor, was a speaker. Trajano asked why she was the national chairperson of the Kabataang Barangay.
Witnesses said Trajano was seen forcibly taken from the venue by Imee's bodyguards, was tortured for 12 to 36 hours, and thrown out of a second floor window. His bloodied body was found in the streets of Manila on September 2, 1977.
Trajano's mother later sued Imee and former Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Fabian Ver before a district court in Honolulu, Hawaii, on March 20, 1986, about a month after the Marcos family moved there, following the EDSA People Power Revolution that toppled the Marcoses from power.
The Trajanos won the case in 1991, with the court awarding them $4.4 million. They then filed a civil case with the Pasig City Regional Trial Court in 1993 to collect the compensation from the Marcos family.
But in 2006, the Supreme Court voided the case and ruled in favor of Imee and Ver. (READ: How Imee Marcos got away from paying $4M in damages for Trajano death)
Years later, Republic Act (RA) No. 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013 created the Human Rights Victims' Claims Board, tasked ""to receive, evaluate, process, and investigate"" reparation claims made by victims of human rights violations under Martial Law.
Ironically, Enrile was the Senate president when RA 10368 was signed into law.
A total of 11,103 victims of human rights violations under Martial Law are now mandated to receive reparations for the abuses they endured. (READ: House OKs longer validity of Martial Law victims' compensation)
CLAIM: “During Martial Law, there were no massacres, like what happened in Mendiola during the supposed democratic government of Cory Aquino,” said Enrile. 
FACT: There were at least two massacres that happened during Martial Law. (READ: FALSE: 'No massacres' during Martial Law)
On September 24, 1974, military forces in pursuit of rebels from the Moro National Liberation Front gunned down more than 1,000 civilians praying in a mosque in Malisbong, Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat. This is known as the Malisbong massacre or the Palimbang massacre.
Details of a second massacre – the Bingcul massacre – were reported by various  newspapers based in the United States and Canada. On the evening of November 12, 1977, 7 uniformed men were reported to have entered Bingcul village somewhere in Mindanao and ordered 12 families to get out of their houses. 
The uniformed men made them squat then opened fire on them, killing 42 people. One adult and 3 children survived. 
CLAIM: Towards the end of the episode, Bongbong asked Enrile what convinced the government then that Marcos should already declare Martial Law. Enrile claimed the Jabidah massacre was a mere invention.
“It started when they invented the Jabidah massacre. I say invented because until now, I have not heard anyone who complained about anyone being massacred in Corregidor. No one. The only one who appeared as a member of the supposed Muslim trainees in Corregidor was that fellow who swam across Corregidor to Cavite, which was the invention of Montano and Ninoy Aquino. Because of that political outburst of Ninoy, we lost Sabah. That Jabidah massacre injured the political stature of the Marcos regime, followed by the Plaza Miranda grenading in 1971,” said Enrile. 
FACT: The Jabidah massacre happened on March 18, 1968, when at least 23 Muslim trainees were shot to death in Corregidor Island. The Marcos government, however, tried to cover it up. 
The inside story on the massacre was written by Rappler editor-at-large Marites Dañguilan Vitug and Rappler managing editor Glenda Gloria in one chapter of their book, ""Under the Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao,"" first published in 2000.
It all began with Oplan Merdeka, a clandestine operation hatched by Marcos in 1967 that sought the training of a special commando unit – named Jabidah – that would create havoc in Sabah, a territory claimed by the Philippines but occupied by Malaysia.
The plan was to send Muslim recruits to invade Sabah in 1968, but the operation ws botched.
On top of not receiving the stipends promised to them, the trainees had to endure harsh living conditions in Corregidor. They were also reportedly not informed that Oplan Merdeka's real purpose was to invade Sabah. Some of the trainees secretly wrote a petition addressed to Marcos to air their grievances.
Smelling a mutiny brewing, the training officers of the Jabidah unit transferred some recruits to other camps. But on March 18, 1968, some of the trainees were shot and burned – the bloodbath known as the Jabidah massacre.
The massacre sparked the decades-long armed struggle in Mindanao. The Bangsamoro people continue to demand justice for the Jabidah massacre victims to this day. – Rappler.com

Robredo calls it an insult,,"MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday, September 30, said that interpreting President Rodrigo Duterte's admission of extrajudicial killings merely as a joke is an insult to the victims' families.
""Kung nagbibiro man, dapat hindi iyon ginagawang biro. Insulto 'yon. Insulto 'yon sa napakaraming pamilya na naiwan ng mga napatay dahil sa extrajudicial killings,"" Robredo said on her Sunday radio program. (If he was joking, then that should not be treated as a joke. That's an insult. That's an insult to the many families left by those who died because of extrajudicial killings.)
Robredo added that ""it should be taken seriously,"" contrary to the stance of Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. She said that such admission could be used as an evidence for the complaint lodged against Duterte at the International Criminal Court (ICC).
""Hindi mo dapat 'hindi siniseryoso iyon,' dahil maraming buhay iyong nakitil doon… Tapos ngayon, parang sasambitin na parang wala lang? Kung iyon naman ay pagpapahayag ng isang katotohanan, parang sinusuportahan mo iyong kaso sa International Criminal Court, 'di ba?"" she said.
(You should not ""not take it seriously,"" because several lives were lost because of that. Now, it's being treated as if it's nothing? If that was an admission of truth, this supports your case at the International Criminal Court, right?)
Robredo also said that the confirmation that there are extrajudicial killings came from Duterte himself, as other government officials repeatedly refused to admit such killings. (READ: No extrajudicial killings in PH? World 'not fooled,' says HRW) 
""Kasi ano man iyong sabihin ng Presidente, nakaka-influence iyon ng policy. Nakaka-influence ito ng paano ang aksyon ng mga alagad ng batas, ‘di ba? Kapag Presidente iyong nagsabi na patayin iyong mga drug addict, nakita natin na talaga iyong patayan nandiyan,"" Robredo said.
(Whatever the President says, it influence policies. It influences how enforcers implement the law, right? If it was the President who said that drug addicts should be killed, we can see that there were indeed killings.)
Robredo reminded the public that Duterte's pronouncements serve as a declaration of policy, and that words of elected officials come with responsibilities. 
Malacañang, on the other hand, sought to clarify that Duterte's supposed admission to the killings should not be taken seriously. (READ: Not funny: CHR calls out Duterte over extrajudicial killings remark)

MANILA, Philippines – Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II allayed the fears of Senator Leila de Lima that she might become another victim of an extrajudicial killing if she would be put in jail.
Aguirre assured the senator, the fiercest critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, that she would be protected wherever she will be detained.
""Definitely, she will be safe kung saan man (wherever she is jailed). She will,"" Aguirre told reporters after his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, February 15.
He said he is 99% sure about that. Directly asked if De Lima might get killed, he said: ""Wala naman siguro (I don't think so). I'm sure, 99%.""
Asked for her reaction, De Lima questioned why there is still a 1% chance that she might die in jail.
""Eh di may 1% [chance] pa? Siguraduhin lang 'yung security kasi ano na 'yan eh, foregone conclusion na 'yan ang gagawin nila (So there's still a 1% chance? Security should be guaranteed because what they would do, it's a foregone conclusion),"" De Lima said, referring to the killings.
Expecting her arrest anytime soon, De Lima earlier requested that she be put in a ""safe and secure"" detention place.
She cited the case of former Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr, who was killed while inside a Leyte jail.
""Sakali lang po mangyari na, God forbid, sana ilagay naman ako sa isang lugar na safe and secure ako. Kasi marami na hong nangyayari 'di ba, pinapapatay sa loob ng selda, so what is another EJK?"" De Lima had said.

Tagbilaran City residents and hundreds of visitors from neighboring towns of Bohol province came to light candles, say prayers, and camp around open spaces at the St Joseph Catholic Cemetry, Bohol's biggest public cemetery located in Barangay Dampas, Tagbilaran City.
Security was tight in the area, with police and army troops patrolling the area around the clock.

Undas was relatively peaceful and orderly in the entire Central Visayas, according to the regional police.
“We are happy that the public is cooperating with the police even with the strict security measures we are implementing in cemeteries,” said Police Regional Office (PRO) VII Director Jose Mario Espino.
So far, no major incidents related to the observance of All Saints’ Day were reported in the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, and Siquijor.
In Cebu City, thousands of people trooped to the major cemeteries – the Carreta and Calamba cemeteries – to visit their departed loved ones. Espino said the relatively good weather prompted more people to visit the cemeteries early.
As of noon time, the police have seized bladed weapons, mostly those used in clearing tombs of weeds and plants, and bottles of alcoholic drinks.
Wanted man arrested in Cebu City
At the Carreta Cemetery, the police arrested a 27-year-old wanted man for carrying an unlicensed .38 caliber revolver inside the cemetery undetected by security personnel manning the entrance.
Waterfront Police Station chief Senior Inspector Jovito Labra said a concerned citizen informed the police about the suspect, Rolito Fernandez, who was seen carrying a .38 revolver inside the cemetery.
Labra said Fernandez, whom they found out has an arrest warrant for robbery, was immediately arrested by authorities.
Aside from deploying hundreds of policemen and security personnel at the different cemeteries in Central Visayas, Espino said policemen have also been deployed in various tourist destinations in the region. 
Security measures at Duterte parents' grave
In Davao City, the police have deployed forces to secure the Davao Roman Catholic Cemetery, also known as the Wireless Cemetery, for President Rodrigo Duterte's possible visit to his parents' grave on Wednesday. 
""The President is probably visiting so we've tightened our security there,"" Senior Police Inspector Maria Theresita Gaspan said in a radio interview on Monday, October 30.
""We've also mounted a security plan from road security down to perimeter security,"" added Gaspan.
In 2016, his first Undas as president, Duterte nearly failed to pay respects to his parents' grave due to bad weather. 
The President visits the grave of his parents – Davao Governor Vicente Gonzales Duterte and educator Soledad Roa – during All Saints' Day and on their death anniversaries and birthdays.
The President just returned from an official trip to Japan on Tuesday night.
On Wednesday afternoon, Special Assistant to the President Bong Go said Duterte was resting from his Japan trip, and would visit his parents' grave on Thursday, November 2, instead.

In a statement, the Rise Up for Life and for Rights network said authorities have a lot of explaining to do over the findings that only 1% of the total supply of illegal drugs in the Philippines has been seized by authorities.
""Napakahina ng PNP (Philippine National Police), akalain 'nyo, nabuwisan ng buhay ang mga dukha, samantalang 1% lang ng total ang nasamsam nilang shabu, iyan ba ang tinatawag nilang tagumpay?"" said Emily Soriano of Rise Up.
(The PNP is so inept. Imagine, the poor lost their actual lives, while authorities were only able to recover 1% of shabu. Is this what they call victory?)
""Humihingi kami ng matinding paliwanag. Bakit ninyo sinakripisyo ang aming mga anak at mahal sa buhay, samantalang napakahina ng inyong ginagawa para lutasin ang problema ng illegal drugs sa Pilipinas?"" she added.
(We're demanding a thorough explanation. Why did they sacrifice our children and loved ones, when authorities are practically doing nothing to solve the problem of illegal drugs in the Philippines?)
Robredo on Monday, January 6, called President Rodrigo Duterte's flagship program a ""failure,"" and gave the Duterte government a ""1 out of 100"" score as she released her findings during her 18-day stint as co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs.
Robredo's findings include that authorities were only able to seize less than 1% of the estimated 156,000 kilos of shabu consumed across the country every year. The Vice President also found that the Anti-Money Laundering Council only confiscated P1.4 billion worth of drug money from 2017 to 2018 out of the estimated P1.3 trillion a year. (READ: Here are reforms Robredo wants in Duterte gov't's drug war)
Duterte's war on drugs is widely criticized for the high number of killings. More than 6,000 people have been killed in anti-drug operations by police alone, while human rights groups estimate there may be as many as 27,000 deaths, including victims of vigilante-style killings. (READ: The Impunity Series)
Soriano said families of victims, Rise Up, and other human rights groups will continue to fight for justice. The Duterte government, she added, must pay its ""bloody debt.""
""Hindi kami titigil hangga't hindi nananagot si Duterte sa pagpaslang ng mga dukha,"" Soriano said. ""Oo, patay na sila at 'di na mababalik ang buhay, pero hustisya lang ang makapagbibigay sa amin ng katahimikan at kapayapaan."" 
(We will not stop until Duterte is made accountable for the killings of the poor. Yes, we cannot bring back the dead, but justice alone can give us peace and quiet.)
For rights group Karapatan, Robredo's report reaffirmed that the war on drugs is anti-poor.
""State policy of mass murder against the poor failed and has been ineffective in curbing the proliferation of illegal drugs and in resolving the root causes of such in the country – at the expense of millions of pesos in government funds and resources and thousands of lives,"" Karapatan secretary-general Cristina Palabay said. – Rappler.com

Kindly view at your own discretion.)
MANILA, Philippines – Liliosa Hilao, or Lilli to friends, was a consistent honor student and scholar of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM). The communication arts student, an active member of different student organizations, was due to graduate cum laude. (READ: '#NeverAgain: Martial law stories young people need to hear')
Her weak health did not stop her from being an active student leader. She was editor-in-chief of HASIK, PLM’s student publication that openly criticized the Marcos administration. Lilli was too sickly to rally on the streets and channeled her strength through her pen, writing thoughtful essays against the dictator’s regime. 
At 23, Lilli made it to history books and publications, but not because of her academic excellence nor her writing talent. She was the first female and student activist to die in detention during martial rule.
Lilli suffered a fate worse than death. 
Drunken soldiers from the Constabulary Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU) beat up Lilli and took her to Camp Crame. She was eventually found dead in the detention center. CANU reported she committed suicide by drinking muriatic acid, but her body showed signs of torture: her lips bore cigarette burns, her arms had injection marks, and her body was full of bruises. According to her sister, her internal organs were removed to cover signs of torture and possible sexual abuse.
Lilli’s tragedy is just one of the many stories of torture during the Marcos regime.
Worse than death
Amnesty International (AI) has estimated that during martial law, 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed. The AI mission, which visited the Philippines from November to December 1975, found that 71 of the 107 prisoners interviewed alleged that they had been tortured. 
Historian Michael Charleston Chua published a study entitled, ""TORTYUR: Human Rights Violations During The Marcos Regime,"" that detailed the different kinds of torture used by authorities during this dark chapter in Philippine history, as recounted by victims and published in different reports. 
According to Chua, here's what physical torture looked like during martial law: 
Electric shock - Electric wires are attached to the victim’s fingers, arms, head and in some cases, genitalia.
San Juanico Bridge - The victim lies between two beds and if his/her body falls, he/she will be beaten. 
Truth serum - An injection administered in hospitals and used for interrogation, making a victim ""talk drunkenly.""
Russian roulette - Loading a bullet into one chamber of a revolver, spinning the cylinder, and then forcing the victim to pull the trigger while pointing the gun at his/her own head. 
Beating - Victim is beaten by a group of soldiers.
Pistol-whipping - The victim is beaten with a rifle butt.
Water cure - Water is forced through the victim’s mouth and then forced out by beating. 
Strangulation - Constriction of the victim's neck done by hand, electric wire, or steel bar.
Cigar and flat iron burns - Victims of torture are inflicted with burns using cigarettes, and even a flat iron.
Pepper torture - A ""concentrated pepper substance"" is put on the victim’s lips or rubbed on his/her genitalia.
Animal treatment - The victim is shackled, caged, treated, and fed like an animal. 
Other forms of torture
Torture during martial law also came in non-physical forms. Chua noted that the regime also inflicted psychological and emotional torture to ""shake one’s principle."" This is done through solitary confinement and isolation. Some reported mental torture by threats of imminent death, rape, and harm to their families. 
Stories of sexual abuse were also prevalent inside detention centers. Women were stripped naked, made to sit on ice blocks, stand in cold rooms, and raped and sexually assaulted using objects such as eggplants smeared with chili peppers. 
The list of different methods of torture recounted by victims go on. (READ: '#AnimatED: Millennial, paano ka apektado ng martial law?' )
Even during martial rule, no amount of censorship nor state control could stop the horror stories from spreading then, as they got more and more atrocious every day. 
Survivors and families left behind by victims of the regime are still haunted by the trauma they and their loved ones suffered at the hands of those who had sworn to protect them. Decades after the Marcos regime, these stories continue to be told, serving as stark reminders of the country's darkest years.
Never again, the victims cry. – Rappler.com "

According to the Caloocan police's consolidated initial investigation report obtained by Rappler, cops were only forced to retaliate during the raid that claimed Delos Santos' life, which was part of the cops' one-time, big-time operation.
As told by PO3 Arnel Oares, it all happened at around 8:45 pm of August 16 with an 11-man team from Caloocan Police Community Precinct 7 (PCP-7) conducting an anti-drug and anti-crime operation at Block 7, Riverside, in Barangay 160.
Oares said they ""divided themselves into groups"" to cover more ground.
Oares, PO1 Jerwin Cruz, PO1 Jeremias Pereda, and a civilian informant formed ""one of the groups that crossed the basketball court."" Other groups were tasked to cover other narrow passages.
Oares and his team entered an alley ""on the right portion"" of the court and ""subsequently turned left.""
In that lane, they were met ""by several male persons who were scampering away after sensing the operation.""
Oares said in the report that they were ""prompted to go after"" the men, starting a chase.
He said they identified themselves as cops but the men did not stop.
As they reached the end of the path, described by Oares as ""a narrow road blocked by a concrete fence bordering Valenzuela City by [the] Tullahan River,"" shots were fired ""from their left side.""
He said the shots got them ducking, but they ""managed to spot the retreating male person.""
Oares then chased the gunman. The cop said he was ""prompted to return fire"" to prevent further aggression, and ended up killing the gunman.
The supposed gunman was Kian Loyd delos Santos.
Kian the family 'drug runner'?
Recovered from the scene were 4 fired cartridge cases, a caliber .45 pistol, and two transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substances believed to be shabu.
The next day, PCP-7 conducted another operation along Tullahan Road, Apple Ville, Barangay 162, resulting in the arrest of a certain Renato Loveras and ""3 other drug personalities.""
Loveras apparently told police that Delos Santos ""receives 10 grams of shabu daily,"" sometimes handed to him by a certain Jeslyn Escopin, daughter of arrested drug suspect Jessie Escopin.
The police report added that a background investigation on Saldy delos Santos, Kian's father, revealed that he was ""involved in criminal activities in the past.""
Despite accusations against the Delos Santos family, however, Metro Manila police chief Director Oscar Albayalde said they are focusing primarily on the allegation that the younger Delos Santos was a victim of an extrajudicial killing.
Based on CCTV footage and eyewitness reports, Delos Santos was unarmed, but given a gun by the police and coerced to run and shoot.
Countering reports
With doubts surrounding the narrative of Oares and his team, they have been placed under the Regional Personnel Holding and Accounting Unit – the unit where cops report daily when they are suspended.
Their supervisor, Police Chief Inspector Amor Cerillo, was also relieved and assigned to the holding unit.
The case of Delos Santos has sparked outrage in the country, with many believing there was foul play.
The cops are facing a probe by the Philippine National Police (PNP) Internal Affairs Service (IAS), but separate investigations are also being conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and Commission on Human Rights (CHR).
Senators allied with President Rodrigo Duterte are also calling for an inquiry into Delos Santos' death and the other recent killings in Duterte's war on drugs. – Rappler.com

Mangahas revealed the finding in an Inquirer column on Saturday, where he said the SWS found in June 2019 that 51% of Filipinos agreed with the statement: ""It is dangerous to print or broadcast anything critical of the administration, even if it is the truth.""
Meanwhile, 20% of Filipinos disagreed with the statement, making for a net +31 perception that it was risky to put out criticism of the administration.
Mangahas also revealed the June 2019 SWS survey showed 67% agreed ""mass media in the Philippines have freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press."" On the other hand, 10% disagreed, he said, making for a net +57 ""affirmation of media’s constitutional guarantee of freedom.""
According to Mangahas, this showed ""that those seeing danger in publicizing criticism of the administration feel personally much freer to dissent (net +57) than those seeing no danger in it (net +24).""
For respondents who agreed with media’s freedom of expression, Mangahas said results showed they ""feel personally very free to dissent (net +56), whereas the few who deny media’s freedom to dissent do NOT feel personally free to do so themselves (net -25).""
Fear in surveys?
Mangahas was responding to former editor and Inquirer columnist John Nery's column last July 30, which raised the question of whether or not ""a climate of fear now colors all surveys.""
Nery highlighted how a December 2018 SWS survey – which found 74% of Filipinos were satisfied with President Rodrigo Duterte's peformance – also showed 78% said they feared they or someone they know would become a victim of an extrajudicial killing.
Nery said this showed SWS should include the survey question every quarter. ""It must explain to the public how, or whether, almost complete administration control over every level of government affects survey-taking,"" he said.
""Duterte supporters and government officials must learn not simply to stand behind the President’s high ratings, but reconcile the difference between public opinion that supports the President and public opinion that consistently expresses deep anxiety over the President’s signature program,"" Nery added.
But Mangahas said SWS assessed respondents' fear not by asking them their fear of being a victim of extrajudicial killings, but by asking them to agree/disagree with the following statement: “I can say anything I want, openly and without fear, even if it is against the administration.""
SWS survey results, he said, showed that under the Duterte administration 5 surveys revealed net ""personal freedom to dissent"" ranged from a moderate +23 to a strong +41.
The question was first introduced in July 1985, during the Marcos dictatorship, in a survey done for the Bishops-Businessmen’s Conference for Human Development. At the time, Mangahas said, personal freedom to dissent was at an all time low of +3 net agreement.
According to Mangahas, the net ""personal freedom to dissent"" under Duterte was not ""unusual"" considering previous presidents like Fidel V Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III showed similar results.
""Freedom of speech has been probed 40 times from 1985 to the present. Its net score averaged +33 during the administration of Cory Aquino, +38 in the time of Fidel Ramos, +41 in the time of Joseph Estrada, +34 in the time of Gloria Arroyo, and +32 in the time of Noynoy Aquino,"" SWS said. 
""From 1986 to now, personal freedom to dissent never returned to single-digit,"" Mangahas added. 
The June 2019 SWS was conducted from June 22-26, 2019 through face-to-face interviews with 1,200 adults nationwide: 300 each in Metro Manila, Balance of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The survey saw a sampling error margins of ±3% for national percentages, and ±6% each for Metro Manila, Balance of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
Filipinos and freedom
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said, the Palace was ""curious as to why"" 51% of Filipinos felt it was dangerous to publish anything critical of the Duterte administration.  
He said: ""The President respects criticisms as long as the same is not baseless, unfounded or false. He even urges the people, including writers and reporters, to freely express whatever sentiments they have.""
On the other hand, he added that the results which showed Filipinos agreed there was press freedom was ""a repudiation of the vociferous and unrelenting tirade of the critics and detractors of the President, as well as the opposition, that the freedoms of speech and of expression are being curtailed by the Administration. The survey rating means we have a vibrant and robust exercise of those freedoms."" 
In a statement Tuesday, August 6, the group Let's Organize for Democracy and Integrity (LODI) said the SWS' survey results attested to ""Filipinos’ love for freedom and their defiance of the regime’s attempts to impose full-scale tyranny. ""
""The oft-peddled claim of massive support for the President’s most oppressive policies crumbles amid the clear findings of the SWS survey: Those who report or express views critical of Duterte face safety issues. Yet those who believe they face clear danger refuse to crumble,"" LODI said.
The group likewise denounced attacks on press freedom such as the red-tagging of journalists, cyberattacks on alternative news websites, Duterte's threats to deny ABS-CBN its franchise renewal, harassment cases filed against Rappler, and the spread of fake news and troll accounts.
LODI added, ""Filipinos continue to exercise their rights by asking questions, expressing themselves and taking direct action. Because that’s what a freedom-loving people do in the face of a rising tyrant allergic of transparency and the breakdown of institutions supposedly holding him accountable."" – Rappler.com

Solve killings first,,"
ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE, Philippines – The Diocese of Dipolog has strongly condemned the series of unsolved extra-judicial killings in Zamboanga del Norte, especially in Dipolog City and Sindangan town, and urged the government to act on the cases.
Bishop Severo C. Caermare and priests in the diocese made the statement read in all masses celebrated in the diocese on Sunday, February 1.
“We cannot be at peace and remain indifferent with these occurrences of cases of killings,"" they said.
Caermare, the youngest bishop in the Philippines, leads 71 priests in the diocese. He is known as the motorcycle-riding bishop who draws the faithful wherever he celebrates mass.
“For the people of God especially the families of the victims and those who choose to be silent because of fear, we are at your side, we feel your pain and we are one with you in prayer that justice be attained,” the diocese said in its statement.
The bishop and priests also appealed to the Philippine National Police (PNP), the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), and the Department of Justice (DOJ)  to continue upholding the rule of law and let the “wheels of justice run its course.”
They also urged government officials and all the laity to collaborate to help victims achieve justice and to stop extra-judicial killings, which “desecrate the basic dignity of life, the rule of law and the family.”
Probe
Justice Secretary Leila de Lima had earlier ordered the NBI to look into the spate of killings in the province.
Lawyer Sally Hans C. Barbaso, Agent-in-Charge of the NBI-Dipolog District Office, admitted they were in “limbo” on their investigation until December 5, 2014, when a known drug pusher and police asset, Arthur Barbaso, was, shot to death. 
The victim’s companion, Ronald Realiza – also a drug pusher and police asset – sought NBI protection, claiming that he could be the next target because he saw Barbaso's killer.
Realiza told the NBI that the suspect is a non-regular employee of the Dipolog city government and assigned to work under a group of policemen tasked to fight the proliferation of drugs in the city.
On January 9, the local NBI office submitted to the Dipolog City Prosecutor their investigation report with recommendation for prosecution of the suspect in the killing of  Barbaso, a police officer and 3 John Does.
The NBI investigation report was later sent to the national office of the Justice Department. Almost a month later, Caermare and his priests issued the statement condemning the killings. – Rappler.com "
